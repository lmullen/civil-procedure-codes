Either party may exhibit to the other, or to his attorney, at any time before the trial, any document or paper, material to the action, and request an admission in writing of its genuineness. If the adverse party or his attorney fail to give the admission Within four days after the request, and if the party exhibiting the document or paper, be afterwards put to expense, in order to prove its genuineness, and the same be finally proved or admitted on the trial, such expense to be ascertained at the trial, must be paid by the party refusing the admission; unless it appear to the satisfaction of the court, that there were good reasons for the refusal.
