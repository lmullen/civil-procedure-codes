The service of a subpoena is made, by showing the original, and delivering a copy or a ticket, containing its substance, to the witness personally, giving or offering to him at the same time, the fees, to which he is entitled, for travel to and from the place designated, and one day’s attendance there. Such service must be made, so as to allow the witness a reasonable time, for preparation and travel to the place of attendance.
