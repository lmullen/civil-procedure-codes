If a person arrested be kept in a house other than the county jail, neither the officer arresting him, nor the person in whose custody he is, can receive from him a greater sum for lodging or necessaries, than is prescribed by the county judge. If no such rate have been prescribed, the officer or person in whose custody the prisoner is, cannot receive a greater sum than may be allowed by a justice of the peace, of the town, on proof that the lodging or necessaries were furnished at the request of the prisoner. And no compensation can in any case be received, for intoxicating liquors sold or delivered to the prisoner.
