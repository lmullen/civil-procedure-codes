In an action in the supreme court, a county judge, in addition to the powers conferred upon him by this code, may exercise, within his county, the powers of a judge of the supreme court out of court as provided in section 222. And in all cases where an order is made by a county judge, it may be reviewed in the same manner, as if it had been made by a judge of the supreme court.
