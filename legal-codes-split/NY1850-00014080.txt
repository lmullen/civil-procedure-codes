A defendant appears in an action when he answers, demurs, or gives the plaintifff written notice of his appearance. After appearance, otherwise than by answer, a defendant is entitled to notice of all subsequent proceedings, in the same manner as if he had answered. But where a defendant has not appeared, service of notice or papers, in the ordinary proceedings in an action, need not be made upon him, unless he be imprisoned for want of bail.
