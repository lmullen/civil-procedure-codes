There is in each of the counties of this state, (except, that for this purpose, Fulton and Hamilton are deemed one county,) a court, denominated the court of oyer and terminer, with the jurisdiction conferred by the next three sections, and no other. But nothing contained in this section, affects its jurisdiction in actions or proceedings now pending therein: nor does it affect any judgment or order already made, or proceeding already taken.
