If the defendant, at any time before the trial, offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken against him for a specified sum, the plaintifff may immediately have judgment thereforee, with the costs then accrued. But if he do not accept such offer before the trial, and fail to recover in the action a sum equal to the offer, he cannot recover costs accrued after the offer: but costs must be adjudged against him, and if he recover, deducted from his recovery. But the offer, and failure to accept it, cannot be given in evidence, to affect the recovery, otherwise than as to costs, as above provided.
