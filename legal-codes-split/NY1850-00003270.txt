The assessors must divide the justice’s jury list into parts, corresponding, in a town, with the number of justices therein ; and in a city, with the number of justice’s districts therein, and must deliver to each justice in a town and justice’s clerk in a city, his jury list, duly certified by them. They must also, without delay, transmit to the county clerk’s office, the county jury list, certified by them. On the justice’s jury list in cities, there must be placed those jurors only who reside in the city; and in all cases the jurors who reside nearest the justice’s office, must, as far as practicable, be placed on his list. The number of jurors on the lists may be unequal, reference being bad to the location and estimated amount of business of each justice.
