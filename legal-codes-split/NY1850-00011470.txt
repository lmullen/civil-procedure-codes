No person is liable to an action as executor of his own wrong, for having taken, received, or interfered with, the property of a deceased person; but is responsible to the executors, or general or special administrators, of such deceased person, for the value of all property so taken or received, and for all damages, caused by his acts, to the estate of the deceased.
