If the sheriff, on being arrested by a coroner, on an order of arrest in a civil action, neglect to give bail or make a deposit of money instead thereof, or if he be arrested on an execution against his body, or on a commitment, he must be confined by the coroner, in a house within the jail liberties, other than the house of the sheriff or the county jail, in the same manner as the sheriff is required to confine a prisoner in the county jail. The house in which he is thus confined, thereupon becomes, for that purpose, the county jail. If a person be arrested by a coroner, on process in an action in which the sheriff is plaintifff, he must, when his commitment is required by this code, be committed to the county jail; but the coroner is not liable for his escape from the jail, after: he is committed thereto.
