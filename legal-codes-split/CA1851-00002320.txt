Where a judgment requires the payment of money, or the
delivery of real or personal property, the same shall be enforced in those

respects, by execution. Where it requires the performance of any other
set, a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the party
against whom it is given, or upon the person or officer who is required
thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and his obedience thereto enforced.
