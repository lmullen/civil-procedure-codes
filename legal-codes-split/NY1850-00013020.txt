In case of the sickness, other disability, or necessary absence of a justice, at the time appointed, another justice of the same town may, at his request, attend in his behalf, and shall thereupon become vested with the power, for the time being, of the justice before whom the summons was returnable. In that case the proper entry of the proceeding before the attending justice, subscribed by him, must be made in the docket of the justice before whom the summons was returnable. If the case be adjourned, the justice before whom the summons was returnable, must resume jurisdiction.
