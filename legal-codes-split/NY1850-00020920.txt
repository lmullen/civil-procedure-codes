Every person who has been in good faith, served with a subpoena, to attend as a witness before a court, judge, commissioner, referee, or other person, in a case where the disobedience of the witness may be punished as a contempt, is exonerated from arrest, in a civil action, while going to the place of attendance, necessarily remaining there, and returning therefrom. The arrest of a witness contrary to this section is void, and when willfully made, is a contempt of the court; and the person making it, is responsible to the witness arrested, for double the amount of the damages which may be assessed against him, and is also liable to an action at the suit of the party serving the witness with the subpoena, for the damages sustained by him in consequence of the arrest.
