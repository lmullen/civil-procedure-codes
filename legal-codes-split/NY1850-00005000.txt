If a person in the custody of the sheriff of the county for which the designation has been made, be entitled to the jail liberties, he must be confined within the jail liberties, of the original county, as if no such designation had been made, but may be removed by the sheriff to the jail so designated, and confined therein, in the same cases and in the same manner, as he might legally confine him in the jail of his own county.
