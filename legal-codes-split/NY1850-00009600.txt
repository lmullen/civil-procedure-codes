On filing a judgment roll, upon a judgment requiring the payment of money, the judgment may be docketed with the clerk of the county where it was rendered, and in any other county, upon filing with the clerk thereof a transcript of the original docket; and thereupon the judgment becomes a lien on real property in the county, from the time of docketing it therein.
