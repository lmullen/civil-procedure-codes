When the inquisition does not state, that the disability is likely to be permanent, the surrogate must, before ordering a sale, ascertain the probable necessary expenditure over the annual income, for a period not exceeding three years in advance, and must limit the sale or mortgage, to so much of the real property as can be sold or mortgaged separately, without material injury to the residue of the property, and as may be sufficient to raise such sum, and in all cases he must first ascertain by evidence the present condition of the person. Further sales or mortgages may be ordered from time to time, as may be necessary.
