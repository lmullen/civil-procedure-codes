Upon an execution issued on a justice’s judgment docketed in a county clerk’s office, the same fees are allowed as on executions issued by a justice; except that when real property is sold, the printer’s fees for advertising may be charged in addition, and also, the same fees for a certificate of sale, and for a sheriff’s deed, as are allowed in the supreme court.
