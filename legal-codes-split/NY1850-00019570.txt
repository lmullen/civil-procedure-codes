The effect of the judgment of any other tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment, is as follows: 1. In case of a judgment against a specific thing, the judgment is conclusive, upon the title to the thing: 2. ln case of a judgment against a person, the judgment is presumptive evidence of a right, as between the parties, and their successors in interest by a subsequent title, and can only be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud or clear mistake of law or fact.
