In pleading a judgment or other determination of a Court or
Oflicer of especial jurisdiction, it shall not be necessary to state the
facts conferring jurisdiction, but such judgment or determination may
be stated to have been duly given or made. If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be bound to establish on the trial the
facts conferring jurisdiction.
