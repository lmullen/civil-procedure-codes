When the affidavit and notice of appeal have been served, the respondent may supply or correct material omissions or misstatements therein by an affidavit on his part, a copy of which must be served on the attorney, if any, who prosecutes the appeal, or if there be none, on the appellant, if to be found in the county, at least one day before the time for hearing the appeal.
