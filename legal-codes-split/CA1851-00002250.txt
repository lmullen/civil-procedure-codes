Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered in the Clerk’s
docket upon an execution returned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment
of contract filed with the Clerk, made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property, by the judgment Creditor; or
within one year after the judgment by the Attorney, unless a revocation
of his authority be previously filed. Whenever a judgment shall be
satisfied in fact, otherwise than upon an execution,_it shall be the duty
of the party, or Attorney, to give such acknowledgment, and upon
motion the Court may compel it, or may order the‘ entry of satisfaction
to be made without it.
