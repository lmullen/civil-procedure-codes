Whenever, in the exercise of its authority, a court shall have ordered the deposit, or delivery, of money or other thing, and the order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the disobedience, may make an order requiring the sheriff to take the money or thing, and deposit or deliver it, in conformity with the direction of the court.
