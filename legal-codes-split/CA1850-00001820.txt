Where a judgment requires the payment of money or the delivery of real or personal property,
the same may be enforced in those respects by execution, as provided by this Act. Where it requires
the performance of any other act, a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the party against

whom it is given, or the person or officer who is required thereby or by law to obey the same, and his
obedience thereto enforced. If he refuse, he may be punished by the court as for a contempt.
