The defendant may set forth, by answer, as many defenses and counterclaims as he may have. They must each be separately stated, and the several defenses must refer to the causes of action which they are intended to answer, in a manner by which they may be intelligibly distinguished. The defendant may also answer one or more of the several causes of action alleged in the complaint and demur to the residue.
