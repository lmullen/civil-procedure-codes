Impose as a condition of making the order, that the client give security, in a form and amount to directed, to satisfy the lien, when determined in an action; or, 2. Summarily inquire into the facts on which the claim of a lien is founded, and determine the same: or, 3. Direct the trial of the controversy by a jury, or refer it, and upon the verdict, or report, determine the same, as in other cases.
