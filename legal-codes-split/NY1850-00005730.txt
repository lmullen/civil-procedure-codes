When money is brought or paid into court, (except a justice’s court,) in an action or special proceeding, the clerk must within five days thereafter, pay it to the county treasurer of the county, unless it be ordered by the court to be paid to another county treasurer, or to be invested or disposed of as provided in section 493. The county treasurer must thereupon make an entry, stating the amount thereof, the time when, and by or for whom, and in what action or proceeding it was so deposited, and the time from which the interest thereon, if any, is to commence.
