Offends against any of the provisions of the act or acts creating, altering, or renewing, such corporation; or 2. Violates the provisions of any law, by which such Corporation forfeits its charter, by abuse of its powers; or 3. Whenever it has forfeited its privileges or franchises, by failure to exercise its powers; or 4.
