There is in each of the counties of this state, except the city and county of New-York, a county court, with the jurisdiction conferred by the next two sections, and no other. But nothing contained in this section affects its jurisdiction in actions or proceedings now pending therein; nor does it affect any judgment or order already made, or proceeding already taken.
