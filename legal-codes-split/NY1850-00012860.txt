An execution may, at the request of the plaintifff, be renewed before the expiration of sixty days from the time of its issue, by the word renewed written thereon, with the date thereof, and subscribed by the justice. Such renewal has the effect of an original issue; and may be repeated as often as may be necessary. If an execution be returned unsatisfied, another may be afterwards issued.
