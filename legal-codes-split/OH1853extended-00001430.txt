N o variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof, is to be deemed material, pnless it have
actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. Whenever
it is alleged, that a party has been so misled, that fact must
be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and it must also
be shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended,
upon such terms as may be just. .
