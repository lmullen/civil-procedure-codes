The verdict of a jury is either general or spwial. A general
verdict is that by which they pronounce generally upon all or any of the
issues, either in favor of the plaintifff or defendant; a special verdict is
that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the
Court. The special verdict shall present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them ; and those
conclusions of fact shall be so presented, as that nothing shall remain to
the Court but to draw from them conclusions of law.
