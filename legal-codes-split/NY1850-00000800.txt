The present chief justice shall continue to act as such, until his office shall expire or become vacant. In either of these events, the judges then in office shall, by an order entered upon the minutes, designate one of their number as chief justice, who shall act as such until his office shall expire or become vacant; and so on, from time to time, as often as the office of the judge designated as chief justice shall expire or become vacant.
