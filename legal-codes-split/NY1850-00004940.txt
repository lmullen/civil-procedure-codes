Male and female prisoners, (except husband and wife,) must not be kept or put in the same room. The supervisors of each county must as soon as can conveniently be done, so construct or alter the jail or other prison of the county, as to enable the sheriff to confine all persons committed for trial or upon conviction for public offenses, in separate rooms. And after such provision is made, each person must be confined in a separate room, and not be permitted to associate with another prisoner.
