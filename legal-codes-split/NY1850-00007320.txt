A copy of the complaint must be served with the summons, unless the complaint itself be already on the files of the court. In the latter case, the service of a copy with the summons may be omitted, but then the summons must state where the complaint is filed; and if the defendant, within ten days thereafter, in person or by attorney, demand in writing, a copy of the complaint, specifying a place within the state where it may be served, a copy thereof must be served accordingly, and after such service the defendant has twenty days to answer; but only one copy need be served on the same attorney.
