No adjournment can be granted after the return of the jury, unless the party requiring the same, in addition to the other conditions imposed on him, deposit with the justice, to be immediately paid to the jurors attending, the sum of twenty-five cents each, which amount is in no case to be included as part of the costs in the judgment. After the adjournment the jurors must attend at the time and place appointed, without further notice, and the fees deposited when the jury was demanded, with the justice, may remain in his hands until the jury are empaneled, and must be then paid over to them.
