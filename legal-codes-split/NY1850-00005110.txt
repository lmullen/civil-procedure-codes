On the written application of the sheriff, with the assent of the county judge, or in the city of New-York, of the recorder or city judge, the governor may authorize the sheriff to organize a guard, not exceeding a specified number, for the protection of the county jail or any other prison in the county, or to arrest or detain a prisoner, or to enforce the process, order or judgment of a court. He may also authorize the sheriff to contract with one or more uniform companies to form the guard, and may at any time revoke or modify the authority.
