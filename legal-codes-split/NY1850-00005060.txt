When a pesfilence or contagious disease breaks out in or near to a jail, and the physician thereof certifies that it is likely to endanger the health of the prisoners, the county judge of the county, or the mayor or recorder of a city in which it is situated, may, by a written appointment, designate a safe and convenient place in the county, or the jail of a contiguous county, as the place of their confinement. The appointment must be filed in the office of the county clerk, and must authorize the sheriff to remove the prisoners to the place or jail designated, and there confine them, until they can be safely returned to the jail from which they were taken.
