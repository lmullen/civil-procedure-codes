These courts must be held by the county judge, together with two justices of the sessions, designated as provided by other statutes. If the justices of the sessions, or either of them, be absent at a term of a court of sessions, or the office of those justices or either of them, be vacant, the county judge may supply the vacancy or deficiency for the term by designating the requisite number to form the court, from the justices of the peace of the county.
