No preference can be given by any next kin, legatee, heir or devisee, to one debt over another of the same class, except one specified in the second subdivision of the last section; nor is a debt, due and payable, entitled to a preference over a debt not due; nor does the commencement of an action against any next of kin, legatee, heir or devisee, for the recovery of a debt, entitle it to a preference over others of the same class.
