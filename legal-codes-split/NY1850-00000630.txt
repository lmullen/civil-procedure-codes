In addition to these special terms, the court is always open, before each of the judges, for the hearing of motions, applications for judgment upon failure to answer, and upon complaint and answer, and for the trial of issues of law. But a judge who appoints for that purpose a certain day in each week when not sitting at a general term or circuit, is not required to hear a contested motion or trial at any other time.
