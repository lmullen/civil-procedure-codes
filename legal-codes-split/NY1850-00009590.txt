Immediately after entering the judgment, the clerk must attach together and file the following papers, which constitute the judgment roll: 1. In case the complaint be not answered by any defendant, the summons and complaint, or copies thereof, proof of service, and that no answer has been received, the report, if any, and a copy of the judgment. 2. In all other cases, the summons, pleadings, or copies thereof, and a copy of the judgment with any verdict or report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions, and all orders relating to a change of parties, or in any way involving the merits and necessarily affecting the judgment. If a statement of the case be made, the same may be attached to the judgment roll, on the request of either party, and thenceforth forms a part thereof. When the defendant is entitled to judgment, if the plaintifff shall not have filed the summons, with proof of service and the pleadings on his part, the copies of summons and pleadings served on the defendant, may be substituted thereforee in making the judgment roll, or the plaintifff may, at the instance of the defendant, be ordered by a judge forthwith to file such papers. Upon an exemplification of a judgment, as evidence only that part of the roll which consists of the summons, pleadings, and judgment need be given.
