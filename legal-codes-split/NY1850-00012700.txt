Judgment that the action be dismissed, with out prejudice to a new action, may be entered with costs, in the following cases: 1. When the plaintifff voluntarily dismisses the action, before it is finally submitted: 2. When he fails to appear at the time specified in the summons, or upon adjournment, or within one hour thereafter: 3. When it is objected at the trial, and appears by the evidence, that the action is brought in the wrong county or town or by a plaintifff not a resident of the county, without giving security, as provided in section 1082; but if the objection be taken and overruled, it is cause only of reversal on appeal, and does not otherwise invalidate the judgment, if not taken, at the trial, it is waived, and is no cause of reversal.
