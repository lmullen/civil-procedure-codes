When the jail liberties have not been established, and in counties hereafter erected, the supervisors of the county must appoint a reasonable space of ground, adjacent to the jail of the county, to be denominated the jail liberties, as follows: 1. The liberties must be laid out as nearly as maybe, in a square; except that a stream of water, canal or highway, may be adopted as an exterior line, though not in a straight line, or at right angles with the other exterior lines: 2. They must not exceed five hundred acres in extent, and must include the courthouse, and the office of the county clerk: 3. A minute description of their boundaries and extent, must be filed with the county clerk: 4. The boundaries and limits of the liberties must be designated, by visible and permanent objects.
