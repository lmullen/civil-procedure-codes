An injunction is a writ or order, requiring a person to refrain from a particular act. When granted as a provisional remedy, it is by order. The order may be made by the court in which the action is brought, or by a judge thereof, in the cases prescribed in the next section; and when made by a judge, may be enforced as the order of the court.
