Any person having a just claim, who has not been included in the list of creditors, or of persons entitled to distribution, or has not had his just share of the assets at any former distribution, may appear and establish his claim, before the final dividend, and shall thereupon be entitled to his full share out of the remaining assets, if sufficient remain to make his payment or distributive share, equal, in proportion to its amount, to that of other claims of the same class at all former dividends, and may thereafter receive with others his just proportion.
