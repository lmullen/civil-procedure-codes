It is the duty of every justice, upon the expiration of his term of office, to deposit with his successor his official dockets, as well his own as those of his predecessor, which may be in his custody; there to be kept as public records. If the office of a justice become vacant, by his death, or removal from the town or otherwise, before his successor is elected and qualified, the dockets, in possession of such justice, must be deposited with the supervisor of the town, to be by him delivered to the successor in office of the justice.
