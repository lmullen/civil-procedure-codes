The questions arising on the complaint and answer must be tried by the justice, or, if either party demand it, a jury must be summoned to try the question of fact, if any. The jury must be formed as in justices’ courts, and the provisions of this code, respecting trials by jury in justices’ courts, apply to trials by jury under this chapter.
