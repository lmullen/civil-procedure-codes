The pleadings may be amended, at any time before the trial, or during the trial, or upon appeal, to supply any deficiency or omissions in the allegations or denial, necessary to support the action or defense when by such amendment, substantial justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made after the issue, and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court by oath, that an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party, in consequence of such amendment, an adjournment must be granted. The court may also, in its discretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the court, not exceeding three dollars; but such payment cannot be required, unless an adjournment is made necessary by the amendment; nor can an amendment be allowed after a witness is sworn on the trial, when an adjournment thereby will be made necessary.
