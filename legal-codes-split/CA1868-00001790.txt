Proceedings upon claim of another party to properly,
or on denial of indebtedness to judgment debtor.

If it appear that a person or corporation, alleged to have
property of the judgment debtor or indebted to him, claims
an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debt,
the Court or Judge may authorize, by an order made to that
effect, the judgment creditor to institute an action against
such person or corporation for the recovery of such interest
or debt; and the Court or Judge may, by order, forbid a
transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt, until an
action can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment. Such
order may be modified or vacated by the Judge granting the
same, or the Court in which the action is brought, at any
time, upon such terms as may be just.

See N Y. Code, g 299. Aplicable to Justices’ Courts.
