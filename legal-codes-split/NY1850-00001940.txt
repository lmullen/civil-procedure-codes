The marine court of the city of New-York has jurisdiction of the following actions and proceedings: 1. Of the actions and proceedings enumerated in sections 153 to 155, both inclusive: 2. Of an action between a person belonging to a vessel in the merchant service, and the owner, master or commander thereof, demanding compensation for the performance, or damages for the violation of a contract for services on board the vessel, during a voyage performed, in whole or in part, or intended to be performed by the vessel, though the sum demanded exceed one hundred dollars. 3. Of an action by or against a person belonging to or on board of a vessel in the merchant service, for an assault and battery or false imprisonment, committed on board the vessel, upon the high seas, or in a place without the United States, of which the ordinary courts of this state have jurisdiction, though the damages demanded exceed one hundred dollars. But nothing in this or the last subdivision of this section, gives this court power to proceed, in any of the cases therein referred to, as a court of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.
