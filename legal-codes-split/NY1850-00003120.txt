The drawing must be conducted, as follows: 1. The clerk must shake the box containing the ballots, so as to mingle them as much as possible: 2. He must then publicly draw out of the box, as many of the ballots as there are grand jurors required: 3. A minute of the drawing must be kept, in which the name contained on each ballot drawn must be entered, before another ballot can be drawn: 4. If, when the whole number of ballots required is drawn, it appear that a person, whose name is drawn, is dead or insane, or resides out of the county, that fact must be entered in the minute of the drawing, and the ballot containing the name, destroyed: 5. Another ballot must then be drawn in place of that destroyed, and the name contained thereon must in the same manner he entered in the minute of the drawing: 6. The same proceedings must be had, as often as necessary, until the requisite number of ballots is drawn: 7. The minute of the drawing must then be signed by the clerk and the attending officers, and immediately filed in the clerk’s office.
