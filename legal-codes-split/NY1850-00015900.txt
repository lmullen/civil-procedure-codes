Entry upon real property can only be made, where entry is given by law, and then it must not be made forcibly; and an entry peaceably made, must not be forcibly maintained, against one who is entitled to the possession. A forcible entry or detention, within the meaning of this section, is one made with weapons, an unusual number of persons, or threats of violence, or attended with any other breach of the peace.
