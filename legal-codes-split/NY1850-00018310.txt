The widow to whom dower is admeasured, after the expiration of twenty days from the date of the confirmation, unless the same be appealed from, may, if possession be withheld or her right denied, bring an action to recover the possession of the lands so admeasured to her for her dower, and, upon recovery, may hold the same during her life, subject to the payment of all taxes and charges accruing thereon, subsequent to her taking possession.
