In an action in which the cause of action, after the commencement of the action, by assignment, or in any other manner, becomes the property of a person not a party to the action, and the prosecution or defense is thereafter continued, such person is liable for the costs, in the same manner as if he were a party, and payment thereof may be enforced by order.
