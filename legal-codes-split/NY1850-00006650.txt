No cause of action or defense to an action arising out of the title to real property, or to rents or services out of the same, can be effectual, unless it appear that the person prosecuting the action, or making the defense, or under whose title the action is prosecuted or the defense is made, or the ancestor, predecessor, or grantor of such person, was seised or possessed of the property in question, within twenty years before the commission of the act in respect to which such action is prosecuted or defense made.
