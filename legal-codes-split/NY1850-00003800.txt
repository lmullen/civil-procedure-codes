At the time appointed, the county clerk must attend at his office, with the list of trial jurors of the county, and publicly select the persons to form the jury in the following manner: 1. He must select from the trial jury list, the names of forty-eight persons, indifferent between the parties, and in his judgment best qualified to try the question: 2. The parties or their attorneys, must then, alternately, commencing with the party who obtained the order, strike out one of the names of the persons selected, until each party shall have stricken out twelve names: 3. If either party fail to attend, or neglect to strike out twelve names as provided in the last subdivision, the clerk must do so for him: 4. The clerk must thereupon deliver to the sheriff, a panel of the twenty-four persons not stricken out, and must certify that they are the persons selected to form the special jury.
