The writs heretofore known as prerogative writs, so far as they are hereafter to be recognized, shall be denominated state writs. They are issued out of the supreme court at the instance of the state, sometimes on behalf of private persons, for the protection of private rights, and sometimes for purposes of state. They are issued in the name of the people, under the seal of the court, and the signature of the clerk.
