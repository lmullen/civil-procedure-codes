Immediately after filing a judgment-roll, the clerk shall make
the proper entries of the judgment, under appropriate heads, in the docket
kept by him; and from the time the judgment is docketed, it shall become
a lien upon all the real property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from
execution, in the county, owned by him at the time, or which he may
afterwards acquire, until the said lien expires. The lien shall continue for
two years, unless the judgment be previously satisfied.
