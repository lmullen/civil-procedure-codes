If the sheriff or coroner, on being arrested by a person specially appointed to execute the office of sheriff, or by elisors, on an order of arrest in a civil action, neglect to give bail or make a deposit of money instead thereof, or if he be arrested on execution against his body, or on attachment, he must be confined in a house within the jail liberties, other than the house of the sheriff or the county jail, in the same manner as the sheriff is required to confine a prisoner in the county jail. The house in which he is thus confined, thereupon becomes, for that purpose, the county jail.
