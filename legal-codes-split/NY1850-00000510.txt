The state is divided into eight judicial districts, of which the city of New-York is the first, the others being created by special statutes; in each of which there are four judges of this court, and as many more in the first district as may be from time to time authorized by law, but not to exceed in the whole, such number in proportion to its population, as shall be in conformity with the number of such judges in the residue of the state, in proportion to its population.
