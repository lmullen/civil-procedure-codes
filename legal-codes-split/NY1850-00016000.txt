For the execution of a judgment of removal a warrant must be signed by the justice and delivered to the sheriff of the county, or to the marshal or constable of the city or town in which the property is situated, commanding him to remove the defendant from the property, and put the plaintifff into possession thereof; and to collect the costs of the proceedings specified in the warrant. The officer to whom the warrant is directed and delivered, must execute the same as prescribed in section 1426, and must collect the costs in the same manner, as upon a judgment in a justice’s court.
