When the decision of a Court of inferior jurisdiction in a
special proceeding, is brought before a Court of higher jurisdiction
for a review in any other way than by appeal, the same costs shall be
allowed as in cases on appeal, and may be collected by execution, or in
such manner as the Court may direct, according to the nature of the case.
