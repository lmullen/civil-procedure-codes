When a contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court or officer, it may be punished summarily, for which an order must be made reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view, and presence, adjudging that the person proceeded against, is thereby guilty of a contempt, and that he be punished as therein described. Such punishment, however, cannot exceed that prescribed by section 1478. Where the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, an affidavit must be presented to the court, or officer, of the facts constituting the contempt.
