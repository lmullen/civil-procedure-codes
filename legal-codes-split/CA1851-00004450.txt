Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be sworn, or to
answer as a witness, or to subscribe an aleavit or deposition when
required, may be punished as a contempt by the Court, or officer issuing
the subpoena, or requiring the witness to be sworn; and if the witness be
a party, his complaint may be dismissed, or his answer stricken out.
