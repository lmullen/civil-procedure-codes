The justice elected to fill a vacancy, or when elected, chosen by lot to fill a vacancy for less than a full term, is deemed the successor of the justice whose office became vacant before the expiration of a full term. When a full term expires, the same or another person elected to take office in the same town, from that time is deemed the successor.
