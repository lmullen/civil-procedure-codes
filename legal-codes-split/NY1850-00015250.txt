A writ of deliverance must be served by an elector of this state, and the service thereof is not deemed complete, unless the person, serving it, tenders to the person, in whose custody the prisoner may be, if such person be a sheriff; coroner, constable or marshal the fees allowed by law for bringing up the party, nor unless he also give an undertaking to such officer, to the effect that the charges of carrying back the party if remanded, shall be paid, and that he shall not escape by the way, either in going to or returning from the place to which he is to be taken. But this section does not apply to a case, where the writ is issued on the application of the attorney general, or by the district attorney.
