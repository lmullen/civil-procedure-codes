The judge must proceed to examine the account and the objection, pursuant to the notice, on the day specified, or on some other day to which the examination may be adjourned, and may, when it involves the taking of oral testimony, or the examination of numerous vouchers, refer the same to a referee, to hear the parties and their evidence, and if necessary, restate the account. Upon filing the report of a referee, on a receiver’s account, an opportunity must be given to the parties interested to be heard.
