The execution must be directed to a constable of the county, and subscribed by the justice by whom the judgment was rendered, or by his successor in office, and must bear date of the day of its delivery to the officer to be executed. It must intelligibly refer to the judgment, by stating the names of the parties, and the name of the justice before whom, and of the county and town where, and the time when, it was rendered; the amount of the judgment; and, if less than the whole is due, the true amount due thereon. It must require the constable substantially as follows: 1. If it be a case where the defendant cannot be arrested, it must direct the officer to collect the amount of the judgment out of the personal property of the debtor, and to pay the same to the party entitled thereto: 2. If it be a case where the defendant may be arrested, in addition to the foregoing, it must direct the officer, if sufficient property of the defendant liable to the execution cannot be found to satisfy the judgment, that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county, until he pay the judgment, or be discharged according to law: 3. It must further, in all cases, direct the officer to make return of the execution, and a certificate thereon, showing the manner in which he has executed the same, in sixty days from the time of his receipt thereof.
