The clerk of each of the courts mentioned in section 389, must within one week after the close of a term or circuit, prepare duplicate reports of the business in his court, by filing the blanks transmitted to him by the attorney general, pursuant to notice, one of which duplicates must be filed and preserved in his office, and the other he must immediately transmit to the attorney general. For his services under this section, the clerk is entitled to the same fees as for certified copies of papers; and the expense thereof is a county charge.
