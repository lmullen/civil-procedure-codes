The court or judge, by whom the warrant is issued, may also, at the same time, or afterwards, issue a precept to the sheriff, or other person to whom the warrant was directed, commanding him, to bring forthwith the party for whose benefit the writ of deliverance was granted; and he shall thereafter remain in the custody of such sheriff or person, until discharged or remanded.
