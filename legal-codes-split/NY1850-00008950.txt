A motion to postpone a trial for the absence of evidence, can only be made upon affidavit, showing the materiality of the evidence expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has been used to procure it. The court may also require the moving party to state the evidence which he expects to obtain, and if the adverse party thereupon admit, that such evidence would be given, and that it be considered as actually given on the trial, or offered and overruled as improper, the trial must not be postponed.
