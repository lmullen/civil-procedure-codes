Any person having in his custody or power, or under his restraint, a party, who, by the provisions of this chapter, would be entitled to a writ of deliverance or for whose relief a writ of deliverance has been issued, who, with intent to elude the service of the writ, or to avoid the effect thereof, transfers the party to the custody, or places him under the power or control, of another, or conceals or changes the place of his confinement, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
