After the issuing of an execution against property, and upon proof by affidavit; of a party or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, or a judge thereof; or county judge, that any judgment debtor has property, which he unjustly refuses to apply towards the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or judge may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear at a specified time and place, to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had, for the application of the property of the judgment debtor towards the satisfaction of the judgment, as are provided, upon the return of an execution.
