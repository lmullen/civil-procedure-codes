If such consent be not given, filed, and entered, as provided in;
the last section, at or before a judgment of sale is rendered, the court shall
ascertain and determine what proportion of the proceeds of the sale, after
deducting expenses, will be a just and reasonable sum to be allowed on
account of such estate; and shall order the same to be paid to such party,
or deposited in court for him, as the case may require.
