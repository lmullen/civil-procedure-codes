Upon the evidence so taken, the court or officer must determine, whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he is guilty of the contempt, a fine must be imposed upon him, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, or he must be imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both. But in the discretion of the court, or officer, (in case of inability to pay the fine, or endure the imprisonment,) he may be relieved in such manner and upon such terms as may be just.
