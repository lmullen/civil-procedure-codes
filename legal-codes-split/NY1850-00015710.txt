The sale must be by public auction, between the hours of nine in the forenoon, and four in the afternoon. If the mortgaged property be situated in a city or village, the sale must be therein, otherwise it may be in any part of the county where the property lies. If the property be a farm, or distinct lot, lying partly in two or more counties, the sale must be in the county where the mansion house, or chief building on the property is situated, or if there be none, or two or more in different counties, the sale may be in either county. If the property consist of distinct farms or parcels, they must be sold separately, but when a part has been sold for sufficient to satisfy the amount due and costs, another parcel cannot be sold.
