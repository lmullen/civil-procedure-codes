A witness once examined, cannot be re-examined as to the same matter, without leave of the court, But he may be re-examined as to any new matter, upon which he has been examined by the adverse party. And after the examinations on both sides are once concluded, the witness cannot be recalled without leave of the court. Leave is granted or withheld, in the exercise of a sound discretion.
