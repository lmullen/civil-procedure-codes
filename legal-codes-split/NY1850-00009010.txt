When the jury is completed and sworn, the ballots containing the names of the jurors sworn must be laid aside, till the jury so sworn is discharged, and then they must be returned to the box; and every ballot drawn containing the name of a juror not so sworn must be returned to the box as soon as the jury is completed.
