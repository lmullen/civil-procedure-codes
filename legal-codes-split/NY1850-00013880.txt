If the plaintifff do not accept the offer, he must prove the amount to be recovered, as if the offer had not been made, and cannot be permitted to give it in evidence. And if the amount assessed in his favor do not exceed the sum mentioned in the offer, the defendant may recover his expenses, incurred in consequence of any necessary preparation or defense in respect to the question of amount. Such expense must be ascertained at the trial.
