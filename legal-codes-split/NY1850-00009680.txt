The writ of execution must be directed to the sheriff, subscribed by the party issuing it, or his attorney, and must intelligibly refer to the judgment, stating the court, the county where the judgment roll or transcript is filed, the names of the parties, the amount of the judgment, if it be for money, the amount actually due thereon, and the time of docketing in the county to which the execution is issued, and must require the sheriff substantially as follows: 1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, out of his real property, or if the judgment be a lien on real property, then out of the real property belonging to him on the day when the judgment was docketed in the county, or at any time thereafter, or if the judgment be entered pursuant to the first subdivision of section 632, the execution must conform to such judgment: 2. If it be against real or personal property, in the hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, tenants of real property, or trustees, it must require the sheriff to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of such property: 3. If it be against the person of the judgment debtor, it must require the sheriff to arrest such debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county, until he pay the judgment, with interest, or be discharged according to law: 4. If it be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it must require the sheriff to deliver the possession of the same, particularly describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and may at the same time require the sheriff to satisfy any costs, charges, damages, rents or profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it was rendered, and the value of the property for which the judgment was recovered, to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of real property, as provided in the first subdivision of this section, and in that respect it is to be deemed an execution against property.
