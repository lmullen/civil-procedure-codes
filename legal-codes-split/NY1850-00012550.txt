The defendant is not at liberty to give evidence, by which the question of title to real property is raised on the trial before a justice. And when from the plaintifff’s own showing, on the trial, it appears that the determination of the action will necessarily involve the decision of a question of title to real property, the justice must dismiss the action, with costs, stating on his docket the reason thereforee; but such dismissal shall not preclude the plaintifff from an action in the supreme court for the same cause.
