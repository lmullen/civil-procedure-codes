An action may be brought by the attorney general in the name of the people of this state, upon his own information, or upon the complaint of a private party, against the party offending in the following cases: 1. When any person usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises any public office, civil or military, or any franchise within this state, or any office in a corporation created by the authority of this state: or, 2. When any public officer, civil or military, has done or suffered an act which, by the provisions of law, makes a forfeiture of his office: or, 3. When any association, or number of persons, act within this state as a corporation, without being duly incorporated. And it is the duty of the attorney general to bring the action, whenever he has reason to believe that any of these acts can be proved, or when he is directed to do so, by a judge of the supreme court.
