When the action is on a promissory note, bill of exchange, or other obligation for the payment of money only, or for a specified amount of property, at a valuation fixed in the contract, or on an account, the plaintifff may serve, with the summons, a copy of his complaint, together with a copy of such obligation or account. In such case, unless the defendant, in his answer, specifically deny the note, bill of exchange, or other obligation or account, he is to be deemed to have admitted it.
