If, after the return of a trial jury list, the commissioner of jurors discover that the name of a person, qualified to act as a juror and not exempt, has been omitted, he must give written notice to the person so omitted, to appear at his office at a specified time, at least five days after the service, to show cause why his name should not be placed on the trial jury list. The notice must be served on the person to whom it is directed, personally, or by delivering it to a person of suitable age and discretion, at his place of residence.
