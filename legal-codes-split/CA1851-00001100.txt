The defendant may, within two days after the service of a
copy of the affidavit and undertaking, give notice to the Sheriff that he
excepts to the sufliciency of the sureties. If he fails to do so, he shall
be deemed to have waived all objection to them. When the defendant
excepts, the sureties shall justify on notice in like manner as upon bail
on arrest; and the Sheriff shall be responsible for the suthiency of the
sureties until the objection to them is either waived, as above provided,

or until they justify. If the defendant except to the sureties, he cannot
reclaim the property as provided in the next section.
