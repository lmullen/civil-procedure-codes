Any sale or lease made for the purpose of satisfying the assessments, mentioned in the third subdivision of section 1484, must be made within three years after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners. Such sale must be reported to the court, which may confirm it, or for good cause order a resale, but no sale can in any case be made, or lease granted, for a longer period than twelve years.
