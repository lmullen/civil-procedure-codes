When it appears that the occupant, or those under whom he claims, entered into the possession of land under claim of title, exclusive of other right, making such claim upon a written instrument, as being a conveyance of the land in question, or upon the judgment of a competent court; and that there has been a continued occupation and possession of the land included in such instrument, or judgment, or of some part of the land, under such claim, for twenty years, the land so included is deemed to have been held adversely, except that when it consists of a tract divided into lots, the possession of one lot is not deemed a possession of any other lot of the same tract.
