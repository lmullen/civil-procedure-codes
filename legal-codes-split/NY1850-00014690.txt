Whenever a peremptory mandate is directed by a public officer, body, or board, commanding the performance of any public duty, specially enjoined by law, if it appear to the court that such officer, or any member of such body, or board, has, without just excuse refused or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a fine, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, upon every such officer or member of such body or board. Such line, when collected must be paid into the treasury; and the payment thereof is a bar to an action, for any penalty incurred by such officer or member of such body or board, by reason of his refusal or neglect to perform the duty so enjoined.
