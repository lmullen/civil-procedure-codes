If there be a subscribing witness to a writing, produced in evidence, its execution must be proved by him, if he can be produced, and can testify. If there be more than one subscribing witness, the evidence of one is sufficient. If all the subscribing witnesses be dead, or out of the jurisdiction, or incapable of attending or testifying, or cannot be found, the handwriting of one of them, and that of the party must be proved.
