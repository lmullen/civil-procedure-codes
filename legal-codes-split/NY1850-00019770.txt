The original writing must be produced and proved, except as provided in section 1688. If it have been lost, proof of the loss must first be made, before evidence can be given of its contents. Upon such proof being made, together with proof of the due execution of the writing, its contents may be proved by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the recollection of a witness, as provided in section 1688.
