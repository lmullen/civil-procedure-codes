Whenever any party to an action who holds a lien upon the
property, or any part thereof, has other securities for the payment of the
amount of such lien, the Court may, in its discretion, order such securitiw to be exhausted before a distribution of the proceeds of sale, or may
order a just deduction to be made from the amount of the lien on the
property, on account thereof.
