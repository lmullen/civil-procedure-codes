If any of the property attached be perishable, the sheriff must sell the same in the manner in which property is sold on execution, and immediately deposit the proceeds with the clerk of the court. He must also collect, and if necessary, in his name of office, sue for the debts and credits attached, and deposit the amount collected with the clerk. Other property attached by him, must be retained by him to answer any judgment that may be recovered in the action, unless sooner subjected to execution upon another judgment.
