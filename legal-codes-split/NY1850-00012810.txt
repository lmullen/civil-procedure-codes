Upon an execution on a judgment against joint debtors, upon one or more of whom the summons was not served, the execution must contain a direction to collect the amount out of the joint property of all the defendants, or the separate property of the persons upon whom the summons was served, to be specified by name. If such judgment be also such that the defendants are subject to arrest thereon, the justice must further specify the names of those defendants, served with the summons, who may be arrested for want of property.
