The commissioners are entitled for their services, to the same fees as referees, but such fees, in the aggregate, can never exceed one hundred dollars to each commissioner. Necessary surveyor‘s fees, not exceeding two hundred dollars, and clerk’s fees, for copies of papers, at the rate of live cents for every hundred words, may also be included in the assessment. No other fees, costs or expenses of any kind, for any local improvement, or upon any assessment, or for proceedings in relation thereto, can be made a charge upon the property.
