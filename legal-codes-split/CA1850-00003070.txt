A party examined by an adverse party, as herein provided, may be examined on his own
behalf in respect to any matter pertinentto the issue. But if he testify to any new matter not responsive
to the inquiries put to him by the adverse party, or necessary to explain or qualify his answer thereto,
or discharge, when his answer would charge himself, such adverse party may offer himself as a witness
on his own behalf, in respect to such new matter, and shall be so received.
