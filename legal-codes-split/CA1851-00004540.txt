A party to an action or proceeding may be examined as a
witness, at the instance of the adverse party, or of any one of several
adverse parties; and for that purpose may be compelled, in the same
manner, and subject to the same rules of examination as any other
witness, to testify at the trial, and he may be examined on a commission.
