A copy of the judicial record of a foreign country is also admissible in evidence upon proof; 1. That the copy offered has been compared by the witness with the original, and is an exact transcript of the whole of it: 2. That such original was in the custody of the clerk of the court, or other legal keeper of the same: and 3. That the copy is duly attested by a seal, which is proved to be the seal of the court where the record remains, if it be the record of a court, or if there be no such seal, or if it be not a record of a court, by the signature of the legal keeper of the original.
