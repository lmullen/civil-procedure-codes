If an answer be made which raises a question as to a matter of
fact essential to the determination of the motion, and affecting the substantial rights of the parties, and upon the supposed truth of the allegation of
which the application for the writ is based, the court may, in its discretion,
order the question to be tried before a jury, and postpone the argument
until such trial can be had, and the verdict certified to the court. The
question to be tried shall be distinctly stated in the order for trial, and the
county shall be designated in which the same shall be 'had. The order may
also direct the jury to assess any damages which the applicant may have
sustained in case they find for him.
