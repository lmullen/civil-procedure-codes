A receiver, before entering upon his duties, must be sworn—faithfully to discharge his trust, to the best of his ability, and must also file with the clerk of the court, an undertaking in writing, of one or more sufficient sureties, in a specified sum, fixed by the court or officer, to the effect that he will faithfully discharge the duties of receiver, and will obey the orders of the court or officer in respect thereto. The sureties must justify in the same manner as bail upon an arrest.
