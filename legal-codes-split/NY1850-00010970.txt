If a sale of the property, including such estate, be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or person passes thereby; and the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, shall hold the property discharged from all claims, by virtue of such estate or interest, whether the same be to the individual share of a joint tenant, or tenant in common, or to the whole or any part of the property sold.
