Name of person entitled to ojice may be set forth in the
complaint ; if fees have been received by the usmjoer he may be
arrested.

Whenever such action is brought, the Attorney General, in
addition to the statement of the cause of action, may also set
forth in the complaint the name of the person rightly entitled
to the office, with a statement of his right thereto; and in
such case, upon proof by affidavit that the defendant has received fees or emoluments belonging to the office, and by
means of his usurpation thereof, an order may be granted
by a Judge of the Supreme Court, or a District Judge, for
the arrest of such defendant, and holding him to bail; and
thereupon he may be arrested, and held to bail, in the same
manner, and with the same effect, and subject to the ‘same
rights and liabilities, as in other civil actions where the defendant is subject to arrest.
