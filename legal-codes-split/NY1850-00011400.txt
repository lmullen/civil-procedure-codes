When the death of one is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the personal representatives of the former may maintain an action thereforee against the latter, if the former might have maintained an action, had he lived, against the latter, for an injury caused by the same act or omission. But the action must be commenced, within two years after the act or omission, by which the death was caused; the damages thereon cannot exceed dye thousand dollars; and the amount recovered is to be for the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin, to be distributed to them in the same proportions as the personal property of the deceased person.
