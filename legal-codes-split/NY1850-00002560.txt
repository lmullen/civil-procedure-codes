No removal can be made by the concurrent resolution of both houses of the legislature, or by the senate on the recommendation of the governor, as provided in the last two sections, unless the cause thereof be entered on the journals, nor unless the party complained of shall have been served with a copy of the complaint against him, and shall have had an opportunity of being heard in his defense. On the question of removal, the ayes and noes must be entered on the journal.
