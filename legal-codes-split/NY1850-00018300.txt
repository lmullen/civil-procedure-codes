The admeasurement so made and confirmed, shall, at the expiration of twenty days from the date of such confirmation, unless appealed from, be binding and conclusive, as to the location and extent of the widow's right of dower, on the parties who applied for the same, and on all parties to whom notice has been given, as hereinafter directed. But no person shall be precluded thereby from controverting the right of such widow to the dower so admeasured.
