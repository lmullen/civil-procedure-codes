Whenever an order for the payment of a sum of money is made by a court pursuant to a provision of this code, the same may be enforced by execution, in the same manner, as if it were a judgment, except that the person cannot be arrested unless specially directed in the order, not can real property be sold thereon, except in the cases where the same is by law a charge upon real property.
