In all cases where a sheriff, coroner, or other
officer, shall by virtue of an execution, levy upon any goods
and chattels which shall remain upon his hands unsold, for
want of bidders, for the want of time to advertise and sell,
or any other reasonable cause, the officer may, for his own
security, take of the defendant an undertaking, with security,
in such sum as he may deem sufficient, to the effect that the
said pro erty shall be delivered to the officer holding an execution En the sale of the same, at the time and place appointed by said officer, either by notice given in writing to
said defendant in execution, or by advertisement, published
in a newspaper printed in the county, naming therein the
day and place of sale. If the defendant shall fail to deliver
the goods and chattels at the time and'place mentioned in
the notice to him given, or to pay to the officer holding the

execution the full value of said goods and chattels, or the
amount of said debt and costs, the undertaking, given as
aforesaid, shall be considered as broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases.
