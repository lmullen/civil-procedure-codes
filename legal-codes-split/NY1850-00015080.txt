The party produced, on the return of a writ of deliverance, may deny any of the material facts set forth in the return, or may allege any fact, to show, either that his imprisonment or restraint is unlawful, or that he is entitled to his discharge; which allegation or denial must be on oath; and, thereupon, the court or judge must proceed in a summary way, to hear such evidence as may be produced, in support of the imprisonment or detention, or against the same, and to dispose of the party, as the justice of the case may require.
