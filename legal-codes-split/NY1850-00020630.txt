Either party may attend such examination, and put such questions, direct and cross, as may be proper, and the deposition must be certified by the officer, and filed with the clerk, or if the parties so agree, deposited with some other person, and may thereupon be used by either party upon the trial, motion, or other proceeding, against any party giving or receiving the notice, subject to all legal exceptions. But no objection to the relevancy of testimony can be made at the trial unless the same were stated at the time of the examination. If the deposition be taken under subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, of section 1821, proof must also be made that the witness continues absent or infirm.
