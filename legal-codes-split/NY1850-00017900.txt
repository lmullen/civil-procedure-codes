The fees of the surrogate, on the appointment of a committee, are the same, as on the proof of a will, and for his removal, and the proceedings in relation thereto, the same as for similar services in case of administrators. Upon a trial before him, the surrogate may order costs to be paid, either by a party, or out of the funds or estate, to any other party, not exceeding the costs allowed for the trial of a civil action.
