Evidence of the publication of a document or notice required by law, or by an order of a court or judge, to be published in a newspaper, may be given by the affidavit of the printer of the newspaper, or his foreman or principal clerk, annexed to a copy of the document or notice, specifying the times when, and the paper in which, the publication was made. But such affidavit must be made within six months after the last day of publication.
