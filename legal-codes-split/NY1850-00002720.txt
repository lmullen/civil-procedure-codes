In a county in which there is no special county judge, in case of inability of the surrogate, or of a vacancy in his office, his powers and duties devolve on the county judge, or if the office of judge and surrogate are united in the same person, then on the district attorney, during the vacancy or in the particular case. In the city of New-York, if the surrogate be unable to act, or there be a vacancy in his office, one of the judges of the court of common pleas, to be designated by the mayor of that city, must act as surrogate during the disability or vacancy.
