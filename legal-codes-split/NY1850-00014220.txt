When a cause of action has arisen in a sister state, or in a foreign country, and by the laws thereof, an action thereon cannot there be maintained against a person by reason of the lapse of time, an action thereon cannot be maintained against him in this state, except in favor of a citizen thereof, who has had the cause of action from the time it accrued.
