Whenever, in the opinion of the court, it is proper that the jury should have a view of real property which is the subject of the litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order the jury to be conducted in a body, in the custody of proper officers, to the place, which will be shown to them by the judge, or by a person appointed by the court for that purpose. While the jury are thus absent, no person, other than the judge or person so appointed, must speak to them on any subject connected with the trial.
