If the property be so redeemed, by a redemptioner, either the judgment debtor or another redemptioner, may within thirty days after the last redemption, again redeem it from the last redemptioner on paying the sum paid on his redemption, with interest, and, unless his lien be prior to that of the proceeding redemptioner, the amount of such lien, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as the debtor or owner, or any redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any redemptioner within thirty days after his redemption, and notice thereof filed with the sheriff. If no redemption is made in sixty days after the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a conveyance; or if so redeemed, whenever thirty days have elapsed, and no redemption has been made and notified therein, the time for redemption has expired, and the last redemptioner is entitled to a sheriff’s deed. If the debtor or owner redeem at any time before the time for redemption expires, the effects of the sale are terminated, and he is restored to his estate.
