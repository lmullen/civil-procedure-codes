When the action is called for trial by jury, the clerk must draw from the trial jury box of the court, the ballots containing the names of jurors, until the jury is completed or the ballots are exhausted. If the ballots become exhausted before the jury is complete, the sheriff, under the direction of the court, must summon from the bystanders or the body of the county, so many qualified persons as to complete the jury.
