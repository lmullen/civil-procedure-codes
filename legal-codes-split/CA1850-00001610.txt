In every action for the recovery of money only, or specific real property, the jury in their
discretion may render a general or special verdict. In all other cases the court may direct the jury to
find a special verdict in writing upon all or any of the issues, and in all cases may instruct them, if they
render a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in writing, and may direct
a written finding thereon. The special verdict or finding shall be filed with the Clerk and entered upon
the minutes.
