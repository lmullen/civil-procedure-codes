If the property levied on be claimed by a third person as his property, the sheriff may summon from his county any twelve persons, qualified as jurors between the parties, to try the validity of the claim. They and the witnesses must be sworn by the sheriff, and if their verdict be in favor of the claimant, the sheriff may relinquish the levy, unless the judgment creditor give him a sufficient indemnity for proceeding thereon. The fees of the jury must be paid by the claimant, if the verdict be against him, otherwise by the plaintifff.
