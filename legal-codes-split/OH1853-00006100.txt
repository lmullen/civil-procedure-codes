The writ is either alternative or peremptory. The
alternative writ must state concisely the facts showing the
obligation of the defendant to perform the act, and his omission to perform it, and command him, that immediately upon
the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, he do
the act required to be performed, or show cause before the
court whence the writ issued, at a specified time and place,
why he has not done so; and that he, then and there, return
the writ,-with his certificate of having done as he is commanded. The peremptory writ must be in a similar form,
exce t that the words requiring the defendant to show cause
why he has not done as commanded, must be omitted.
