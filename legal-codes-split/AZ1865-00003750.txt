A witness shall answer questions legal and pertinent to the
matter in issue, though his answer may establish a claim against himself;
but he need not give an answer which will have a tendency to subject him
to punishment for a felony, nor need give an answer which will have a
direct tendency to degrade his character, unless it be to the very fact in
issue or to a fact from which the fact at issue would be presumed. But a
witness shall answer as to the fact of his previous conviction for felony.
