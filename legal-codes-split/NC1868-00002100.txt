—Controversy, how snbmltted without action.

Parties to a question in difference, which might be the
subject of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon a
case containing the facts upon which the controversy
depends, and present a submission of the same to any court
which would have jurisdiction if an action had been brought.
But it must appear by affidavit that the controversy is real,
and the proceeding in good faith, to determine the rights
of the parties. The Judge shall thereupon hear and determine the case, and render judgment thereon, as if an action

were depending.
