Anything which is injurious to health, or indecent, or offensive
to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, is a nuisance,
and the subject of an action. Such action may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment
is lessened by the nuisance; and by the judgment, the nuisance may be
enjoined or abated, as well as damages recovered.
