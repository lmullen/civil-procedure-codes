The judge may order any property of the Judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands either of himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards the satisfaction of the judgment, except that the earnings of the debtor for his personal services, at any time within thirty days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied, when it is made to appear by the debtor’s affidavit, or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.
