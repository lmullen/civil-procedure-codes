In case of a judgment of suspension or removal, the accused may, within ten days after it is pronounced, make a case, setting forth the evidence and other proceedings in the matter upon the hearing thereof; which must be settled by the court in the same manner as a case in a civil action. When settled, it must be filed with the clerk of the court by which the judgment was given.
