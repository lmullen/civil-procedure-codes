If the property, or any part thereof, be concealed in a building or enclosure, the Sheriff shall publicly demand its delivery; if it be
not delivered, he shall cause the building or enclosure to be broken open,
and take the property into his possession; and if necessary, he may call
to his aid the power of his county.
