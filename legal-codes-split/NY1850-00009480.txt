Any party may, and if required by the court, must when the evidence is closed, submit in distinct and concise propositions, the conclusions of fact which he claims to be established, or the conclusions of law, which he desires to have adjudged, or both; they may be written and handed to the court, or at the option of the court, oral and entered in the judge’s minutes; but in either case they must be entered with any exceptions that may be taken, if either party require it.
