If a party refuse to attend and testify at the trial, or to give
his deposition before trial, or upon a commission when required, his
complaint, answer, or reply may be stricken out, and judgment be taken
against him; and he may be also, in the discretion of the Court, proceeded against as in other cases for a contempt. _
