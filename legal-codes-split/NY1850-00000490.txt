In addition to the jurisdiction conferred by the last two sections, this court has the jurisdiction heretofore transferred to it, 1. Of all suits and proceedings now undetermined, and which were pending on the first Monday of July, 1847, in the late supreme court and court of chancery, and in the late courts of common pleas, except in suits originally commenced in justices’ courts: 2. To enforce the orders, judgments and decrees of those courts, rendered before that day, or to exercise such other powers in respect thereto, as it might exercise, if they had been made or rendered by this court.
