The judgment given on a trial, to be had under the last two sections, must be annexed to the judgment roll of the former trial, and the judgment last given shall be the final determination of the rights of the parties. If a prior judgment shall have been executed, restitution must be ordered, as the last judgment may determine the rights of the parties, and the same may be enforced by execution.
