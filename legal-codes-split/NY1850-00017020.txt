If the judge be satisfied that the application and schedule are in conformity with this chapter, and if there appear sufficient ground for the application, but not otherwise, he must order notice to be given to all the stockholders, creditors and others interested, to show cause, if they have any, at a specified time and place, why the corporation should not be dissolved. He may also, if the nature of the case require it, restrain, by injunction, the sale or transfer of any property, or the transaction of any business, by or on behalf of such corporation, until the further order of the court, and may, also, then or afterwards, appoint a receiver, if in his opinion, it be necessary.
