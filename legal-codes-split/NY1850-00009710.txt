After the lapse of five years from the entry of judgment, if no execution have been already issued, an execution can be issued only by leave of the court on motion, upon notice to the adverse party. Such leave must not be given unless it be established by the oath of the party, or other proof, that the judgment, or some part thereof, remains unsatisfied and due. When the judgment has been rendered in a justice’s court, and docketed in the office of the clerk of the county, the application for leave to issue execution must be to the county court of the county where the judgment was rendered, or in the city and county of New-York, to the court of common pleas of that city, and such court has jurisdiction over the judgment and execution.
