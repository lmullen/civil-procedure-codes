In all cases of sales in partition, when it appears that a married woman has an inchoate right of dower in any of the property divided or sold, or that any person has a vested or contingent future right or estate therein, the court must ascertain and settle the proportional value of such inchoate, contingent or vested right .or estate, according to the principles of law applicable to annuities and survivorships, and must direct such proportion of the proceeds of the sale to be invested, secured, or paid over in such manner, as to protect the rights and interests of the parties.
