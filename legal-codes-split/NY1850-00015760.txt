Upon the application for confirmation, or upon a day to which it may be adjourned, the judge, may correct any error that may appear in the statement of the amount due on the mortgage; and for that purpose may examine witnesses, or receive other evidence. If it appear to his satisfaction, by the evidence, and by inspection of the mortgage, or other collateral contract, that the holder was entitled to foreclose by reason of default in payment, and that all the proceedings have been in conformity with this chapter, he must confirm the foreclosure and sale, by an order indorsed on or attached to, the affidavits or certificate and to be filed and recorded therewith in the office of the county clerk.
