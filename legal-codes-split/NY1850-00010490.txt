Real property adjudged to be sold, must be sold in the county where it lies, by the sheriff of the county, or by a referee, appointed by the court for that purpose, and thereupon the sheriff or referee must execute a conveyance to the purchaser, which conveyance passes the title of the parties to the action. And upon the sale of property, real or personal, pursuant to a judgment, the court may enforce the delivery of possession thereof to the purchaser.
