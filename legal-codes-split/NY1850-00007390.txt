If the summons be not personally served on a defendant, nor received by him through the post office, in the cases provided for in the last two sections, he or his representatives, on application and sufficient cause shown, at any time before judgment, must be allowed to defend the action; and, except in an action for divorce, the defendant or his representatives, may in like manner, be allowed to defend after judgment, or at any time within one year after notice thereof, and within seven years after its rendition, on such terms as may be just; and if the defense be successful, and the judgment, or any part thereof, have been collected or otherwise enforced, such restitution may thereupon be compelled as the court directs.
