The order must direct the publication to be made in two newspapers to be designated, as most likely to give notice to the person to be served, and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, not less than once a week, for six weeks. In case of publication, the court or judge must also direct a copy of the summons and complaint, to be forthwith deposited in the post office, directed to the person to be served, at his place of residence, unless it appear that such residence is neither known to the party making the application, nor can with reasonable diligence be ascertained by him. When publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the summons and complaint, out of the state, is equivalent to publication, and deposit in the post office. In either case the service of the summons is to be deemed complete, at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication.
