All rules of the common law and all statutes now in force, conferring or defining the jurisdiction of the supreme court, are abrogated and repealed, and it has no other jurisdiction than that prescribed in the next five sections. But the repeal contained in this section does not affect its jurisdiction of actions or proceedings now pending, or heretofore had therein, nor does it any judgment or order already made, or proceeding already taken.
