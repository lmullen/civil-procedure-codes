A written will cannot be revoked or altered, otherwise than by another written will, or another writing of the testator, declaring such revocation or alteration, and executed with the same formalities, required by law for the will itself; or unless the will be burnt, torn, cancelled, obliterated or destroyed, with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the same, by the testator himself, or by another person, in his presence, by his direction and consent; and when so done by another person, the direction and consent of the testator, and the fact of such injury or destruction, must be proved by at least two witnesses.
