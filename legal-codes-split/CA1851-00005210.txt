When a peremptory mandate has been issued and directed to
any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, if it appear to the
Court that any member of such tribunal, corporation, or board, or such
person upon whom the writ has been personally served, has, without
just excuse, refused or neglected to obey the same, the Court may, upon
motion, impose a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. In case of
persistance in a refusal of obedience, the Court may order the party to
be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three months, and may take
any orders necessary and proper. for the complete enforcement of the
writ. If a fine be imposed upon a judge or oHicer who draws a salary
from the State or County, a certified copy of the order shall be forwarded
to the Comptroller, or County Treasurer, as the case may be, and the
amount thereof may be retained from the salary of such judge or officer.
Such judge or oHicer for his willful disobedience shall also be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor in office.
