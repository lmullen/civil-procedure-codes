Upon the application to confirm the sale, or at such other time as the judge may then appoint, he must proceed to determine in a summary manner, the right of any person entitled to an interest in surplus money arising on a sale. He must also make such order as may be necessary for the disposition of any money in the sheriff’s hands. His orders in the case may be enforced in the same manner as orders in actions, and disobedience thereof may be punished in the same manner.
