In a justice’s court where the court has authority to enter the judgment, the statement may be filed with the justice, who must thereupon enter in his docket, a judgment of his court, for the amount confessed, with one dollar costs. If a transcript of such judgment be filed with the county clerk, a copy of the statement must be filed with it.
