Upon proof that a person, whose name is on the trial jury list, is exempt for any of the causes mentioned in section 252, and not otherwise, the commissioner of jurors must strike his name from the list, and enter in a book known as the exemption register, 1. The name of the person exempt: 2. The ground of exemption: 3. The name of the person by whose certificate or oath the exemption was proved: and 4. The day when the name was stricken from the list.
