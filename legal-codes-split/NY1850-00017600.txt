Costs may be awarded in favor of one party against another, to be paid personally out of the estate or fund, in any proceedings contested adversely before the surrogate; but such costs cannot exceed those allowed in the supreme court, for a trial in civil actions. Witnesses’ fees, and other disbursements similar to those allowed in the supreme court, may also be allowed.
