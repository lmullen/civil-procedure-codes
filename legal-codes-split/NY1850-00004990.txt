If a person confined on civil process, have been previously admitted to the jail liberties of the county for which the designation is made, he may remain within those liberties, or may be removed to the jail designated, by the sheriff to whom he has given an undertaking for the liberties, in the same cases and in the same manner as the sheriff might legally confine him in the jail of his own county.
