Any corporation mentioned in the last section, may be restrained by injunction from the further exercise of its corporate rights, and from receiving, paying, transferring, or delivering any money or other property, until the court otherwise order; and in that case, a receiver of the corporate property may be appointed. Such injunction may be granted in an action brought by the attorney general, in behalf of the state, to close the business of the corporation, or by a creditor or stockholder, in an action to have such forfeiture adjudged.
