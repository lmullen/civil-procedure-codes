Rights of action, given or secured by existing laws, may be prosecuted in the manner provided by this code. If a case ever arise, in which an action for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong, cannot be had under this code, the practice heretofore in use may be adopted, so far as may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice.
