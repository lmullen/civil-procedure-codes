It may be stipulated in the submission that it be entered as an order of the county court, for which purpose it must be filed with the clerk of the county, where the parties or one of them reside. The clerk must thereupon enter in his register of actions, a note of the submission, with the names of the parties, the names of the arbitrators, the date of the submission, when filed, and the time limited by the submission, if any, within which the award must be made. When so entered, the submission cannot be revoked without the consent of both parties, the arbitrators may be compelled by the court to make an award, and the award may be enforced by the court, in the same manner as a judgment. If the submission be not made an order of the court, it may be revoked at any time before the award is made, or if unrevoked, the award can be enforced by action only.
