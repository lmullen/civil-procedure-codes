Before a party can be entitled to a jury, he must deposit with the justice the sum of three dollars, for jury fees, from which the justice must refund to the party the fees of all jurors who do not attend, and those not refunded must be included in the judgment as part of the costs, in case the party calling the jury recover judgment.
