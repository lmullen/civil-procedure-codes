There is one coroner in the city and county of New-York, and four in every other county of this state, who are elected by the electors of the county, at a general election, once in every three years, and as often as there is a vacancy. The manner of their election and removal, of giving and renewing their official bonds, and of supplying a vacancy in their office, is prescribed by the constitution and by special statutes. Their compensation is prescribed by this code.
