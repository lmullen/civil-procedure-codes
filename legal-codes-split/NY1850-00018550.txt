Upon such motion, the court may make an order, requiring the production and proof of the identity of the person, upon whose life the estate depends, and, in default of his production, may require of the party against whom the application is made, proof of his existence, with satisfactory reasons for his absence. Such evidence may be taken in open court, or by reference, or by commission to another state or county, together with any other evidence, which may be necessary to determine the question of the existence of such person. Such order must then be made declaring the existence or death of the person, as may be in the judgment of the court conformable to the fast. This order is primary evidence of the facts therein determined.
