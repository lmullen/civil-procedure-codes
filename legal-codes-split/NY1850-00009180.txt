When a verdict is rendered, and before it is recorded, the jury may be polled on the request of either party; for which purpose each juror must be asked whether it be his verdict; if any one answer in the negative, the jury must be sent out for further deliberation. If the verdict be informal or insufficient, it may be corrected by the jury under the advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.
