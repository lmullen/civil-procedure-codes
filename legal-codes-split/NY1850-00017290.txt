If, instead of a reconciliation, the terms of which are settled between the parties, they voluntarily submit their matters in difference to the court, and agree to abide the judgment, or assent thereto, in the presence of the court, such submission and agreement, or assent, must be entered in the book of records, and signed by the respective parties; and thereupon the judgment of the court, made pursuant to the submission, shall have the same effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as the judgment mentioned in section 1531.
