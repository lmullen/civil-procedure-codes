Whenever a copy of a writing is certified fair the purpose of evidence, the certificate must state that the copy has been compared by the certifying officer with the original, and is a correct transcript therefrom, and of the whole of such original, or of a specified part thereof. The official seal, if there be any, of the certifying officer, must also be affixed to the certificate, except when the certificate of a clerk of a court is used in the same court or before an officer thereof.
