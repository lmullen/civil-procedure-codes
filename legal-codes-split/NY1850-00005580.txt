A coroner has power, and it is his duty, 1. When he is informed that a person has been killed or dangerously wounded by another, or has suddenly died, under such circumstances as to afford a reasonable ground to suspect that his death has been occasioned by criminal means, or has committed suicide, to inquire by the intervention of a jury, into the cause of the death or wound, and to perform the other duties incidental thereto, in the manner prescribed by the code of criminal procedure: 2. To execute civil process in an action or special proceeding, when the sheriff is a party, as prescribed in sections 482 to 485, both inclusive: 3. To exercise the powers and perform the duties conferred and imposed upon him, by the constitution and by other statutes.
