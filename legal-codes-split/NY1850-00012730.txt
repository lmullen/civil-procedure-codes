Upon a verdict, the justice must immediately render judgment accordingly. When the trial is by the justice, judgment must be entered immediately after the close of the trial, if the defendant has been arrested, or his property attached: in other cases, it must be entered either at the close of the trial, or, if the justice then desire further time to consider, on the fourth day thereafter, both days inclusive.
