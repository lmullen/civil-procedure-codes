In cases where, by the provisions of any statute, a child born after the making of a will, is entitled to succeed to a portion of the testator’s real and personal property, such child shall have the same rights and remedies to compel a distribution of the personal property and a partition of the real property, as are provided for next of kin and for heirs; and shall, in all respects, be liable, in the same manner and to the same extent, to the creditors of his ancestor, in respect to the personal property delivered to him, and the real property descended to him, as are herein prescribed in relation to next of kin and heirs; and such child may recover of the legatees and devisees who may have received or taken any real or personal property of the testator, the share or portion thereof to which he may be entitled.
