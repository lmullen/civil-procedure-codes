Every judge, allowing a writ of deliverance directed to a person other than a sheriff, coroner, constable or marshal, may, in his discretion, require in order to render the service effectual, that the charges of bringing up party, be paid by the applicant; and in such case he must, in the allowance of the writ, specify the amount of such charges, which cannot exceed the fees allowed by law to sheriffs for similar services.
