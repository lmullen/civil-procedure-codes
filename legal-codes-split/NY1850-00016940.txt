If the jury determine, that the road is necessary, it must determine the proper width and location thereof, and the amount of all damage to be sustained by the opening and continued use thereof. The court may thereupon make an order, describing the road, and declaring it a private road for the applicant, and his assigns, and for travel to and from the property, in respect to which it was applied for. A copy of the order must be filed with the records of roads, in the city or town, where the property is situated.
