They must each be worth the amount specified in the order of arrest, exclusive of property exempt from execution, but the judge, or a justice of the peace, on justification, may allow more than two bail to justify severally in amounts less than that expressed in the order, if the whole justification be equivalent to that of two sufficient bail.
