The defendant may, at any time before the trial or judgment, serve upon the plaintifff, an offer to allow judgment to be taken against him, for the sum or property, or to the effect therein specified. If the plaintifff accept the offer, and give notice thereof, within ten days, he may file the summons, complaint and offer, with on affidavit of notice of acceptance, and the clerk must thereupon enter judgment accordingly. If the notice of acceptance be not given, the offer is to be deemed withdrawn, and can not be given in evidence, and if the plaintifff fail to obtain a more favorable judgment, he cannot recover costs, but must pay the defendant’s costs, from the time of the offer.
