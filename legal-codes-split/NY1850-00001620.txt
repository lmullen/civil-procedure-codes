When an indictment is found at a court of oyer and terminer or of sessions, in a county embracing any of the cities in which a city court is established, for an offense not punishable with death, committed in that city, the court in which it was found may send it to the next city court in which it is triable, which must proceed to try and determine the indictment, as if it had been found therein.
