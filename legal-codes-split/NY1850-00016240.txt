After the performance of the work, or the supply of the materials, and the expiration of any credit stipulated for the payment, the lien mentioned in this chapter may be enforced, by an action. In such action, all persons whose liens are registered, as provided in section 1433, may be made parties, and the court may, by the judgment, direct a sale of the land and building for the satisfaction of the liens and costs; such sale to be without prejudice to the rights of any prior encumbrancer, owner or other persons not parties to the action. If several such actions be brought by different claimants, and be pending at the same time, the court may order them to be consolidated into one.
