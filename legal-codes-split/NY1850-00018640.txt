The county court may, except in the cases specified in the next section, remit wholly or partly fines imposed or forfeitures declared by any court in the county, on application and cause shown, and on such terms as may be deemed just. If the fine or forfeiture remitted shall have been paid, the officer in whose hands it may be, must refund the same, or the part thereof remitted, upon an order of the court to that effect.
