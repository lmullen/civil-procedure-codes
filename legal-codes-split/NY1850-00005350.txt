If the action be brought against the sheriff, and he give written notice thereof to the prisoner or to his sureties, a judgment against the sheriff is conclusive evidence of his right to recover against the prisoner or his sureties, as to any matter which was or might have been controverted in the action against the sheriff. In an action by the sheriff against the prisoner or his sureties, the judgment against the sheriff for the escape of the prisoner, is evidence of the damages sustained by him, in the same manner as if it had been collected; and he is also entitled to recover his costs and reasonable expenses in defending the action against him, as part of his damages.
