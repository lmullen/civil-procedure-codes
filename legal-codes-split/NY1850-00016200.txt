The clerk must thereupon register the lien in a book to be kept by him for that purpose, called the “book of liens.” The entries must be arranged alphabetically, under the name, of the owner, and of the street, separately. It must contain the name of the claimant and of the person against whom the claim exists, the amount of the lien, the time when filed, and a brief description of the property. A copy of the statement must be served on the owner, by delivering it to him personally, or by leaving it at his residence with a person of suitable age and discretion, or by depositing it in the post office, directed to him at his place of residence. From the time of filing the statement, and serving the copy, the claimant shall have a lien on the land and building, for the amount then actually due to him for work and materials, or which afterwards becomes due, pursuant to the contract referred to in the statement; but such statement must be made and filed, before the expiration of thirty days after the completion of the work or the supply of the materials.
