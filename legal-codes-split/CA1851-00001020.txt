A defendant arrested may at any time before the justification
of bail apply to the Judge who made the order, or the Court in which
the action is pending, upon reasonable notice to the plaintifff to vacate
the order of arrest, or to reduce the amount of bail. If the application
be made upon adidan'ts, on the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintifff may oppose the same by affidavits or other proofs, in
addition to those on which the order of arrest was made.
