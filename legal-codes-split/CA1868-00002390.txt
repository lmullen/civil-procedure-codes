Costsof partition a lien upon the shares of the parceners.

The costs of partition, including fees of referees and other
disbursements, shall be paid by the parties respectively entitled to share in the lands divided, in proportion to their
respective interests therein, and may be included and specified in the judgment. In that case, they shall be a lien on
the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced by execution against such shares, and against other property held
by the respective parties. When, however, a litigation
arises between some of the parties only, the Court may
require the expense of such litigation to be paid by the parties thereto, or any of them.
