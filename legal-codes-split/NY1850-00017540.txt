There are no pleadings in surrogates’ courts. The proceedings are those prescribed by special statutes in the cases not provided for in this chapter, except that letters of administration and letters testamentary may be known as the appointment of administrators, or executors. Those proceedings are had upon the application of a party, verbal or written; and when verbal, entered in the minutes or otherwise; when written they are filed. The surrogate’s powers are exercised by means of 1. A citation to a party; 2. An affidavit, deposition, or the statement of as party; 3. A subpoena to witness; 4. Orders and judgments; and, 5. An execution or warrant to enforce them.
