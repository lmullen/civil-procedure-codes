The supervisors, or overseers of the poor, of a town, against which, or against whose officers, a judgment has been recovered for a liability of the town, the execution of which has not been stayed upon appeal, must in like manner upon demand, and the delivery of a certified copy of the docket of the judgment, pay the amount due thereon, if there be sufficient money of the town in his hands, not otherwise specifically appropriated. If he fail to do so, he shall be personally responsible for the amount, unless the collection thereof be afterwards stayed upon appeal.
