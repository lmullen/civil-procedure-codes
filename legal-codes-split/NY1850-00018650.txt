Fines imposed on conviction of a public offense or for actual contempt of a court, or for disobedience to its orders or process, can only be remitted by the court by which they were imposed, and that on cause shown, upon notice to the district attorney. An undertaking entered into in one county, for the appearance of a person in another, can only be remitted or discharged by the court, in which such person was bound to appear, or by the county court of that county, after the time designated for such appearance, and then only upon notice to the district attorney and on cause shown.
