At the time and place specified in the notice, the sale may be postponed on the request of any person claiming an interest in the premises, or for want of bidders, by a public announcement of the postponement, and publishing notice thereof; as soon as practicable, in the same newspaper, at the foot of the original notice, specifying the time and place to which the postponement is made, and continuing the notice until the time appointed therein for the sale. It may be again postponed, and from time to time in the same manner, but no costs or fees for making such postponement, or publishing or continuing the notice, can be a charge on the mortgaged property.
