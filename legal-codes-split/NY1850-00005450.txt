The sheriff must receive and keep in the county jail, every prisoner who is committed thereto, under civil process issued by a court of the United States, until he be discharged according to the laws thereof, as if he had been committed under civil process issued under the authority of this state. He may also receive, to his own use, the sum payable by the United States for the use of the jail.
