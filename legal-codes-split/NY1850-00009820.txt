A officer selling without the notice prescribed by the last section, shall forfeit one hundred dollars to the aggrieved party, in addition to his actual damages, and a person, taking down or defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale or the satisfaction of the execution, and without the consent of the parties, shall forfeit fifty dollars; but the validity of the sale is not affected by either act.
