In the supreme court, the superior court of the city of New-York, and the court of common pleas of the city of New-York, an appeal, upon either the law or the fact, may be taken to the general term, from a judgment entered upon the report of the referees or the direction of a single judge of the same court. Security must be given upon such appeal, in the same manner as upon an appeal to the court of appeals. In the supreme court, the appeal must be heard in the same manner as if it were an appeal from an inferior court; but the decision at the general term upon the facts separately from the law, is final.
