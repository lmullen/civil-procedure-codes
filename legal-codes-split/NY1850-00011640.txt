In actions brought against several heirs jointly, or several devisees jointly, the amount, which the plaintifff recovers, must be apportioned, among all the heirs of the ancestor, or among all the devisees of the testator, in proportion to the value of the real property descended or devised, and such proportion only can be recovered of each heir or legatee.
