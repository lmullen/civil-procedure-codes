When a vessel has lain twenty-four hours at a wharf in this state, for which wharfage is due, and the same has been demanded of the master or owner, by notice left on board with one of the company of the vessel, and neither payment is made nor security given thereforee, the owner of the wharf may distrain any chattels on board the vessel for the amount; and so, from time to time as often as twenty-four hour’s wharfage becomes due. The distress must be made by a constable or marshal.
