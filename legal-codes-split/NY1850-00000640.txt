The judges must also at all reasonable times, when not engaged in holding court, transact such other business as may be done out of court. One of the judges elected in the first judicial district, to be designated from time to time, among themselves, must attend for that purpose at the city hall in the city of New-York, on every judicial day, from ten o’clock in the forenoon until three o’ clock in the afternoon, and longer, if the business require it; and every proceeding commenced before one of those judges, may be continued before another, with the same effect as if commenced before him.
