If it appear that the real property so descended, was not aliened by the heir, at the time of the commencement of the action, or if the heir confess the claim, and show what real property has descended to him, the court must order that the debt of the plaintifff, or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover, be levied of the real property so descended, and not otherwise; and every judgment rendered in such action has preference, as a lien on the real property descended, to any judgment obtained against such heir personally, for a debt or demand in his own right.
