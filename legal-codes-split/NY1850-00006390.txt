If the coroner be arrested on process in an action in which the sheriff is plaintifff, or if another person be so arrested in an action in which both the coroner and sheriff are plaintifffs, he must be committed to the county jail, when his commitment is required by this code: but the persons making the arrest are not liable for his escape from the jail, after he is committed thereto.
