An attorney and counsellor may, at any time, file in the office of the clerk of the county in which he resides, a written resignation; and after the filing thereof, he is not entitled to the rights, nor is he subject to the disabilities or prohibitions incident to that relation; except that he is still subject to the power of the court, as provided in the last three sections, in respect to matters arising while he was an attorney and counsellor.
