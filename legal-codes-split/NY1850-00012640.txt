The ballots containing names of jurors not summoned, if any, and of those summoned, but not drawn, must be returned by the justice to the drawn jury box, except that such of them as contain the names of persons, not liable to serve as jurors, must be destroyed. The ballots containing the names of the jurors, who serve, must not be returned to the same box from which they were taken, until all the names have been drawn out. As often as that happens, the whole number must be returned to the undrawn jury box, to be drawn as in the first instance.
