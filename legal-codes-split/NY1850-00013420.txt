An undertaking upon an appeal is of no effect, unless it be accompanied by the affidavit of the sureties, that they are each worth double the amount specified therein. The adverse party may, however, except to the sufficiency of the sureties, within ten days after notice of the appeal; and unless they or other sureties justify before a judge of the court below, or a county judge as prescribed by sections 691 and 692, within ten days thereafter, the appeal must be regarded as if no such undertaking had been given. The justification must be upon a notice of not less than five days.
