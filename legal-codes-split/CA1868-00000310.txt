Oross demands.

When cross demands have existed between persons, under
such circumstances, that if one had brought an action against
the other, a counterclaim could have been set up, neither
shall be deprived of the benefit thereof, by the assignment or
death of the other; but the two demands [shall] be deemed
compensated, so far as they equal each other.
