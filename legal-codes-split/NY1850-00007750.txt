In an action for libel or slander, it is not necessary to state in the complaint, any extrinsic facts, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintifff, of the defamatory matter out of which the cause of action arose; but it is sufficient to state generally, that the same was published or spoken concerning the plaintifff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintifff must establish, on the trial, that it was so published or spoken.
