The seal affixed to a writing is presumptive evidence of a consideration. In other respects there is no difference between sealed and unsealed writings, except as to the time of commencing actions thereon. A writing under seal may thereforeee be changed, or altogether discharged, by a writing not under seal, or by an oral agreement otherwise valid.
