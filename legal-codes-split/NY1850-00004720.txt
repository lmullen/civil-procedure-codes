The sheriff, immediately after entering upon his office, must appoint an under sheriff, to hold during his pleasure: and must make a similar appointment, as often as a vacancy occurs in the office of under sheriff. He may also appoint as many deputies as he thinks proper; and may grant a special written authority to any other person to do a particular act.
