No other pleading or written allegation'is allowed,
than the writ and answer. These are the pleadings in the
case, and have the same effect and are to be construed and
may be amended in the same manner, as pleadings in a civil
action; and the issues thereby joined, must be tried and the
further proceedings thereon had in the same manner, as in
a civil action.
