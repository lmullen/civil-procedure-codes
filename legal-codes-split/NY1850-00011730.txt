When a public officer, by official misconduct or neglect of duty, forfeits his official bond, or renders his sureties liable upon an official security, any person, injured thereby, or who is, by law, entitled to the benefit of the security, may bring an action thereon, in his own name, against the officer and his sureties, to recover the amount to which he may be entitled, by reason of the delinquency.
