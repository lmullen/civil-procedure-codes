The jurisdiction conferred upon the police courts, by the last section, can, however, be exercised only in the following cases: 1. When the party charged, upon his being brought before a magistrate, requests to be tried by a police court: or, 2. When, not having made such request, and after having been required by the magistrate to give bail for his appearance at the next court of sessions in the county, he omits to do so for twenty-four hours.
