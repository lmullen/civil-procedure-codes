The referees, so appointed, must execute their duties as follows: 1. They must admeasure and lay off, as speedily as possible, the one-third part of the real property, embraced in the order for their appointment, as the dower of such widow, designating such part by posts, stones, or other permanent monuments; 2. In making such admeasurement, they must take into view, any permanent improvement made upon the property embraced in the order, by any heir, guardian of a minor, or other owner, since the death of the husband, or since the alienation thereof by him; and, if practicable, must award such improvements within that part of the property not allotted to the widow; and if not practicable so to award the same, they must make a deduction from the property allotted to the widow, proportionate to the benefit she will derive from such part of the improvements, as may be included in the portion assigned to her; 3. They must make a full report of their proceedings, with the quantity, and description of the property, admeasured and allotted by them to the widow, mentioning the posts, stones, and other permanent monuments thereof, and the items of their charges, to the court by which they were appointed, at the time specified in the order for their appointment; 4. They may employ a surveyor, with necessary assistants, to aid them in such admeasurement.
