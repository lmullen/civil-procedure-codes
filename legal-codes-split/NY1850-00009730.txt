Where the execution is against the property of the judgment debtor, it may be issued to the sheriff of any county where the judgment is docketed. Where it requires the delivery of real or personal property, it must be issued to the sheriff of the county where the property or some part thereof, is situated. Executions may be issued, at the same time, to different counties.
