When the person arrested is brought before the justice, or when a person in attendance refuses to serve as a juror or to testify as a witness, and no valid excuse be shown, the justice may impose a fine upon him, not exceeding five dollars. An entry of such fine, stating the reason thereof, must be made by the justice in his docket, and thereupon shall have the effect of a judgment, in favor of the overseers of the poor of the town against the delinquent, and may be enforced as well against his person as his property.
