The costs of partition, including fees of referees and other disbursements, must be paid by the parties respectively entitled to share in the lands divided, in proportion to their respective interests therein, and may be included and specified in the judgment. In that case, they are a lien on the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced by execution against the parties separately. Where, however, a litigation arises between some of the parties only the court may require, the expense of such litigation to be paid by the parties thereto, or any of them.
