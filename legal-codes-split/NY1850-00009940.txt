When an execution against property of the judgment debtor, or of any one of several debtors, in the same judgment, issued to the sheriff of the county where he resides, or if he do not reside in this state, to the sheriff of the county where the judgment roll, or a transcript of a justice’s judgment, is filed, is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, the judgment creditor, at any time after such return made, is entitled to an order from a judge of the court, or a county judge of the county to which the execution was issued, requiring such judgment debtor to appear and answer, concerning his property, before such judge, or a referee appointed by a judge of the court, at a time and place specified in the order.
