A last will and testament, except when made by a soldier in actual military service, or by a marine at sea, is invalid, unless it be in writing, and executed with such formalities as are required by law. Evidence, thereforee, of such will cannot be received without the written instrument itself, or secondary evidence of its contents, in the cases prescribed by law.
