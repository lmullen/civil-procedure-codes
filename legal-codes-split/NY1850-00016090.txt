A warrant of removal can only be executed in the day time. The officer must execute it, by removing the defendant and any other person occupying by his permission, any part of the property, as his tenant or otherwise, and putting the plaintifff into possession. But when the premises are underlet, the under-tenant can not be removed, unless the summons has either been served upon him or posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
