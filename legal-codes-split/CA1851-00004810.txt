If a trial he had between the persons named in the affidavit i
as parties expectant, or their successors in interest, upon proof of the death i
or insanity of the witness, or of his inability to attend the trial by
reason of age, sickness, or settled infirmity, the deposition or a certified
copy thereof may be used by either party subject to all legal objections.
But if the parties attend at the examination no objection to the form of
an interrogatory shall be made at the trial, unless the same was stated
at the time of the examination.
