Of the parties to the action, those who are united in interest must be joined as plaintifffs or defendants; but if the consent of any one, who should have been joined as plaintifff, cannot be obtained, he may be made a defendant, the reason thereof being stated in the complaint: and when the question is one of a common or general interest of many persons, or when the parties are numerous and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.
