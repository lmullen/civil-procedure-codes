When dower is admeasured pursuant to the provisions of this title, and the right to dower is disputed, if in an action brought by the widow to recover possession, she fail to establish her right, the share of the costs on admeasurement, which may have been paid by the other party, may be added to the costs of the defense in such action; and if the dower be withheld from her and she fail for two years to bring an action for the recovery thereof, she shall be liable in an action to the other party for the expenses of admeasurement paid by him.
