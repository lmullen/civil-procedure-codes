Either party may attend such examination and put such questions, direct and cross, as may be proper. The deposition, when completed, shall be carefully read to the witness and corrected by him in
any particular, if desired; it shall then be subscribed by the witness,
certified by the Judge or officer taking the deposition, inclosed in an
envelope or wrapper sealed, and directed to the Clerk of the Court in
which the action is pending, or to such person as the parties in writing
mayagree upon, and either delivered by the Judge or officer to the Clerk
or such person, or transmitted through the mail, or by some safe private
opportunity ; and thereupon such deposition may be used by either
party upon the trial, or other proceeding, against any party giving or
receiving the notice, subject to all legal exceptions. But if the parties
attend at the examination, no objection to the form of an interrogatory
shall be made at the trial, unless the same was stated at the time of the
examination. If the deposition be taken by the reason of the absence
or intended absence from the county of the witness, or because he is-too
infirm to attend, proof by affidavit or oral testimony shall be made at
the trial that the witness continues absent, or infirm, to the best of the
deponent’s knowledge or belief. The deposition thus taken may be also
read in case of the death of the witness.
