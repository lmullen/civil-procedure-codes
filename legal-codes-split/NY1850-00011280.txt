Whenever the affairs of a corporation are closed by the supreme court, (except on a judgment, obtained by a creditor for the satisfaction of a debt,) the creditors are entitled to be paid ratably in proportion to the amount of their respective demands, as ascertained under the direction of the court, except, that, in case of the insolvency of a bank or banking association, the bill holders thereof are entitled to preference in payment over other creditors.
