When there is a surplus, arising on the sale, beyond the amount due, with costs, and there remains a sum, secured by the mortgage, yet to become due, the holder of the mortgage is entitled to receive such surplus, to be applied to the amount next to become due, the proper rebate of interest being made. If he refuse to receive the surplus, it may, by order of the judge be paid to the person next entitled.
