When it is admitted, by the pleading or examination of a
party, that he has in his possession, or under his control, any money, or
other thing, capable of delivery, which, being the subfect of the litigation,
is held by him as trustee for another party, or which belongs, or is due,
to another party, the Court may order the same, upon motion, to be
deposited in Court, or delivered to such party, upon such conditions as
may be just, subject to the further direction of the Court.
