A defendant shall be deemed to appear in an action when he
answers, demurs, or gives the plaintifff written notice of his appearance, or
when an attorney gives notice of appearance for him. After appearance,
a defendant or his attorney shall be entitled to notice of all subsequent
proceedings of which notice is required to be given. But where a defendant has not appeared, service of notice or papers need not be made upon
him, unless he imprisoned for want of bail.
