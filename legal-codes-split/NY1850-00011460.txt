That any property has been omitted in such inventory, or was not returned therein at its full value: 2. That such property has perished or been lost, without the fault of such executors or administrators; or that it has been fairly sold by them at private public sale, at a less price than the value so returned; or that, since the return of the inventory, such property has deteriorated or increased in value. In such action. the defendants cannot be charged for any things in action, specified in their inventory, unless it appear that they have been collected, or might with due diligence, have been collected.
