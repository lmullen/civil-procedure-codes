A copy of the judgment, signed by the Clerk, entered upon,
or attached to, the writ and return, shall constitute the judgment roll. If
the proceeding be had in any other than the Supreme Court, an appeal
may be taken from the judgment in the same manner, and upon the
same terms, as from a judgment in a civil action.
