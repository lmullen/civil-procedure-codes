There are three kinds of writs of execution; one against the property of the judgment debtor; another against his person; and the third for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, or such delivery with damages for withholding the same. They are issued in the name of the people and are deemed the process of the court, but they need not be sealed nor subscribed, except as prescribed in the next section.
