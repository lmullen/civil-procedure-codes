But an officer is not so liable, unless the person claiming exemption make, if required, an affidavit, stating: 1. That he has been served with a subpoena, to attend as a witness before a court, officer, or other person, specifying the same, the place of attendance, and the action or proceeding in which the subpoena was issued, and: 2. That he has not been thus served by his own procurement, with the intention of avoiding an arrest. The affidavit may be taken by the officer, and exonerates him from liability for not making the arrest or for discharging the witness when arrested.
