Any person, interested in the assessment, may make himself a party to the proceedings, by giving to the commissioners written notice of his wish to be made a party, stating his name and address; and thereafter is entitled to at least six days notice of the meeting of the commissioners, of the time of presenting their report, and of the sale, if any. The notice must be served by delivering it to him personally, or sending the same through the post office to his address; except that when a party comes in after notice already given to the existing parties, a new notice to him is not necessary. But the failure to give the notice required by this section, does not affect the jurisdiction of the court.
