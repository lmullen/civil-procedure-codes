Service of a paper upon the sheriff, may be made by delivering it to a person belonging to and in the office during office hours, or if no such person be there, by leaving it in the office. If, however, no notice of the place of keeping his office be filed, the service may be made at the county clerk’s office, upon the county clerk or his deputy. The service in the cases provided in this section is equivalent to a personal service on the sheriff.
