Whenever the governor of this state is authorized by law to take possession of real property, within this state, for the use of the people of the state, and he cannot agree with the owner for the purchase thereof, he must cause application to be made for a writ of assessment, which shall thereupon be issued to the sheriff of the county, where such real property is situated, unless the court direct such damages to be assessed by a jury of another county, commanding him to summon a jury to inquire whether the owners of the property, describing it, will sustain any, and what damage, by the taking of the property for the use of the state.
