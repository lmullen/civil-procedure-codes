The supervisors of a county in which a term of the court of appeals, or a term or circuit of the supreme court, or a term of a court of oyer and terminer or sessions, or county court, is appointed to be held, must provide the court with rooms, furniture, attendants, fuel, lights and stationery, suitable and sufficient for the transaction of its business, and for the jury attending upon it. The common council of the city in which a term of a city court, and in the city of New-York, a term of the superior court or court of common pleas of that city, is appointed to be held, must make for those courts the same provision.
