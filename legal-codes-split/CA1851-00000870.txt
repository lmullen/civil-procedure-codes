For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the bail at any
time or place before they are finally charged, may themselves arrest
him; or by a written authority, endorsed on a certified copy of the undertaking, may empower the Sheriff to do so. Upon the arrest of the
defendant by the Sheriff, or upon his delivery to the Sheriff by the bail,
or upon his own surrender, the bail shall be exonerated: Provided, Such
arrest, delivery, or surrender, take place before the expiration of ten
days after judgment; but if such arrest, delivery, or surrender, be not
made within ten days after judgment, the bail shall be finally charged on

their undertaking, and be bound to pay the amount of the judgment,
within ten days thereafter.
