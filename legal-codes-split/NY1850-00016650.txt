When the warrant contains the direction to let the person arrested to bail, he must be discharged from the arrest, upon executing and delivering to the officer, at any time before the return day of the warrant, a written undertaking, with two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the person arrested will appear on the return of the warrant, and abide the order of the court or officer thereupon, or pay, as may be directed, the sum specified in the warrant.
