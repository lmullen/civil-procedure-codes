The law of evidence, which is the subject of this part of the code, is a collection of general rules established by law, 1. For declaring what is to be taken as true, without proof: 2. For declaring the presumptions of law, both those which are disputable and those which are conclusive; and 3. For the production of legal evidence: 4. For the exclusion of whatever is not legal: 5. For determining in certain cases the value and effect of evidence.
