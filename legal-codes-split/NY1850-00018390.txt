The real property and leasehold estate of an infant, may be sold or mortgaged under the direction of the supreme court, or the county court of the county in a special proceeding, on the application in writing of the general guardian or some person next of kin of the infant, for him, in either of the following cases: 1. When the sale or mortgage is necessary for the infant’s support or education: 2. When the interest of the infant will be promoted by it, by reason of the unproductiveness of the property or its being exposed to waste or for any other peculiar circumstances. But such sale or mortgage can in no case be made contrary to the provisions of the will or conveyance by which the property was devised or granted to the infant. The application must state the grounds thereforee and must be verified as a complaint in an action.
