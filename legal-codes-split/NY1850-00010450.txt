An action for the recovery of real property against a person in possession, or in the receipt of the rents or profits thereof, can not be prejudiced by any alienation, made by such person, either before or after the commencement of the action; but in such case, if the defendant have no property sufficient to satisfy the damages recovered, for the Withholding of possession, such damages may be collected by action against the purchaser.
