At any time prior to the sale, any person having an interest or lien upon the property, subsequent to the mortgage, may assume the same, by paying to the holder the amount secured and interest, with the costs already incurred, together with the amount of any lien of the same holder subsequent to the mortgage, and prior to that of the person offering to assume it; and he shall thereupon be entitled to an assignment of the mortgage and of such subsequent lien, and may proceed in the foreclosure or discontinue it, at his option.
