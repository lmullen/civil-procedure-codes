When the property of the corporation is insufficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel each stockholder to pay any amount, that may remain unpaid, on the shares of stock held by him, or so much thereof, as is necessary to satisfy the debts, and when the officers or stockholders are personally liable for the debts, and the property of the corporation, together with the amount unpaid on the stock, is insufficient to discharge its debts, the court may compel contribution from the officers or stockholders, who may be liable to satisfy the balance of the debts, from each according to his liability.
