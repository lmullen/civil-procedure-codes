Where no provision is made by special statute, as to security upon an injunction, the court or judge must require a written undertaking, on the part of the plaintifff, with or without sureties, to the effect that the plaintifff will pay to the party enjoined, such damages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, as he may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court, finally decide that the plaintifff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference, or otherwise, as the court may direct.
