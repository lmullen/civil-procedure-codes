If the plaintifff fail to appear at the return day of the summons and make his complaint, the action must be dismissed. If the defendant fail to appear at the return day of the summons, or if either party fail, to attend at a day to which the trial has been adjourned, or fail to make the necessary pleading or proof on his part, the case may nevertheless proceed at the request of the adverse party; and judgment must be given in conformity with the pleadings and proofs.
