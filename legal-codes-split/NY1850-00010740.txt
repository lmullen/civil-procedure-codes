If it be alleged in the complaint, and established by evidence, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property or any part of it is so situated, that partition cannot be made, without great prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof, and for that purpose may appoint one or more referees. Otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, it must order a partition, according to the respective rights of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint three referees thereforee; and must designate the portion to remain undivided, for the owners, whose interests remain unknown or not ascertained.
