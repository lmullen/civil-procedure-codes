In all cases of the verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the
party shall state that the same is true of his own knowledge, except as
to the matters which are therein stated on his information or belief, and as
to those matters, that he believes it.to be true. And where a pleading
is verified, it shall be by the affidavit of the party, unless he be absent
from the county where the Attorney resides, or from some cause unable
to verify it, or the facts are within the knowledge of his Attorney, or
other person verifying the same. When the pleading is verified by the
Attorney, or any other person except the party, he shall set forth in the
affidavit the reasons why it is not made by the party. When a corporation is a party, the verification may be made by any ofIicer thereof; or
when the State, or any oilicer thereof in its behalf, is a party, the verification may be made by any person acquainted with the facts, except that

in actions prosecuted by the Attorney General in behalf of the State
the pleadings need not, in any case, be verified.
