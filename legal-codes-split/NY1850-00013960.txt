Motions must be made within the district in which the action is triable, or in a county adjoining that in which it is triable, except that where the action is triable in the first judicial district, the motion must be made therein. Orders made out of court, without notice, may be made by any judge of the court, in any part of the state; and if the action be in the supreme court they may also be made by a county judge of the county where the action is triable, except to stay proceedings after a verdict. No order to stay proceedings for a longer time than twenty days, can be granted by a judge out of court, except upon previous notice to the adverse party.
