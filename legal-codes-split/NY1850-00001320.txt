In case of the inability of the surrogate, or of a vacancy in his office, the court must be held by the county judge, or if he be unable to act, or his office be vacant, by the special county judge, in a county where there is such an officer. If there be no county judge or special county judge, or he be unable to act, it must be held by the district attorney.
