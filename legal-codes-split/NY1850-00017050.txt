If the court be satisfied that the corporation is insolvent, or that for any other reason, the dissolution thereof will be beneficial to the stockholders, and not injurious to the public, an order of dissolution may be made, and a receiver appointed. Such corporation shall thereby cease to exist, and its property shall be applied in satisfaction of its debts, and in discharge of its liabilities, and the residue distributed among the stockholders, according to their respective interests therein. No action or special proceeding shall abate by such dissolution, but the receiver may, on motion, be substituted therein, for the corporation.
