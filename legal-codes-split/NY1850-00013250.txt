An appeal must be made by the service of a notice in writing, on the adverse party, and on the clerk with whom the judgment or order appealed from is entered stating the appeal from the same, or some specified part thereof. When a party gives, in good faith, notice of appeal from a judgment or order, and omits, through mistake, to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings, the court may permit an amendment on such terms as may be just.
