An attorney and counsellor has authority. 1. To bind his client, in any of the proceedings in an action or special proceeding, by his agreement filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes of the court, and not otherwise: 2. To receive money claimed by his client in an action or special proceeding, during the pendency thereof or within one year after judgment; and upon the payment thereof, and not otherwise, to discharge the claim, or acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment. But this section does not prevent a party from employing a new attorney, to issue an execution upon a judgment, or to take the other proceedings, prescribed by this code, for its enforcement; and when he does so, the authority of the former attorney ceases.
