A Justice may, at the request of a party, and on being satisfied that it is expedient, specially depute any discreet person of suitable
age, and not interested in the action, to serve a summons or execution
with or without an order to arrest the defendant, or with or without a
writ of attachment. Such deputation shall be in writing on the
process.
