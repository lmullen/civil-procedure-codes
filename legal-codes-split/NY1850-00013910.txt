The court before which an action is pending, or a judge thereof, or if the action be in the supreme court, a county judge may order either party to give to the other, within a specified time, an inspection and copy, or permission to take a copy of any book, document or paper in his possession, or under his control, containing evidence relating to the merits of the action, or the defense therein. If compliance with the order be refused, the court may exclude the book, document or paper from being given in evidence, or if wanted as evidence by the party applying, may direct the jury to presume it to be such as he alleges it to be; and the court may also punish the party refusing. This section is not to be construed to prevent a party from compelling another to produce books, papers, or documents, when he is examined as a witness.
