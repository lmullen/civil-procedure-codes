If a sufficient answer be presented, the judge must endorse on the complaint an order that, within five days, the same be filed with the answer, and any reply that the plaintifff may desire to make to any counterclaim in the answer, and that the issue thus joined be forthwith placed upon the calendar for trial, if a circuit or term of the court be then in session, or if not, then at the next session thereof. Upon the filing of the pleadings, the proceeding becomes an action pending in the court, to be tried, without further notice, and all subsequent proceedings therein must be the same as in other actions.
