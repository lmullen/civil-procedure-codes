The conviction, specifying particularly the offense and the judgment thereon, must be entered by the justice in his docket. A warrant of commitment to the jail of the county until the fine be paid, or for the term of the imprisonment, may then be issued. Such warrant must contain a transcript of the entry in the docket; and the same must be executed by any constable to whom it may be given, and by the jailer of the county.
