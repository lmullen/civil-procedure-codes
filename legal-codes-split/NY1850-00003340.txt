Every person must, upon the application of the commissioner of jurors, or any of his assistants, give correct information of his knowledge or belief of the liability of a person to serve as a juror. For his refusal to do so, or his willfully giving incorrect information in respect thereto, he is liable to a penalty of fifty dollars, recoverable in a civil action by the corporation of the city of New-York.
