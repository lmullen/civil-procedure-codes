A sheriff or jailer, upon whom a paper in a judicial proceeding, directed to a prisoner in his custody, is served, must forthwith deliver it to the prisoner, with a note thereon of the time of its service. For a neglect to do so, he is liable to the prisoner for all damages occasioned thereby; and by a willful omission in this respect, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
