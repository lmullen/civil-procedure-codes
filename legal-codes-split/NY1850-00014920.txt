The writ must not be disobeyed for any defect of form. It is sufficient, 1. If the person, having the custody of the party imprisoned or restrained, be designated either by his name of office, if he have any, or by his own name, or if both such names be unknown or uncertain, he may be described by an assumed appellation; and any one who may be served with the writ, is to be deemed the person to whom it was directed, although it may be directed to him by a wrong name or description, or to another person; 2. If the person, who is directed to be produced, be designated by name, or if his name be uncertain or unknown, he may be described in any other way, so as to designate the person intended.
