When a plaintifff or a defendant who has appeared resides
out of the State, and has no attorney in the action or proceeding, the
service may be made on the Clerk for him. But in all cases where a
party has no attorney in the action or proceeding, the service of papers,

when required, shall be upon the attorney instead of the party, except
of subpoenas, of writs, and other process issued in the suit, and of
papers to bring him into contempt.
