The defendant's sureties, upon notice to the plaintifff of not less than two nor more than six days, must justify before a judge or justice of the peace, in the same manner as upon bail on arrest; and upon such justification, the sheriff must deliver the property to the defendant. The sheriff shall be responsible for the defendant’s sureties, until they justify, or until the justification is completed or expressly waived, and may retain the property until that time, but if they or others in their place, fail to justify, at the time and place appointed, he must deliver the property to the plaintifff.
