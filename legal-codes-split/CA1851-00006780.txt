From a judgment in a civil action in a Recorder’s or Mayor’s
Court, an appeal may be taken to the County Court. The appeal shall
be taken and the proceedings thereon conducted in the same manner as
appeals are taken from a judgment in a civil action in a Justice’s Court,
and as the proceedings thereon are conducted.
