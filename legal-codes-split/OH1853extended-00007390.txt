When a guardian to the suit is necessary, he must
be appointed by the justice, as follows:

1. If the infant be plaintifff, the appointment must be
made before the summons is issued, upon the application of
the infant if he be of the age of fourteen years or upwards;
if under that age, upon the application of some friend.

The consent in writing of the guardian to be appointed,
and to be responsible for costs if he fail in the action, must
be filed with the justice.

2. If the infant be defendant, the guardian must be
appointed before the trial. It is the right of the infant to
nominate his own guardian if the infant be over fourteen
years of age and the proposed guardian be present and consent in writing to be appointed. Otherwise the justice may
appoint any suitable person who gives such consent.
