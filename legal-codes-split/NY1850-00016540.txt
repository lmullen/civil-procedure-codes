When an officer is authorized by statute to distrain property for any purpose whatever, and no special provision is otherwise made, he must give at least six days’ notice of the sale of the property, by posting the same in three public places of the town where the sale is to be made; and he must, also, before making the sale, require three disinterested freeholders of the town to appraise the property distrained, and they must thereupon make the appraisal on oath, and certify it, with an inventory of the property.
