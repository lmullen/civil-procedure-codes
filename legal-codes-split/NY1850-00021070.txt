Every answer or declaration of the witness must be taken down, unless the parties otherwise agree. The deposition, when completed, must be carefully read to, and subscribed by, the witness, then certified by the judge, and immediately thereafter filed in the office of the clerk of the county where it was taken, together with the order for the examination of the witness, the affidavit on which the same was granted, and the affidavit of service of the affidavit, order, and notice.
