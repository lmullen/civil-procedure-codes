When judgment is rendered upon the appeal, it shall be certified by the Clerk of the Supreme Court to the Clerk with whom
the judgment roll is filed, or the order appealed from is entered. In
cases of appeal from the judgment, the Clerk with whom the roll is filed
shall attach the certificate to the judgment roll, and enter a minute of
the judgment of the Supreme Court on the docket against the original
entry. In cases of appeal from an order, the Clerk shall enter at length
in the records of the Court the certificate received, and minute against
the entry of the order appealed from a reference to the certificate, with
a brief statement that such order has been adirmed, reversed, or modi—
fied, as the case may be, by the Supreme Court, on appeal.
