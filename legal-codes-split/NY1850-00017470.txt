The county court, on motion, may vacate the award, upon either of the following grounds, and may order a new hearing before the same arbitrators, or not in its discretion: 1. That it was procured by corruption or fraud: 2. That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct, or committed gross error in refusing, on cause shown, to postpone the hearing, or in refusing to hear pertinent evidence, or otherwise acted improperly in a manner by which the rights of the party were prejudiced: 3. That the arbitrators exceeded their powers in making their award, or that they refused, or improperly omitted to consider a part of the matters submitted to them, or that the award is indefinite, or cannot be performed. The court may, on motion, modify or correct the award, where it appears: 1. That there was a miscalculation in figures, upon which it was made, or that there is a mistake in the description of some person or property therein: 2. When a part of the award is upon matters not submitted, which part can be separated from other parts, and does not affect the decision on the matters submitted: 3. When the award is imperfect in form, and if it had been a verdict could have been amended, or those imperfections disregarded.
