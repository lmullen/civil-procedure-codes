A warrant of arrest may be issued by such justice, on which the person so guilty may be arrested, and brought before the justice, on the same day, or the next judicial day, when an opportunity to be heard in his defense or excuse must be given. The justice may thereupon discharge him, or may convict him of the offense, and adjudge a punishment by fine or imprisonment, or both; such fine not to exceed twenty dollars, and such imprisonment, ten days.
