Upon the defendant’s making such an answer, or if he have been arrested, upon such answer and undertaking, the justice must enter an order in his docket transferring the action to the supreme court; and the proceedings must thenceforth be conducted in that court, in all respects as if the action had been first commenced therein; and costs shall there be given without regard to the amount recovered; the costs before the justice being added as disbursements. The plaintifff may, however, by a notice served within twenty days thereafter, decline to prosecute his action in the supreme court; in such case, the claim shall be deemed abandoned, and no costs shall be recovered against him in the supreme court.
