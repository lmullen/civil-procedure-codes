In an action arising on contract, notwithstanding an appeal and security given for a stay of proceedings thereon, if the respondent give adequate security to make restitution, in case the judgment is reversed or modified, he may, upon leave obtained from the court below, proceed to enforce the judgment. Such security must be an undertaking, executed to the appellant, by at least two sufficient sureties, to the effect, that if the judgment be reversed or modified, the respondent will make such restitution as the appellate court may direct.
