Upon the return day, if a jury be required, or if the justice be actually engaged in other official business, he may adjourn the trial without the consent of either party, as follows: 1. Where a party, who is not a resident of the county, is in attendance; or where the defendant is in attendance under arrest; the adjournment not to exceed twenty-four hours; and the defendant, if under arrest, to continue in custody: 2. In other cases, not to exceed five days, unless by consent of parties. If the trial be not adjourned, it must take place immediately upon the return of the summons.
