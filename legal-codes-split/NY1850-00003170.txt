The court to which the panel of grand jurors is returned by the sheriff, may impose a fine not exceeding twenty-five dollars, for each day a grand juror without reasonable cause, neglects to attend. If, however, the notice to attend were not personally served, the fine cannot be imposed, until, upon an order to show cause, an opportunity is afforded him to be heard.
