If it appear in an action against a surety, on an official security, that he has already been obliged, by reason of prior recoveries against him on the same, to pay amounts, which, in the aggregate, are equal to the extent of his undertaking, or that, by reason of the insolvency of his principal, he will be obliged to pay to that extent on judgments already recovered against the surety. And the recovery against a surety must, in all cases, be limited by the amount of his undertaking.
