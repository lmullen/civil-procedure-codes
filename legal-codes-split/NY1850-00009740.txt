If the action be one in which the defendant might have been arrested, as provided in the first three subdivisions of section 675, an execution against the person of the judgment debtor may be issued to any county within the jurisdiction of the court, after the return of an execution against his property, unsatisfied in whole or in part. An execution against the person may likewise be issued, after such return, in the cases mentioned in the fourth and fifth subdivisions of that section, where the defendant has been provisionally arrested in the action, and the order for his arrest has not been vacated, or upon an order of arrest obtained in the same manner as for a provisional arrest.
