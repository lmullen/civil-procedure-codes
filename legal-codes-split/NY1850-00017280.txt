If the parties agree to a judgment, in favor of one against the other, in settlement of their differences, the judge may make, at the foot of the entry of reconciliation, a memorandum stating the judgment agreed upon. A transcript of such memorandum, certified by the judge, may be filed in the office of the county clerk, and shall thereupon have the same effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as the judgment of a county court.
