When the case is reserved for argument or further consideration, as mentioned in the last section, on the ground that judgment ought not to be given in conformity to the verdict, or that it is doubtful what judgment should be given, the questions reserved may be decided by the court, and judgment thereupon rendered without further argument, or if not so decided they may be brought before the court for judgment, at a special term, upon notice; and judgment thereupon rendered.
