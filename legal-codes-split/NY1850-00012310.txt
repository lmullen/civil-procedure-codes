Before an order to attach property can be made, the plaintifff must prove to the satisfaction of the justice, by the affidavit of himself, or another person, the facts on which the application is founded; he must also prove in the same manner, the amount, as near as may be, of his debt or claim, over all payments and set offs. He must also execute, and deliver to the justice, a written undertaking approved by him, with sufficient sureties, to the effect that he will pay to the defendant, all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the plaintifff fail to recover judgment; and that if judgment be recovered, the plaintifff will restore so much of the property, or the avails thereof, if any, as may remain after satisfying the judgment and the subsequent costs.
