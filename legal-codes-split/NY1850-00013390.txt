Whenever an appeal is perfected, as provided by sections 1175, 1176, 1177 and 1178, it stays all further proceedings in the court below, upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter embraced therein; but he court below may proceed upon any other matter included in the action, and not affected by the judgment appealed from. And the court below may, in its discretion, dispense with, or limit, the security required by sections 1175, 1176, and 1178, when the appellant is an executor, administrator, trustee, or other person acting in another’s right; and may also in all cases limit such security to an amount not less than fifty thousand dollars.
