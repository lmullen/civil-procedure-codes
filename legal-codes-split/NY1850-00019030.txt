When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the‘ parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms, and thereforee there can be, between the parties and their representatives, or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of the agreement, other than the contents of the writing, except in the following cases: 1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings: 2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute. But this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made, or to which it relates, as defined in section 1693, or to explain an ambiguity, intrinsic or extrinsic, or to establish illegality or fraud. The term agreement includes deeds and wills, as well as contracts between parties.
