A prisoner committed to the county jail for a contempt, or for trial or upon conviction for a public offense, or in default of security to appear as a witness in a criminal action, must be actually confined in the jail, until he is legally discharged; and if he be permitted to go at large out of the jail, except by virtue of a legal order or process, it is an escape, and the sheriff or jailer permitting it is punishable for a misdemeanor; and when the prisoner escaping is also held until he pay a sum of money to a private party, that party may recover, in a civil action against the sheriff, his damages sustained by reason of the escape.
