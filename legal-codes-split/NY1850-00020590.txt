Either party may attend on such examination, and put such questions, direct and cross, as may be proper, or if either party by written notice to the other, six days before the examination, require it, it must be taken upon written interrogatories. The deposition must be taken, certified to the court, and filed with the clerk in the same manner, as a deposition upon commission.
