At the time and place specified, or at another time and place to which the hearing may be then adjourned, the court must hear the allegations and evidence of the applicant, and of any other party interested. The original application and schedules may be used on the hearing, adjournments may be had, and testimony taken, from time to time, in the discretion of the court, and if it become necessary to take an account, a reference for that purpose may be ordered.
