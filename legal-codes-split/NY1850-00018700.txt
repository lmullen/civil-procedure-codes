In special proceedings where the costs are not by this code defined, the court may, in its discretion, require costs to be paid by any party to another, or to be paid from the fund which is the subject of the proceeding. The costs allowed must be a fixed sum, to be determined by the court, on the hearing, or afterwards on motion, and must not exceed the rate of costs allowed for similar services in actions.
