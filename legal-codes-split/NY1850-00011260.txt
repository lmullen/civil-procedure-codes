To compel the payment, or delivery, by an officer to such corporation, or to its creditors, of any money or property of such corporation, or the avails thereof, in his hands, or to pay the value of, or to deliver over, any property he may have -misapplied, or wasted, or acquired to himself, or withheld, in violation of his duty: 4. To remove an officer from his office on proof of gross misconduct: 5. To direct a new election to be held, to supply a vacancy, occasioned by such removal or otherwise: 6. In case such vacancy cannot be filled by the corporation, then to report the facts to the governor, who is hereby authorized to fill it: 7.
