Where the action is against two or more defendants, and the summons is served on one or more but not on all of them, the plaintifff may proceed as follows: 1. If the action be against the defendants jointly indebted upon an obligation, he may proceed against the defendants served, unless the court otherwise direct, and if he recover judgment, it may be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted, so far only as that it may be enforced against the joint property of all, and the separate property of the defendants served, and, if they are subject to arrest, against their persons: or, 2. If the action be against defendants severally liable, he may proceed against the defendants served, in the same manner as if they were the only defendants.
