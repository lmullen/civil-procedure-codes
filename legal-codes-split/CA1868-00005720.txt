Proceedings and punishments for contempts.‘

When a contempt is committed in the immediate view
and presence of the Justice, it’ may be punished summarily,
for which an order‘ shall be made re‘citiug the facts, as occur-‘
ring in such immediate view and presence, adjudging that
the person proceeded against is thereby  of a‘ contempt, and that he be punished‘ as therein prescribed.
When the contempt is not committed in‘ the immediate’
view and presence of the Justice, a warrant of arrest may
be issued by such’ Justice, on which the person so guilty
may be arrested and brought before the Justice immediately, when an opportunity to be heard in his defense or
excuse shall be given. The Justice may thereupon dis-‘
charge him, or may convict him of the offense. A Justice
may punish for contempts, by line or imprisonment, or
both’; such fine not to exceed in any case‘ one hundred dollars, and such imprisonment one day.
