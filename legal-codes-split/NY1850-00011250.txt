A corporation may be restrained by injunction, provisional or final, from, exercising any function or doing any act not allowed by law. Such injunction may be granted upon the application of the attorney general, or other officer authorized by statute, on satisfactory evidence that the corporation has usurped, exercised or claimed a franchise, privilege, or other corporate right, not authorized by law, or has done or suffered some other act, by which its corporate existence or, rights have become forfeited, or may by authority of law, be terminated.
