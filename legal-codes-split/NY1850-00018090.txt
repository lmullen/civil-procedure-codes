If a creditor appear and deny any of the material allegations of the application, or allege that the applicant has fraudulently contracted the debt to such creditor, or that such debt arose from a fraudulent misapplication by the applicant of the property of another, or that since it was contracted, the applicant, if a merchant, has not kept proper books of account; the court may either try the question of fact, or may order it to be tried by a jury or by referees.
