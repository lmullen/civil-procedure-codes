The application for a cause mentioned in the 4th and 5th subdivisions of section 805 can only be made, when notice thereof, oral or written, was given in open court, immediately after the verdict or other decision rendered; and thereupon if the adverse party consent, the court must appoint a day in the same term for hearing the application upon the judge’s minutes. If however the application be not heard at the same term, or if an appeal be taken, a statement of the case must be made.
