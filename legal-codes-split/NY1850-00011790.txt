Actions for fines and forfeitures, may be prosecuted by the officers or persons, to whom they are by law given, or who, by special provision of law, are authorized to recover them; and whether prosecuted by public officers, or by private persons, are governed by the same rules as other civil actions, except as otherwise specified in this chapter.
