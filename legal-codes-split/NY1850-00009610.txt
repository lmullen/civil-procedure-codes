The lien, mentioned in the last section, extends to all the real property of the judgment debtor in the county, owned by him at the time of the judgment, or afterwards acquired, and continues till the first day of July, 1860, on all unsatisfied judgments rendered or which may be rendered before that time. But after the first day of January, 1860, there can be no such lien.
