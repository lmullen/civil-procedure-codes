Persons committed on criminal process and detained for trial, and those committed for contempt or upon civil process, must be kept in separate rooms from those in which persons convicted and under sentence, are confined; and on no pretense whatever, can persons detained for trial or committed for contempt or on civil process, be kept or put in the same room with those convicted and under sentence.
