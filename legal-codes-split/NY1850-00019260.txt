There are, particular relations, in which it is the policy of the law to encourage confidence, and to preserve it inviolate; thereforee, a person cannot be examined, as a witness, in the following cases: 1. A husband cannot be examined, for or against his wife, without her consent, nor a wife, for or against her husband, without his consent, nor can either, during the marriage or afterwards, be, without the consent of the other, examined, as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage. But this exception does not apply to a civil action or proceeding, by one against the other, nor to a criminal action or proceeding, for a crime committed by one against the other; 2. An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined, as to any communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon, in the course of professional employment; 3. A clergyman, or priest cannot, without the consent of the person making the confession, be examined as to any confession made to him in his professional character, in the course of discipline, enjoined by the church to which he belongs; 4. A licensed physician or surgeon cannot, without the consent of his patient, be examined, in a civil action, as to any information acquired in attending the patient, which was necessary to enable him to prescribe or act for the patient: 5. A public officer cannot be examined as to communications made to him in official confidence, when the public interests would suffer by the disclosure.
