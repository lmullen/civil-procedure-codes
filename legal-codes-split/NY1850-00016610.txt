In cases, other than those mentioned in the last section, the court or officer may either issue a warrant of arrest, to bring the person charged to answer, or without a previous arrest, may, upon notice or upon an order to show cause, grant a warrant of commitment. But no warrant of commitment can be issued without such previous arrest to answer, or upon such notice or order to show cause.
