In any proceeding, pursuant to this chapter, to close the affairs of a corporation, the court may, on application of a stockholder, officer or creditor, restrain further proceedings by any creditor, in an action against the corporation, so far as may be proper, in order to prevent the waste of the funds by unnecessary litigation; and may by a notice, served or published as the court may direct, require all creditors to present and prove their claims, or become parties to the action, within a reasonable time, or be precluded from the benefit of any distribution, which may be made before such claim is proved.
