The officer must thereupon sell the property in the same manner as on execution against personal property in civil actions, and out of the proceeds of the sale, after deducting his own fees, pay to the distrainer the amount of the damage certified, the expense of the notice and also all other expense, that may have been reasonably incurred in the safe keeping and preservation of the property, to be ascertained and certified by the county judge, or by a justice of the peace of the county, and the balance, if any, pay to the owner of the property; or if he be unknown, to the county treasurer for the owner, to be paid to him upon the order of the county court upon making application and proof of property.
