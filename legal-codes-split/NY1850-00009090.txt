After hearing the charge, the jury may either decide in court, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they must be kept together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient place, under the charge of one or more officers, until they agree upon their verdict, or are discharged by the court. The officer must, to the utmost of his ability, keep the jury thus together, separate from other persons, without drink except water, and without food, except ordered by the court; he must not suffer any communication to be made to them, not make any himself, unless by order of the court, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their verdict, and he must not, before the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations or the verdict agreed on.
