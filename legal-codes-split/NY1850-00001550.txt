The courts known as the mayors’ courts of the cities of Albany, Hudson and Troy, the recorders’ courts of the cities of Buffalo, Utica and Oswego, and the city court of Brooklyn, are continued, with the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the next seven sections and no other: and shall be hereafter known as the city courts of those cities respectively. But nothing contained in this section affects their jurisdiction of actions or proceedings now pending therein, nor does it affect any judgment or order already made or proceeding already taken.
