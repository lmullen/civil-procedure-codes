If, after the empaneling of the jury, and before verdict, a juror become sick, so as to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order him to be discharged. In that case a new juror may be sworn, and the trial begin anew, or the jury may be discharged, and a new jury then or afterwards empaneled.
