Jurisdiction, when Court shall have acquired.

From the time of the service of the summons and copy of
complaint in a civil action, the Court shall be deemed to have
acquired jurisdiction, and to have control of all the subsequent proceedings. A voluntary appearance of a defendant

shall be equivalent to personal service of the summons upon

bun.
