The sureties, at any time before judgment against them upon their undertaking, may surrender the prisoner, or he may surrender himself to the sheriff or jailer, in exoneration of his sureties from a future liability, but not from a liability incurred before the surrender. The sheriff or jailer must thereupon, on the written requirement of the sureties, receive the prisoner into custody, and must endorse the surrender upon the undertaking, and if required, give to the sureties a certificate thereof.
