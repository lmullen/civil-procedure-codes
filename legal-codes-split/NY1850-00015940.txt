A copy of the complaint must be served upon-the defendant, with a notice from the plaintifff that unless the defendant previously surrender to the plaintifff possession of the premises, application will, at a specified time and place, be made to a justice of the town or a justices’ district where the property is situated, for a warrant of possession in favor of the plaintifff; or, 2. The complaint must be delivered to such justice, who shall make an order, requiring the defendant to surrender possession of the property to the plaintifff, or show cause before the justice, at a specified place and time, why a warrant of possession should not be issued in favor of the plaintifff.
