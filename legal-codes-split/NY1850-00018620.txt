The sheriff is liable to the county or city for the amount of every fine specified in the order, unless it appear by his return that the person, on whom the fine was imposed, has been arrested, or could not be found. Such liability may be enforced by action in the supreme court or by motion in the county court. The sheriff is liable by action for a false return.
