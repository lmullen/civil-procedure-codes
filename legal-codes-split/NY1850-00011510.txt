Legatees are liable to an action by a creditor of the testator to recover the value of any legacy received by them. The action may be brought against all or only one of the legatees. In such action the plaintifff cannot recover unless he shows: 1. That no assets were delivered by the executor or administrator of the deceased, to his next of kin: or 2. That the value of such assets has been recovered by some other creditor: or 3. That such assets are not sufficient to satisfy the demand of the plaintifff: And in the last case, he can recover only the deficiency. The whole amount which the plaintifff can recover, must be apportioned among all the legatees of the testator, in proportion to the amounts of their legacies respectively, and his proportion can only be recovered of each legatee.
