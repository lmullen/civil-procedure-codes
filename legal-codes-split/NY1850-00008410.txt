If the injunction be granted by a judge with out notice, the defendant, at any time before the trial, may apply, upon notice, to any judge of the court in which the action is brought, to vacate or modify the same. The application may be made upon the complaint and the affidavits on which the injunction was granted, or upon affidavits on the part of the defendant, with or without the answer.
