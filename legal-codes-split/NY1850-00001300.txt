The jurisdiction acquired by a surrogate’s court over a matter or proceeding, is exclusively of that of another surrogate’s court, except when otherwise provided by this code. And when a guardian is appointed or any other proceeding is commenced, in the surrogate’s court of a particular county, all further proceedings in respect to the same must be continued in that court.
