Where a plaintifff, or a defendant who has appeared, resides out of the state, and has no attorney in the action, the service may be made by mail, if his residence be known, if not known, on the clerk for him. But where a party has an attorney in the action, the service of papers must be upon the attorney, instead of the party.
