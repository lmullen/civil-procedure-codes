When an act is directed by statute to be performed by a sheriff, or process is issued to him, the duty, in case of the inability of the sheriff, from any cause, to perform it, devolves on the coroner, in the same manner, and with the same powers, duties and responsibilities, as if the process or order had required its performance by that officer.
