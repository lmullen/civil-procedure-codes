An exception is an objection taken at the trial to a decision upon a matter of law, whether such trial be by the jury, court, or referees, and whether the decision be made during the formation of a jury, the production of evidence, the charge to a jury, or at any other time from the calling of the action for trial to the rendering of the verdict or decision. But no exception is to be regarded on a motion for a new trial, or on an appeal, unless the exception be material, and affect substantial rights of the party.
