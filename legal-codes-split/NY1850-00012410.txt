The pleadings may be oral, except when the title to real property is brought in question, or they may be in writing; if oral, the substance of them must be entered by the justice in his docket; if in writing, they must be filed in his office, and a reference to them made in the docket. They are not required to be in any particular form, but must be such, as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.
