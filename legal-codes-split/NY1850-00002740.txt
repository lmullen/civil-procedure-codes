A vacancy in the office, or the disability of a judge or surrogate, whether existing in reference to a particular action or proceeding under the provisions of section 188, or from any other cause, must be determined by an order of the supreme court, entered with the clerk of the proper county. The order may be made upon affidavit, without notice, or upon notice, or upon an order to show cause, in the discretion of the court.
