If a reconciliation be had, a memorandum thereof, stating the nature of the controversy, or alleged cause of action, the appearance of the parties, and the fact of the reconciliation, without specifying the terms thereof, unless it be agreed by the parties to specify them, must be entered in a book of records, to be kept by the judge, and such entry must be signed by the respective parties. The reconciliation thus effected, shall be the final determination of the matter in controversy.
