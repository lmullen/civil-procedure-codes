Disobedience to a subpoena, or a refusal to be sworn or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition when required, may be punished as a contempt, by the court or officer issuing the subpoena, or requiring the witness to be sworn; and if the witness be a party, his complaint, answer or reply may be stricken out.
