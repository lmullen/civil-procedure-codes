When property, liable to an execution against several persons, is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is levied upon the property of one of them, or one of them pays without a sale more than his proportion, he may compel contribution from the others. And when a judgment is against several, and is upon an obligation of one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays the amount or any part thereof, either by sale of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. In such eases the person so paying, or contributing, is entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment, if within ten days after his payment he file with the clerk of the court, where the judgment was rendered, notice of his payment and claim to contribution or repayment. Upon the filing of such notice, the clerk must make an entry thereof in the margin of the docket.
