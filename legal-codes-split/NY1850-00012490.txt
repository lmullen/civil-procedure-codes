Either party may object to a pleading of his adversary, or to any part thereof; that it is not sufficiently explicit to enable him to understand it, or that it contains no cause of action or defense, although it be taken as true. If the court deem the objection well founded, it must order the pleading to be amended, and, if the party refuse to amend, the defective pleading must be disregarded.
