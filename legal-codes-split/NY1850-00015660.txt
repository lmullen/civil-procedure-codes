A mortgage of real property, to secure the payment of money only, and duly recorded in the county where the property is situated, may, at any time after default in the payment of principal or interest, be enforced by foreclosure and sale, as provided in this chapter. In all other cases the foreclosure of mortgages of real property, must be by action; and nothing in this section takes away the right of a party to foreclose by action in every case, at his option.
