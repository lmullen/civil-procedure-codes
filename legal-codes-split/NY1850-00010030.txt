If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the property, adverse to him, or denies the debt, such interest or debt is recoverable only in an action against such person or corporation, by the receiver: but the judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest, till a sufficient opportunity be given to the receiver to commence the action, and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. Such order may be modified or vacated, by the judge granting the same, at any time, on such security as he may direct.
