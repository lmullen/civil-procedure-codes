An officer to whom process is delivered, must execute it according to its command, or as required by this code or by special statutes; and must make a written return of the execution thereof. For a failure to do so, he is liable to an action, at the suit of the party aggrieved, for the damages sustained by him, in addition to any other fine or punishment.
