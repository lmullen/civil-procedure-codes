The jurors may be kept together in charge of proper officers, or may, in the discretion of the court, at any time before the submission of the cause to the jury, be permitted to separate. In either case, they may be admonished by the court, that it is their duty not to converse with any other person or among themselves, on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express any opinion thereon, until the cause is finally submitted to them.
