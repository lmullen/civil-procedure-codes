Every surrogate must receive, and deposit in his office, any last will and testament, delivered to him for that purpose, and give a written receipt thereforee. Such will must be enclosed in a sealed wrapper, so that its contents cannot be read, and be endorsed with the name of the testator, his place of residence, and the precise time of the deposit, and must not be read or opened, until delivered to a person entitled to it, as provided in the next section.
