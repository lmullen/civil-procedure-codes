There is a sheriff in each of the counties of this state, who is elected by the electors of the county, at a general election, once in every three years, and as often as there is a vacancy. The manner of his election and removal, of giving and renewing his official bonds, and of supplying a vacancy in his office, is prescribed by the constitution and by special statutes. His compensation is prescribed by this code, and by the code of criminal procedure.
