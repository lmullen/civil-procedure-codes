The process by which the attendance of a witness is required, is a subpoena. It is a writ or order directed to a person, and requiring his attendance, at a particular time and place, to testify as a witness. It may also require him to bring with him any books, documents, or other things under his control, which he is bound by law to produce in evidence.
