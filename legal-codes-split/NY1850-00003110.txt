At the time appointed, the sheriff or under sheriff, and the judge upon whom notice has been served, as prescribed in the last section, must attend at the office of the county clerk, to superintend the drawing. If either of those officers do not appear, the clerk must adjourn the drawing to the next day; and must, by written notice, require the delinquent sheriff or judge, or any two justices of the peace or police justices, to attend the drawing at that time. If the officers receiving notice, then appear, but not otherwise, the clerk must proceed in their presence to draw the grand jury.
