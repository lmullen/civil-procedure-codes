A trial by jury must be demanded at the time of joining issue; and is waived, if neither party then demand it. When demanded, the trial of the case must be adjourned, until a time and place fixed for the return of the jury. If neither party desire an adjournment, the time and place must be determined by the justice, and must be on the same day or within the next two days. The jury must be immediately drawn and summoned, and the return thereof made as prescribed in sections 317, 318, and 319.
