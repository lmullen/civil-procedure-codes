An injunction to suspend the general and ordinary business of a corporation must not be granted except by the court. Nor must it be granted, without due notice of the application thereforee, to the proper officers of the corporation, except where the people of this state are a party to the proceeding, and except in proceedings to enforce the liability of stockholders in corporations and association for banking purposes, after the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, as such proceedings are or shall be provided by law, unless the plaintifff give a written undertaking, executed by two sufficient sureties, to be approved by the court, to the effect that the plaintifff will pay all damages not exceeding the sum to be mentioned in the undertaking, which such corporation may sustain, by reason of the injunction, if the court finally decide that the plaintifff was not entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference, or otherwise, as the court directs.
