In pleading the performance of conditions precedent in a contract, it shall not be necessary to state the facts showing such performance; but it may be stated generally that the party duly performed
all the conditions on his part; and if such allegation be controverted,
the party pleading, shall establish, on the trial, the facts showing such
performance.
