Undertaking on appeal concerm'ng real property.

If the judgment or order appealed from direct the sale, or
delivery of possession of real property, the execution of the
same shall not he stayed, unless a written undertaking be executed on the part of the appellant, with two or more sureties, to the effect that during the possession of such property
by the appellant, he will not commit, or suffer to be committed, any waste thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed,
he will pay the value of the use and occupation of the property from the time of the appeal until the delivery of possession thereof, pursuant to the judgment or order, not
exceeding a sum to be fixed by the Judge of the Court by
which the judgment was rendered or order made, and which
shall be specified in the undertaking. When the judgment
is for the sale of mortgaged premises, and the payment of a
deficiency arising upon the sale, the undertaking shall also
provide for the payment of such deficiency.
