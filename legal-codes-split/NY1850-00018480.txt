Where property is subject to dower, and the person entitled thereto consents in writing to accept a sum in place thereof, or the income during life of a permanent investment of a reasonable sum, the court may ascertain and direct the payment of such sum out of the proceeds of the property, or the investment thereof and the payment of the income, as may be deemed reasonable and may be acceptable to the penson entitled. If no such consent be given the sale or mortgage must be made subject to the right of dower. Before any sum shall be paid or investment made, an effectual release of the right of dower must be made.
