In the city and county of New-York, the sheriff has the custody of the county jail for the confinement of persons committed for contempt or upon civil process. The prison in that city and county, for the detention of persons committed in default of security to appear as witnesses in a criminal action, or charged with crime and committed for trial, or sentenced to imprisonment therein upon conviction of a public offense, is known as the city prison; and that for the imprisonment therein upon conviction of a public offense, is known as the penitentiary. Both these prisons are under the charge of the governors of the alms house of the city of New-York, whose powers in this respect are regulated by special statutes.
