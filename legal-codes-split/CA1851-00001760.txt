After hearing the charge, the Jury may either decide in
Court, or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they shall be kept
together in a room provided for them, or some other convenient place,
under the charge of one or more Odicers, until they agree upon their
verdict, or are discharged by the Court. The Otiicer shall, to the
utmost of his ability, keep the Jury together, separate from other persons; he shall not suffer any communication to be made to them,

or make any himself, unless by order of the Court, except to ask them
if they have agreed upon their verdict; and he shall not, before
the verdict is rendered, communicate to any person the state of their deliberations, or the verdict agreed upon. ‘
