The defendant, immediately upon being arrested, must be taken to the office of the justice who made the order, and if he be absent, or unable to try the action, or if it be made to appear to him, by the affidavit of the defendant that he is a material witness in the action, the constable must immediately take the defendant before the next justice of the city or town, who must take cognizance of the action, and proceed thereon, as if the summons had been issued, and the order of arrest made by him.
