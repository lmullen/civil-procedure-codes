If a witness be concealed in a building or vessel, so as to prevent the service of a subpoena, upon him, the court or officer issuing the subpoena, may, upon proof by affidavit, of the concealment, and of the materiality of the witness, make an order, that the sheriff of the county serve the subpoena, and the sheriff must serve it accordingly, and for that purpose may break into the building or vessel, where the witness is concealed.
