Every material allegation of the complaint not specifically controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section 645; and every material allegation of new matter in the answer constituting a counterclaim, not specifically controverted by the reply, as prescribed in section 651, must for the purposes of the action, be taken as true. But the allegation of new matter in the answer not relating to a counterclaim, or of new matter in a reply, is to be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct denial, or avoidance as the case may require.
