When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view
and presence of the Court or Judge, a warrant of attachment may be
issued to bring the person charged to answer, or without a previous
arrest, a warrant of commitment may upon notice, or upon an order to
show cause, be granted; and no warrant of commitment shall be issued
without such previous attachment to answer, or such notice or order to
show cause.
