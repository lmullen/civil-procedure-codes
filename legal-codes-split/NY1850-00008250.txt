The defendant may within three days after the service of a copy of the affidavit and undertaking, give notice to the sheriff that he excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If he fail to do so, he must be deemed to have waived all objection to them. When the defendant excepts, the sureties must justify on notice in like manner, as upon bail on arrest. And the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived as above provided, or until they justify. If the defendant except to the sureties, he cannot reclaim the property, as provided in the next section.
