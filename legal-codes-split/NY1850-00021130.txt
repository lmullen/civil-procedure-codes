An oath is usually administered as follows: the person, who swears, lays his hand upon the gospels, while the person administering the oath, thus addresses him: “You do swear that the evidence you shall give in this issue, (or matter) pending between __ and __, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God,” and thereupon the person, who swears, assents by kissing the book.
