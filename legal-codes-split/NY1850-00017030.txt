A copy of the order must be served personally on all the members of the corporation residing and to be found, in the same county, at least ten days before the time appointed, in the same manner as a summons in an action. It must be served on all other persons interested, either personally or by publication thereof, for three weeks successively, next before the time of appearance, in a newspaper printed in the county. The judge may also require its publication in one or more other newspapers, if he deem it necessary, in order to give notice to the persons interested.
