Proceedings must be stayed, when the application grows out of a sale by execution or foreclosure of a mortgage, if, at any time before the issuing of the warrant, the occupant: 1. Pay the costs of the proceedings: 2. File with the justice an affidavit, that he claims the possession of the property, by virtue of a title acquired after the sale, which defeats the plaintifff’s right of possession, or that he claims as guardian or trustee of another not made a defendant: and 3. Deliver to the plaintifff an undertaking, with sureties approved by the justice, to the effect, that he will commit no waste during his occupancy of the property, and that if an action be brought by the plaintifff, within three months, for the recovery of the possession thereof, he will pay the costs, and such damages as may be recovered therein for withholding the possession.
