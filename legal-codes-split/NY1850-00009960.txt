Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, as provided in the last two sections, the judge may, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise, to his satisfaction that there is danger of the debtor’s leaving the state, or concealing himself, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where such debtor may be, to arrest him and bring him before such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, he may be examined on oath, and ordered to enter into an undertaking with one or more sureties, that he will attend from time to time before the judge or referee, as he shall direct, during the pendency of the proceeding, and until the final determination thereof, and will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of his property, not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking, he may be committed to prison, by warrant of the judge.
