Whenever the judges of the supreme court, in any district, find, that the court, at any term or circuit, has not been or will not be able to dispose of all the cases upon the calendar, it shall be their duty to request the governor to assign other judges, and if necessary appoint extraordinary terms and circuits, for the purpose of disposing of such cases. The governor must thereupon make such assignment, and the judges assigned must hold the courts accordingly. This provision shall last, so long as any of the actions and suits now pending remain undetermined.
