Persons, capable of contracting, may submit to arbitration any controversy, which might be the subject of a civil action between them, except a question of title to real property, in fee or for life, or for an existing term of more than twelve years. This qualification does not include questions relating merely to the partition, or boundaries of real property, or to the admeasurement of dower.
