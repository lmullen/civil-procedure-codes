Whenever an object, cognizable by the senses, has such a relation to the fact in dispute, as to afford reasonable grounds of belief respecting it, or to make an item in the sum of the evidence, such object may be exhibited to the jury, or its existence, situation and character may be proved by witnesses. The admission of such evidence must be regulated by the sound discretion of the court.
