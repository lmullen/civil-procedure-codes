Devisees made liable, by the foregoing provisions of this chapter, to the creditors of their testator, are not so liable, unless it appear that his personal assets and the real property of the testator descended to his heirs were insufficient to discharge the debt; or unless it appear, that after due proceedings before the surrogate, the creditor has been unable to recover the debt, or any part thereof, from the personal representatives of the testator, or from his next of kin or legatees, or from his heirs.
