To render an appeal effectual for any purpose, a written undertaking must be executed, on the part of the appellant, by at least two sureties, to the effect that the appellant will pay all damages, costs and charges, which may be awarded against him on the appeal, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars or that sum must be deposited with the clerk, with whom the judgment or order was entered, to abide the event of the appeal. But such undertaking or deposit may be waived by a written consent on the part of the respondent.
