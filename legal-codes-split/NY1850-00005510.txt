When a sheriff is authorized to summon a jury of inquest, or when, in any special proceeding, a jury is authorized, and express provision for drawing it is not made by a particular provision of this code, the jury may be drawn from any justice’s jury-box, in the presence of the justice, by drawing the names of eighteen jurors, summoning them, and at the time of appearance, drawing or selecting from those who appear, the number sufficient to complete the jury.
