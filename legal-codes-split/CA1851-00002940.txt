The rights of the several parties, plaintifffs as well as defendants, may be put in issue, tried and determined by such action; and
when a sale of the premises is necessary, the title shall be ascertained
by proof to the satisfaction of the Court, before the judgment of sale

shall be made; and where service of the complaint has been made by
publication, like proof shall be required of the right of the absent or
unknown parties, before such judgment is rendered ; except that where
there are several unknown persons having an interest in the property,
their rights may be considered together in the action, and not as
between themselves.
