As soon after the first day of June in each year, as the trial jury list is completed, the commissioner of jurors must publish, for at least ten days, in the manner prescribed by the board of supervisors, a notice that the trial jury list will be open at his office daily, between nine o’clock in the forenoon and five o’clock in the afternoon, for examination and correction, until a specified day, at least thirty days from the last publication of the notice.
