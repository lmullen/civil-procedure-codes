The party preparing a statement is to propose a draft of it, and, within five days after the trial, serve it upon the adverse party, who may within five days thereafter, propose amendments to it. If no amendment be proposed, the draft is adopted; if proposed, the statement and amendments may be submitted for settlement to the judge, or referee, before whom the trial was had, upon a notice of five days: if such notice be not served within five days after the amendments are proposed, they are adopted.
