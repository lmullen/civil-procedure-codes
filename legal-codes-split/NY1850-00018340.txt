Such reasonable sum, for the costs of the party applying for admeasurement, as may be certified by the court, not exceeding twenty dollars, for each parcel of land out of which dower may be separately admeasured, besides referees’ fees and other disbursements, must be paid, one-half by the widow and the other half by the adverse party.
