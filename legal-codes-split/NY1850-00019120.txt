A written notice, as well as every other writing, is to be construed according to the ordinary acceptation of its terms. Thus a notice to the drawers or endorsers of a bill of exchange or promissory note, that it has been protested for want of acceptance or payment, must be held to import, that the same has been duly presented for acceptance or payment, and the same refused, and that the holder looks for payment, to the person to whom the notice is given.
