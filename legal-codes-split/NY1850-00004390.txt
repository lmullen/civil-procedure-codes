There are six police clerks in the city of New-York, who are appointed by the common council of that city, and hold their offices for four years. They are assigned to police districts, in the manner prescribed by the common council, under the authority of special statutes, and are, by virtue of their offices, clerks of the police courts in the districts to which they are thus assigned.
