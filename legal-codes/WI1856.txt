course

of

in all
cases,
should be
established:

or protection
of-a right, the redress
or pre-

of
a wrong,

prevention
of
a public
offense.

a
party
against
a
person
charged
with
a 
public
offense,
for the
punishment
thereof.
Sa.

Every
other
is
a civil
action. 
Szo.
7. Where the violation of
a right admits of both a
civil
and
criminal
remedy,
the
right
to
prosecute
the
one
is
not
merged
in
the
other.
Sao.

act
relates
to civil
actions

it

at least
of such

acquainted
with
the facts,

inch party
be within

of making
the affidavit.
The affidavit
may also
be made
by the
agent
or attorney,
if
the action
or defense
be founded
upon
a written
instrument
for
the

such instrument
be in

the
material
allegations
of the
pleadings
be within
the
personal
knowledge

of

the agent or ttorney.
When the pleading
is
verifled
by
any other
person
than
the party,
he
shall set
forth
in the
affidavit
his knowledge,
or the grounds
of his
belief
on the
subject,
and the
reasons
why it
is not
made
by the
party.
When
a corporation
is a party,
the verification

may

be

made
by
any
officer
thereof.
And
when
the
state,

any
officer
thereof
in
its
behalf
is
a
party,
the verification
may be
made by
any
person acquainted
with the
facts.
The verification
may be
omitted
when
an
admission
of the truth
of
the allegations
might
subject
the
party to
prosecution
for
felony.
And no
pleading
can
be used
in a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
party
as
proof
of a fact
admitted
or
alleged
in such
pleading.

particular
or
particulars

time within
twenty days after the service

it be made to appear
to
the
court
that
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
delay,
and the plaintifff or defendant will thereby lose the benefit
of
a term or circuit for which
it is or may be noticed,
and
If it appear to the court, that each amendment was made
for that purpose, the same may be stricken out and such
terms imposed as
to the court may seem
just. In such
case a copy of the
amended pleading must
be served on
the adverse party.
After the decision
of a demurrer,
either at
a generel or special term,
the court may, in its
discretion, it it appear that the demurrer was interposed
in good
faith, allow
the party
to plead
on such terms
as
may
seem just.
If the demurrer
be allowed
for the
cause
mentioned in the 5th
sub-division of section

court may, in its discretion,

may

with
the

proof
of
personal

and
complaint
on one
or
more
of
the

or

summons,
according
to
the
provisions
of
section
35,
and
that
no

The

shall
thereupon
enter
judgment
for
the
amount
mentioned
in
the
summons
against
the
defend-
ant
or
defendants,
or
against
one
or
more
of
several
defendants,

in

the

cases

provided

for

in

complaint
be
not
sworn
to,
and
such
action
is on
an
instrument
for
the
payment
of money
only,
the
clerk,
on
its production
to him,
shall
assess
the
amount
due
to the
plaintifff
thereon;
and
in
other
cases
shall
ascertain
the
amount
which
the
plaintifff
is entitled
to
recover
in
such
action
from
his
examination
under
oath,
or
other
proof,
and
enter

In
case

time
and
place
of
such
assessment.

to
the
court
after
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
answering,
for
the
relief
demanded
in
the
complaint.
If
the
taking
an account
or the
proof
of
any
fact
be
necessary

to

enable

the

court

to

give

judgment

or

to

carry
the
judgment
into
effect,
the
court
'ray
take
the account,
or
hear
the
proof,
or may
in its
dis
etion,
order
a
refer-
ence
for
that
purpose.
And
where
the
action
is
for
the
recovery
of
money
only,
or of
specific,
real
or
personal
property,
with
damages
for
the
withholding,
thereof,
the
court
may
order
the
damages
to be
assessed
by a
jury,
or
if
the examination
of
a long
account
be
involved,
by
a
reference as

relief
demanded
by
the
complaint,
3. In
actions
where
the
service
of the
summons
was
by 
publication,
the plaintifff may in like
manner apply for 
judgment,
and
the
court
shall
thereupon
cause
proof
to 
be
taken
of
the
demand
mentioned
in
the
complaint,
and
in cas the defendant is a non-resident, shall cause the
plaintifff or his agent
to be examined on oath,
as to any
payment
that may
have been
made to
such plaintifff,
or to
any one for his use on account
of such demand, and may
render judgment
for the
amount
which he
is entitled
to
recover,
and before
enteringjudgment,
the
court may,
in
its
discretion, require the plaintifff
to cause to be filed
satisfactory

security

ing the restitution of any estate or effects which may be
directed by
such judgment to be transferred
or delivered,
or the restitution
of any money that may
be collected
under or

in case the defendant
or his representatives, shall apply and be admitted
to defend

the
action
and sball succeed
in
such defense.
