ject to the order of said court; and after the plaintifff shall have established his demand
against the absent debtor, the court may in its discretion direct the clerk to deliver to
the plaintifff in such attachment, his agent or attorney, such note or notes, bond or

plaintifff shall make it appear that after due diligence used by him he was 'col

Sec. 10. Whereas, the said judiciary was intended for the purpose of bringing parties
litigant to a speedy judicial decision without delay, and with as little costs as practi

be amended on motion, without delay or costs, and it having grown into practice in
said courts, to give or grant a term, and sometimes nonsuit, for the smallest omis

grown into use in the several courts of law in this state; and no nonsuit shall be
awarded when the cause of action is substantially set forth in the declaration, for any
formal variance between the allegation and proof.
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That no part of an answer shall be stricken out
or rejected on account of being contradictory to another part of the same answer, but
the court shall be bound to suffer the whole answer to remain, if the defendant should
desire it, and avail himself of any advantage he can or may have under either or the
whole of the said answer, and proceed to trial accordingly.
Sec. 10. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the state of Georgia,
