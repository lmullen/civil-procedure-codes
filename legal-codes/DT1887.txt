4. If the name of one or more partners shall, for any cause, 
have been omitted in any action i11 which judgment shall have

omission shall not have been pleaded in such action, the plaintifff, 
in case the judgment therein shall remain unsatisfied, may by 
action recover of such partner separately, upon proving his joint
liability, notwithstanding he may nothave been named in the 
original action; but the pla'intiff shall have satisfaction of only

all the subsequent proceedings, A voluntary appearance of a 
defendant is equivalent to personal service of the summons upon,
him.

scri e y re pal' y or 11s a or11ey; and when any pleading is 
verified, every subsequent pleading, except a demurr .. er, must be 
'fl d l 
ver1 e. a so. 
4922. The ver .. ifications must be to the effect that the
same is true to the kuowledge of the person making it, except 
as to those matters stated upon information and belief, and as to
those matters he believes it to be true, except where it is made 
by any person other than a party to the action, in which case it
must be to the effect that tho same is true 1-,0 'the best knowledge, 
information and belief of the person making it; and such verification must be by the affidavit of party, or if th e1e be several 
parties united in interest and pleading together, by 011e at least
of such parties acquainted with the facts, if such party be within
the county where the attor .. ney resides and capable of makirrg
the affidavit. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or
attorney if the party is absent from the county i11 which such 
attorney resicles, or is not a resident thereof'; and when tho pleacl- 
ing is verified by any other person than the party he shall set
forth in the affidavit the reasons why it is not inade by the party. 
When a corporation is a par .. ty the verification may be made by 
any officer thereof; and when the territory 01" any officer thereof
i11 its behalf is, a party, the verification may be made by any per .. - 
son acquainted with the facts. T.he verification may be omitted
when a11 admission of the truth of the allegation might subject 
the party to prosecution for f elony, and no pleading can be use cl
in a criminal prosecution against the party as proof of a fact ad
mitted or alleged i11 such pleading. 
4923. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth i11 
a pleading the items of an account therein alleged; but he shall 
deliver to the ad verse party, within ten clays after the clemand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading 
is verified, must be verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent 01 .. 
attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true, or be preeluded from giving evidence ther .. eof. The court, or a judge
thereof, may order a "further account," when the one deliverecl
is defective; and the court may i11 all cases order a bill of par- 
ticulars of' the claim of either party to be furnished. 
i924. 111 the construction of a pleading for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegation shall be liberally construed, 
with a view of substantial justice between the parties. . 
1925: If irrelevant. or redundant matte:r be inserted 111 a,
plead111g, it may be stricken out, on mot1011 of any person 
aggrjeved thereby. And when the allegations of a pleading are
so indefinite or uncertain that the precise nature of the charge 
or defense is not apparent, the -court n1ay 1--equire tl1e plea;cli11g, to
be macle clefinite and c.ertai11 by amendme11t. 
~ 492.6. In pleadi11g a judg1-:r1ent, or otl1er deter1ni11atiori of
a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it sl1all 11ot be 11ecessary 
- 
to state. the facts couferr ing jurisdiction, but such judgmentor
determination may be stated to have been duly g.iven or made. 
If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establisl1, on the trial, the facts conferring jurisdiction.

4927. 111 pleading the performance of conditions precedent 
h 11 b t th f h 
IP a contract; it S a not e necessary O state e acts S owing 
such performance; but it may be stated generally that the party
tions be controverted, the party plea ing shall be bound to 
establish, 011 the trial, the facts showing such performance, In 
an action or defense founded upon an instrument for the payment of money 011ly, it shall be sufficient for a party to give a 
copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due to him 
thereon from the ad verse varty a specified sum which he claims.
4928. I11 pleading a private statute, or a right derived 
therefrom, it shall be suffi.cient to refer to such statute, by its
title and the clay of its passage, and the court shall thereupon 
take judicial notice ther .. eof. 
4929. In a11 action for libel or slancler, it shall not be 
necessary to state i11 the complaint any intr .. insic facts, for the 
purpose of showing the application to the plaintifff of the defama- 
i.or .. Y matter .. out of which the cause of action arose, but it shall
be sufficient to state generally that the same was published or 
spoken concerning the plaintifff, and if such allegation be controverted, the plaintifff shall be bound to establish, on trial, that 
it was so published or spoken. 
4930. I11 the actions mentioned i11 the last section, the
aefendant may, i;n his answer, allege both the truth of the mat- 
ter charged as defamatory and any mitigating circumstances, to
reduce the amount of <damages; ancl whether he prove the justi
fication or not, he may give, i11 evidence, the mitigating cir
cumstances, ..
4931. 111 a11 action to recover the possession of property 
distrained doing clamage, an answer that the defendant or person by whose command he actecl was lawfully possessed of the 
real property upon which the distress was made, and that the
property distrained was at the time doing damage thereon, shall 
be good, without setting forth the t.itle to such real property, 
4932. 'I'he plaintifff may unite in the same complaint several causes of action, whether they be such as have been hereto- 
fore denominated legal or equitable, OI'" both, where they all rise 
out of: , 
1. / The same transaction, or transactions connected with the

damagos for the withholding thereof; or, 
7. Claims against a trustee, by v irtue of a oorrtract, or by

But the causes of act101J., so 1..1111ted, must ~11 belong to one, o
these classes, arid, except i11 actions for the foreclosure of mo.rt~ 
.gages, must affect all the parties to the act1011, and not require

examination under oath, or other proof, and enter the judgment
for the amount so assessed or ascertained. I11 case tho defendant

five clays' notice of the time and place of such assessment.
Where the defendant, by his answer i11 any such action, shall not
deny the plaintifff's claim, but shall set up a counterclaim,
amounting to less than the plaintifff's claim, judgment may be 
had by the plaintifff for the excess of said claim over the saicl coun ..

w hero the action is f 01-- the recovery of money only, or of specific
real or personal property, with clamages for 'the witholding 
'ther .. eof, the court. may order the damages to Le assessed by a

3. - I11 actions where the service of the sum111011s was by pub

and the court must thereupon requir .. e proof to be made of the
demand mentioned in the complaint; and if the defendant be not 
a resident of the terr itory, must require the plaintifff 01 .. his agent
to be examinecl 011 oath respecting any payments that have been

by ~ brief description of the property, which is the subject of the 
action .
. 5368. The defendants who have been personally served 
with the s1~mmo11s and a ~opy of the complaint, or who have
appeared without such service, must set forth i11 their answors

spective interests i11 the proper .. ty; and if such defendants claim 
a lien on the property ~y mortgage, judgment, 01otherwise, 
they must state the original amount and date of the same, and 
the sum remaining due thereon; also whether the same has been 
secured in any other way, or not; and if secured, tl1e nature and
extent of such security, or they are deemed to have waived their 
right to such lien.
5369. 'I'he rights of the several parties, plaintifff as well 
as defendant, may be put i11 issue, tried and determined, in such
action; and w hen a sale of the premises is necessary, the title
must be ascertained by proof to the satisfaction of the court, 
before the judgment of sale can be made; and wher .. e service of
the complaint has been macle by publication, like proof must be
required of the right of the absent 01" unknown parties before 
such judgment is renderecl; except that where there are several
unknown persons hav ing a11 interest i11 the property, their rights 
may be considered together in the action, as not between them
selves.
5370. Whenever from any cause it is, in the opinion of 
the court, impracticable or highly inconvenient to make a complete partition, i11 the first instance, among all the parties i1
inter .. est, the court may first ascer .. tain and determine the shares or
interest respectively helcl by the 01 .. iginal co-tenants.and thereupon
adjudge and cause a partition to be made, as if such original
co-tenants were the parties and sole parties, in interest, and the
only parties to the action, and thereafter may proceed i11 like
manner to acljudge and make partition separately of each share 
or portion so ascertained or allotted as between those claiming
under the original tenant to whom the same shall have been so
set apart, or may allow them to remain tenants i11 common 
thereof, as they may desire. 
5371. If it appear to the court by the certificate of the 
register of deeds, or clerk of the district court, or by the sworn
or verified statement of any person who may have examined 01" 
searched the recorcls that there are outstanding liens or incumbrances of record upon such real property, or any part or portion
thereof, which existed and were of record at the time of the com
mencement of the action, and the persons holcling such liens 
are not made parties to the action, the court must either order
such persons to be made parties to the action by a11 amendment 
or supplemental complai nt, or appoint a l"eferee to ascertain
whetl1er 01" not such liens or encumbrances have been paid, or,
if not paicl, what amount remains due thereon, ancl their .. order 
among the liens 01encumbrances severally held by such persons 
and the parties to the action, and whether the amount remaining due thereon has been secured ~11 any manner, and. 'if secured,
the nature ancl extent of the security. 
5372. The plairitiff must cause a notice to be served a
reasonable time previous to the day for appearance before the
referee appointed as provided in the prececling section, 011 each
person having outstanding liens of record, who is not a party to
the action, to appear before the referee at a specified time and
place, to make proof, by his own affidavit or otherwise, of the
amount due or to become due contingently or absolutely thereon.
In case such person be absent, or his residence be unknown, service may be made by publication or notice to his agent, under
the direction of the court, in such manner as may be proper.
The report of the ref eree thereon must be made to the court, and
must be confirmed, modified, or set aside, and a new reference
ordered, as the justice of the case rriay require. 
5373. If it be alleged in the complaint and established by
evidence, or if it appear by the evidence without such allegation 
i11 the complaint, to the satisfaction of the court, that the property or any part of it, is so situated that .partition cannot be
made without great prejudice to the owners, the court may
order a sale thereof. Otherwise upon the requisite proof being 
made, it must order .. a partition accor .. ding to the respective rights
of the parties, as ascertained by the court, and appoint thr .. ee
referees therefore'; and must designate the portion to remain
undivided for the owners whose interests remain unknown, or 
are not ascertained.
5374. In making the partition, referees must divide the 
property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective
parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to 
the respective rights of the parties as determined by the court,
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, designating the sev
eral portions by proper landmarks, and may employ a surveyor
with the necessary assistants to aid them. Before making partition or sale, the referees may, whenever it will be for the 
advantage of those interested, set apart a portion of the property
for a way, road or street, and the portion so set apart shall not 
be assigned to any of the parties, or sold, but shall remain an
open and public way, road or street, unless the referees shall set 
the same apart as a private way for the use of the parties interested, or some of them, their heirs or assigns, in w hich case it 
shall remain such private way. 
537 5. The referees must make a report of their proceed
ings, specifying therein the 1na1111e1-- in which they executed their
trust, and describing the property divided, and the share allotted 
to each party, with a particular description of each sh?'re.
5376. 'I'he court may confirm, change, modify, or set 
asi e, the report, and if necessary, appoint new referees. Upon
the report being confirmed, judgment must be rendered t~a~ 
such partition be effectual forever, which judgment is binding 
ancl conclusive: . 
1. On all persons named as parties ~o the action, a11~ thei!
legal representatives, who have at the time any interest in th 
property divided, 01~ any part thereof, a~ owners in fee, o~ 
tenants for life, or for years, or as e11t1tled to the reversi t 
remainder or the inheritance of such pro1)erty, or any p~r
thereof after the determination of a pa1--tic11lar estate th~r1e!n, 
ancl wl{o by any contingency may be entitled to a benefic1a in-

t1on by publication, . 
3. On. all other persons claiming from such parties or per-sons, or either of them. 
And no judg~ent is invalidated ~y reason of the death of any
party before final judgment or decree; but such judgment or 
decree is as conclusive against . th_e heirs, legal representatives
or assigns of such decedent as if it had been entered before his 
death, 
5377. The judgment does not affect tenants for years 
Iess than t~~' to the whole of the property which is the subject 
of the partition. ,

-surveyor and his assistants, when employed, must be ascertained 
and allowed by the court, and the amount thereof, together with
the fees allowed by the court, in its discretion, to the referees, 
must be apportioned among the different parties to the action,
equitably. 
5379. When a lien is 011 a11 undivided interest or estate of 
-any of the parties, such lien, if a partition be made, shall thenoeforth be a charge only on the share assigned to such party; but 
-such share must first be charged with its just proportion of the
costs of the partition, in preference to such lien. 
5380. When a part of the property only is orderecl to be
-sold, if there be an estate for life or years, in an undivided share 
of the whole property, such estate may be set off i11 any part of
the property, not ordered to be sold. . 
5381. The proceeds of the sale of incumbered property 
m ust be applied under the direction of the court, as follows: 
1. To pay its just proportion of the general costs of the 
-action. 
2. To pay the costs of the reference. 
3. To satisfy and cancel of record the several liens in their
order of priority, by payment of the sums due and to become 
-due: the amount due to be verified by affidavit at the time of
.payment. . 
4. The residue among the owners of the property sold,
according to their respective shares therein .. 
5382. Whenever any party to an action who holds a lien
upon the property, or any part thereof, has other securities for 
the payment of the amount of such lien, the court may, in its
discretion, order such security to be exhausted before distribu- 
tion of the proceeds of sale, or may order a just deduction .to be
made from the amount of the lien on the property on account 
thereof. 
The proceeds of sale and the securities taken by the
referees, or any part thereof, must be distributed. by them to the 
5383. 
]>ersons entitled thereto, whenever the court so directs. But .1n
case no direction be given, all of such proceeds and seourities 
must be paid into court, or deposited therein, or as directed by
the court. ,

require such parties to present the facts or law in controversy, by 
pleadings as i11 a11 original action. 
5385. All sales of real property, made by referees under
this chapter, must be made at public auction to the highest
bidder, upon notice published in the manner required for the
sale of real property 011 execution. The notice must state the
terms of sale, and if the property, or any part of it, is to be sold

5387. The refer .. ees may take separate mortgages and. 
other secur .. ities for .. the whole or convenient portions of the pur

infant, i11 the name of the guardian of such infant: a11.d for other
shares i11 the name of the clerk of the district court, and his sue
cessors in office. 
5388. 'I'he person entitled to a tenancy for life, or years, 
whose estate has been sold, is entitled to receive such sum as.
may be deemed a reasonable satisfaction for such estate, and
which the person so entitled may consent to accept instead 
thereof, by a11 instrument i11 writing, filed with the clerk of the-court. U 1)011 the filing of such consent, the clerk must enter the
same i11 the minutes of the court. 
5389. If such consent be not given, filecl and entered as
providecl in the last section, at or before a judgment of sale is. 
rendered, the court must ascer tain and determine what proportion of the proceecls of the sale, afterdeducting expenses, will be
a just and reasonable sum to be allowed 011 account of such 
estate, and must order the same to be paid to such party, or 
deposited i11 court for him, as the case may requir .. e. . 
5390. If the per .. sons entitled to such estate for life or
years be unknown, the court must provide for the protection of

proportionate value of such contingent or vested rigl~t or estate, 
and must direct such proporfion of the proceeds of the sale to be

ihoncls executed by executors or administrators, with the affi- 
-davits and certificates thereon must be f'orthwith recorded by
the judge in books to be kept by l1im i11 his office for that pur-

5,725. Every executor, administrator or guardian appointed
in, but residing 011t of the territory, shall, before entering_ upo_n

ihe county where he is appointed, and shall by such writing 
-stipulate and agree that the service of any legal process against
him as such executor, administrator or guardian if made 011 said 
. agent shall be of the same legal effect as if made 011 himself
personally within the territory. Such writing shall give the
-prope1 .. address of such agent and shall be filed in the office of 
.the judge of the probate court where such appointment is made. 
57~6. Every person to whom letters testamentary or of
.:administration are directed to issue, must, before receiving them,
-ezecute a bond to the territory of Dakota, with two or more suffi
clent sureties, to be approved by the judge of the probate court.
In form the bond must be joint and several, and the penalty
must not be less than twice the value of the personal property, 
~nd twice the probable value of _t11e annual rents, profits and 
:J.SSu,es of the real property belonging to the estate, which values 
111t1Rt be ascertained by the probate judge, by examining on oath
the party applying, and a11y other persons. 
5727. The judge must require an additional bond whenever the sale of any real estate belonging .. to an estate is ordered!
by him; but 110 such additional bond must be required when it. 
satisfactorily appears to the court that the penalty of the bond 
given befoi .. e receiving letters, or any bond given in place thereof
is equal to twice the value of the personal property remaining in,.
or that will come into the possession of the executor or adminis
trator, including the annual rents, profits, and issues of real
estate still belong ing to the estate, and twice the probable 
amount to be realized 011 the sale of the real estate ordered to be 
sold. 
5728. 'I'he bond must be conditioned that the executor or'
administr .. ator shall faithfully execute the cluties of the trust 
according to la W, . 
5729. Wl1e11 two 01 .. more persons are appointed executors
01-- administrators, the judge of the probate court must require, 
and take a separate bond f101n each ofthem, 
5730. The bond shall not be void upon the first recovery,
but may be sued and recovered upon from time to time, by any
person aggrieved, in his own name, until the whole penalty is.
exhausted. 
5 7 31. 111 all cases vv here boncls are required to. be given; 
under this title, the officer taking the same must. require the
sureties to accompany it w ith a11 affidavit that they are-each resi
dents and householders or freeholders wifhin the-territory, and: 
are each worth the sum specified in the bond, over- and: above all
their just debts and liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from,
execution; but when the amount specified in the bond, exceedsone thousand dollars, and there are morethan. two sureties
thereon, they may state in their afficla vits that they areseverally .
worth amounts less than that expressed in the bond, if the whole 
amount be equivalent to that of two sufficient sureties, and theaffidavits thereof must be- attached to, and filed' and recorded with. 
the bond. All such bonds must be approved by the judge of the
probate court before being filed and 1 .. ecorded, Before the judge- 
of the probate court approves any bond required under this title,
and after its approval l1e may of his: own motion, or upon the
motion of any person interested in the estate, supported by affidavit that the sureties or some 011.e or more of them are not worth 
as much as they have justified to, issue acitation, 1 .. equiring such.
sureties to appear before him, at a designated. time and place, to, 
be examined touching their property and its 'value; and the
judge must, at the same time, issue a notice to the executor
or administrator, requiring his appearance on the return of th,e
citation; and on its return he may examine the sureties and sucn
witnesses as may be produced, touching the property of the
sureties and its value; and 1, u1)011 such exam11!at1on, h~ IS
satisfied that the bond is insufficient, he must require sufficient
additional security. . 
5732. If sufficient security be not given within the ~1f!!e
fixed by the judge's ~rder,. the right of such executor or admimstrator to the administr .. ation shall cease, and the person next 
entitled to the administration 011 the estate, who will execute 3,! 
sufficient bond, must be appointed to the admirristration. , 
5733. When it is expressly provided m the will that no. 
bond shall be required of the executor; letters tes.tamentary may, 
issue and sales of real es.tate be made and confirmed without any
bond, unless the court, for good cause, require 011e to be executed; 
but the executor may, at any t1111e afterward, if it appears from
any cause necessar .. y or proper, be requir .. ed to file a bond as in 
other cases. 
5734. A11y person interested i11 a11 estate may by verified
petition, represent to the juclge of the probate CO~l"t that the 
sureties of the executor or administrator thereof have become
or are becoming insolvent or that they have removed or ar~ 
about to r:e~ove from this territory, or that 1 .. om any other cause
the bond is 111s~1ffic1e~1t, and ask t~1at further security be required. 
. 57'!?~If the judge 18 satisfied that the matter requires
Investig'ation, a c1tat1011 must be issued to the executoror admin- 
. } 
istrator, requrrmg 11m to appear .. , at a time and place to be therein
speci~ed,. to show cause why he should not give further security. 
The c1tat1011 must be served personally 011 the executor or administrator, at least five days before the 1~et1t11"11 clay. If l1e has 
absconded, or cannot be found, it may be ser .. ved by leaving a
copy of it at his last place of residence, 01' by such publication as 
the judge may order. 

5736. 011 the return of the cite.tion, or at such other time 
. as the judge may appoint, he must p1 .. oceed to hear the proofs
and allegations of the parties. If it satisfactorily appears that 
the security is fr .. om any cause insufficient, he may make a11
order requiring the executor or admin istrator to give further 
security, or to file a new boud, in the usual form, within a reasonable time, not less than five days. 
5737. If the executor or administrator neglects to comply
with the order within the time p~ .. escribed, the judge must, by 
order, revoke his letters, and his a.uthor .. ity must thereupon cease. 
5738.. When a petition is presented praying that an executor or administrator be required to give further secur .. ity, orto 
give bond where, by the terms of the will 110 bond was originally
required, and it is alleged on oath that the executor or adminis
trator is wasting the property of the estate, the judge may, by
order, suspend his powers until the matter can be heard and 
determined. 
5739. When it comes to his knowledge that the bond of
any executor or administrator .. is, from any cause, insufficient, 
the judge of the probate court, without any applicatio11, must cite
him to appear and show cause why he should not give further 
security, and must proceed thereon as upon the application of 
any person interested.
5710. When a surety of any executor or administrator 
desires to be released from responsibility 011 account of future
aets, he rnay make application by petition to the judge of the 
probate court for relief. The judge must issue a citation to the
executor or administrator, to be served persona.lly upon him,
requiring birn to appear at a time an.d place to be therein specified,
and! give other security. If l1e has absconded, left or removed.from
the territory, or cannot be found after due diligence and inquiry,
service may be made as provided when the citation is to 1"equire 
turther security.
15 7 41. If new sureties be given to the satisfaction of the 
judge, he may thereupon make and enter an order that the sureties
who applied for relief shall not be liable on their bond for any 
subsequent act, default or rnisoontluct of the executor or administrator. 
~ 
.5'.7 42. If the executor or administrator neglects orrefuses
to. giv.:-e, new sureties, to the satisfaction of the judge; 011 the 
return of the citation, or within such reasonable time as the
judge shall allow, unless the surety making the application shall
consent to a longer extension of time, the judge must, by order 
revoke his letters. ' 
57 43. The applications authorized by the nine preceding
sections of this chapter, may be heard and determined out of 
term time; and all orders made therein must be entered upon the
minutes of the court.

<Claimant or affiant. If the claim be not due when presented, or be 
-contingent, the particulars of such claim must be stated. When
the affidavit is made by a person other than the claimant, he 
must set forth i11 the affidavit the reason why it is riot made by
the claimant. The executor or administrator may also require 
-satisfactory vouchers or proofs to be produced i11 support of
tl1e claim. If the estate is insolvent, no greater rate of interest 
-shall be allowed upon any claim, after the first publication of
111otice to creditors, than is allowed bylaw on judgments obtained 
in the district court.
5792. Whe11 it shall appear, upon the settlement of the 
accounts of any executor or administrator, that debts against
-the deceased have bee11 paid without the affidavit and allowance
'prescribed by the preceding section, and shall be proven by corn1>etent evidence to the satisfaction of the probate court that such 
-debts were justly due, were paid in good faith, that the a111ou11t
'paid was the true amount ofsuch indebtedness over and above 
-all payments or set offs, and that the estate is solvent, it shall be 
"the duty of the said court to allow the said sums so paid i11 the 
settlement of said accounts. 
5793. Any judge of the probate court may present a claim
against the estate of a decedent, for allowance, to the executor 
or administrator thereof; and if the executor or administrator 
. . . t th
-allows or rejects the claim, he must, in writing, presen e sam_e 
-to the county clerk of the county, who shall thereupon .be substi- 
-tuted in the settlement of said estate in place of the probate
judge, as provided by law, and the judge of the probate court 
presenting such claim, in case of its rejection by the executor or
.administrator, or by such county clerk, acting as juclge, has the 
-sa.me right to sue in. a pr<?per court for its recovery ~s other persons have when their claims against an estate a1"e rejected.

5794. When a claim accompanied by the a avit require 
in this chapter, is presented to the executor 01 ... administrator, he
must indorse thereon his allowance or rejection, with the day 
.and date thereof. If he allow the claim, it must be presented to
-the judge for his approval, who mu~t, in the same manner, 111- 
<lorse upon it his allowance 01-- rejection, If the executor 01' 
administrator .. , 01the judge 1 .. efuse 01' neglect to in dorse such. 
allowance 01' rejection f 01-- ten days after the claim has been presented to him, such 1 .. efusal or neglect is equivalent to a rejection 
on the tenth day; and if the presentation be made by a notary, 
the certificate of such notary, under seal, is p1 .. ima facie evidence,
of such presentation and rejection, If the claim be presented to 
the executor 01 .. administrator" befor .. e the expiration of the timelimited for the presentation of claims, the same is presented in 
time, though acted upon by the executor or administrator, arid 
by the judge, after the expiration of such time.
5795. Every claim allowed by the executor or adminis
trator, and approved by the judge, 01"' a copy thereof, as herein
after provided, must, within thirty days thereafter, be filed in 
the probate court, and be ranked among the acknowledged debts
of the estate!' to be paid i11 due course of administration. If the
claim is founded on a bond, bill, note, or any other instrument, 
a copy of such instrument must accompany the claim, and theoriginal instrument must be exhibited if demanded, unless it is 
lost or destroyed, i11 which case the claimant must accompany
his claim by his affidavit, containing a copy OP particular descrip
tion of $UCh instrument, and stating its loss or destruction. If 
the claim 01 .. any part thereof is secured by a mortgage or other 
Iien w hich has been recorded 01" filed according to law i11 theoffice of the register of deeds of the county i11 which the land 
affected by it lies, it is sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien,
and refer to the date of its filing and volume, and page of its.
record. If, i11 any case, the claimant has left any original 
voucher i11 the hands of the executor or administrator, 01' suffered,
the same to be filed in court, he may withdraw the same when 
a copy of the same has been already, or is then, attached to his. 
claim A brief description of every claim filed must be entered
by the judge in the register, showing the name of the claimant, 
the amount and character of the claim, rate of interest, and dateof allowance, 
5796. When a claim is rejected; either by the executor01" administrator, 01' the judge of the probate court, the holder
must bring suit in the proper court, to wit, before a justice of'
the peace, 01' in the district court, according to its amount, against 
the executor or administrator, within three months after the
date of its rejection, if it be then due, or within two months 
after it becomes due, otherwise tho claim is f orever barred. 
5797. No claim must be allowed by the executor 01"
administr .. ator, or by the judge, which is barred by the statute (!f 
limitations. Whe11 a claim is presented to the judge for his.
allowance, he may, in his discretion, examine the cla.imant and.
others, 011 oath, and hear any other legal evidence touching the 
validity of the claim. 
5798. No holder of any claim against an estate shall 
main tain any action thereon, unless the claim is first presented to the executor or administrator. . 
5799. The time during which there shall .be. a v.acancy !11'. 
the administration, must not be included in any l1m1tat1011 herein
prescribed. . 
5800.. If a11 action is pending against the daeedent at t11:1e
of his death, the plaintifff must i11 like manner present 111~ cl~1m
to the executor or administrator, 01" allowance or reJect10lill 
authenticated as required i11 other cases; and no recovery shal 
be had in the action unless proof be made of the presentation
requ11 .. ecl. 
5801. Whenever any claim is presented to an executor
or. a~mi11istator, or to the judge of the probate court, and he is 
willing to allow the same in part, he must state in his endorsement the amount he is willing to allow. If the creditor refuse to 
.accept the amount allowed in satisfaction of his claim he shall
recover no costs in an action therefore, brought against the exe- 
cutor or administrator, unless he recovers a greater amount than 
'that offered to be allowed.
5802. A judgment rendered against an executor or admin
istrator, in the district court or before a magistrate, upon any
-claim for money against the estate of his testator or intestate, 
-only establishes the claim i11 the same manner as if it had been
.allowed by the executor. or administrator, and the judge of the 
probate court, and the judgment must be that the executor or
administrator pay, i11 due course of administr .. ation, the amount 
.ascertained to be due, A certified transcr .. ipt of the judgment
must be filed in the probate court, No execution must issue upon 
.sucn judgment, nor shall it create any lien upon the property of
the estate, or give to the judgment creditor any priority of pay
ment. 
5803. When any judgment has been rendered for or against
-the testator or intestate i11 his life-time, no execution shall issue 
thereon after his death, except: 
1. In case of the death of the judgment creditor, upon the
.application of his executor or administrator, or successor in 
interests. 1 
2. In case of the death of the judgment debtor, if the judgment be for the recovery of real or personal property, or the 
-enforcement of a lien thereon. 
A judgment against the decedent for the recovery of money,
must be presented to the executor or administrator, like any. 
other claim. If the execution is actually levied upon any prop-erty of the decedent before his death, the same may be sold for 
the satisfaction thereof, and the officer making the sale must
account to the executor or administrator for any surplus in his 
hands. 
5804. A judgment rendered against a decedent, dying 
.after verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment 
is rendered thereon, is not a lien 011 the real property of the
-decedent, but is payable in due course of administration. 
5805. If the executor or administrator doubts the correctness of any claim presented to him, he may enter into an. agree ... 
ment, in writing, with the claimant, to refer the matter 111 controversy to some disinterested person, to be approved by the 
.judge of the probate court. Upon :filing the agreement, and
.approval of the judge of the probate court? in. the office .o~ the 
clerk of the distr .. ict court for the county or judicial subdivision 
in which the letters testamentary or of administration were
granted, the clerk must, either in vacation or in term, enter a
minute of the order referr ing the matter in controversy to the
person so selectecl; or, if the parties consent, a reference ~ay be 
had in the probate court; and the .1 .. eport of the referee, if confirmed, establishes or rejects the claim, the same as if it had been
allowed or rejected by the executor or administrator and the pro- 
bate judge. 
5806. The referee must hear and deterrnirie the matter, 
and make his report thereon to the court in which his appointment is entered, The same proceedings shall be had in all
respects, and the referee shall have the same powers, be entitled_
to the same compensation, a11~ subject to tl1e same control as in
other cases of ref erence, 'I'he court may remove the referee
appoint another in his place, set aside or confirm his report, and_
adjudge costs, as in actions against executors or administrators, 
and the juclgment of the court thereon shall be as valid and
effectual, in all respects, as if the same had been rendered in a. 
suit commenced by ordinary process. 
5807. When a judgment is recovered, with costs, against.
any executor or administrator, he .shall be individually liable for 
such costs, but they must be allowed him in his administration
accounts, unless it appears that the suit or proceeding in which.
the costs were taxed was prosecuted or defended without just 
cause. 
5808. If the executor or administrator is a creditor of the
decedent, his claim, duly authenticated by affidavits, must be
presented for allowance or rejection to the judge of theprobate
court; and its allowance by the judge is sufficient evidence of its.
correctness, and it must be paid as other claims, in due courseof
administration, If, however, the judge rejects theclaim, action
thereon may be had against the estate by the claimant, and sum
mons must be served 'upon the judge of the probate court, whomay appoint an attorney at the expense of the estate, to defend.
the action. If the claimant recover no judgment, he must pay
all costs, including defendant's attorney's fee. 
5809. If a11 executor or administrator neglect for twomonths after his appointment to give notice to creditors, as pre
scribecl by this chapter, the court must revoke h is letters, and.
appoint some other person in his stead, equally or next in order, 
entitlecl to the appointment, . 
5810. At the same term at which he is required to return
his inventory, the executor or administrator must also return a. 
statement of all claims against the estate which have been
presented to him, if so required by the court; and from term to
to term thereafter he must present a statemen t of claims subse- quently presented to him, I~ all such statements he m:1-st 
designate the names of tho creditors, the nature of each claim, 
when it became due or will become due, and whether it was . 
allowed or rejected by him. 
5811. If there be any debt of the decedent bearmg mterest,
whether presented 01" not, the executor or administrator may, 
by order of the probate court, pay tho amount the11 accumulated,
and unpaid, or any part thereof, at any time wh en there ~re
sufficient funds properly applicable thereto, whether said cla1n1.
be then due or notancl interest shall thereupon cease to accrue
upon the amount ~o paid. This section does not apply to debts 
existing at the date this law goes into effect, unless the creditor
consent to accept the amount.

be chargeable with the payment of the debts of the deceas~d the
expenses of administration, and the allowance to the fa~ily.
And the property, personal and real, may be sold as. the court
may direct, in the manner hereinafter prescribed. There shall 
be no priority as between personal and real property for tho above
purposes. 
5813. No sale of any property of an estate of a decedent
is valid unles made under order of the probate court, except
as otherwise hereinafter provided. All sales must be reported
under oath, and confirmed by the probate court, before the title 
to the property sold passes. 
. 5814. All petitio11s for orders of sale must be i11 writing,
setting forth the facts showingthe sale to be necessary, and upon 
the hearing, any person interested in the estate may file his written objections, which must be hear .. d and deter .. mined, A failure
to set forth the facts showing the sale to be necessary will not
invalidate the subsequent proceedings, if the defect be supplied
by the proofs at the hearing, and the general facts showing the 
necessity be stated i11 the order directing the sale. 
5815. When it appears to the court that the estate is 
insolvent, or that it will require a sale of all the property of the 
estate, of every character, chargeable therewith, to pay tho
family allowance, expenses of administration, and debts, there 
need be but 011e petition filed, but 011e order of sale made, and
but 011e sale hacl, except i11 cases of perishable property, which
may be sold as provided in the next section. 'I'he probate court,
when a petition for the sale of any property, for any of the pur
poses herein named, is presented, must inquire fully i11 to the
probable amount required to rnake all such payments, and if
there be no more estate chargeable therewith than sufficient to
pay the same, may require but one proceeding for the sale of the
entire available estate. 111 such case the petition must set forth 
all the facts required by section 5822. .

5816. At any time after receiving letters, the executor, 
administrator, or special administrator may apply to the judge
and obtain an order to sell perishable and other personal pro1)erty likely to depreciate in value, or which will incur loss 01"
expense by being kept, and so TUUCh other personal property a~ 
may be necessary to pay the allowance made to the f amily of
the decedent. The order for the sale may be made without
notice; but the executor, administrator or special administrator
is responsible for the property, unless, after making a sworn 
return, and on a proper showing, the court shall approve the
sale. 
01
581 7. If claims against the estate have been allowed, and
a sale of property is necessary for their payment, or the expenses
of administration, or for the payment of legacies, the executor
or administrator may apply for an order to sell so much of the
personal property as may be necessary therefore. Upon filing
his petition, notice of at least five days must be given of the 
hearing of the application, either by posting notices or by advertising. He may also make a similar application, either in vacation or term, from time to time, so long as any personal property
remains in his hands, and sale thereof is necessary. If it appear
for the best interest of the estate, he may, at any time after
filing the inventories, in like manner, and after giving like
notice, apply for and obtain an order to sell the whole of the 
personal property belonging to the estate, remaining and not set
apart, whether necessary to pay debts or not. 
5818. Partnership interests, or interests belonging to any
estate by virtue of any partnership formerly existing, interest in 
personal property pledged, and choses in action, may be sold in
the same manner as other personal property, when it appears to
be for the best interest of the estate. Before confirming the sale
of any partnership interest, whether made to the surviving part
ner or to any other person, the judge must carefully inquire into
the condition of the partnership affairs, .and must examine the 
surviving partner, if in the county and able to be present in
court. 
5819. If it appear that a sale is necessary for the payment of debts or the family allowance, or for the best interest 
of the estate, and the persons. interested in the property to be
sold, whether it is or is not necessary to pay the debts or family
allowance, the court or judge must order it to be made. In 
making orders and sales for the payment of debts or family
allowance, euch articles as are not necessary for the support and 
subsistence of the family of the decedent, or are not specially
bequeathed, must be first sold, and the court or judge must so
direct. 
5820. The sale of personal property must be made at public auction, and after public notice given for at least fifteen days, 
by notices posted in three public places in the county, or by publication i11 a newspaper, or both, containing the time and place 
of sale, and a brief description of the property to be sold; unless
for good reasons shown, the court or Judge orders a private sale, 
or a shorter notice. Public sales of such property must be made
at the court house door, or at the residence of the decedent, or at 
some other public place, but no sale shall be made of any personal
property which is not present at the time of sale, unless the court 
or judge otherwise order.

this article, or if such sale be assented to by all the persons 1nteF

debts or legacies, ~lie court must order tho remainder to be sote

made at public auction. unless, i11 the opinion of the cour.t, 1 ' 
would benefit the estate to sell the whole OI'. some p~rt i d.~~ 
real estate at pri vate sale; the court may if the same is as e 
in the petition, order or direct such real estate. or any part tl1ereof
to be sold at either .Public or private sale, , as the executor 
administrator shall J~14ge to be most beneficial for the estate. If
the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to make a sale 
under the orcler and as directed therein, he may be compelled. to
sell, by order of the court, made on motion, after due notice by 
any party interested, '
5830. If the executor ?l, administrator neglects to apply 
for any order of sale when it is necessary, any person may make
application therefore in the same 1na1111er as the executor or 
administrator, and notice thereof, must be given to the executor
or administratorvbefore the hearing. The petition of such appli
cant, must co11ta111 as ma11:y- of the matters required for the petition of the executor or administrator as he can ascertain and the
decree of sale must fix the period of time within which tl1e exec
utor or administrator must make the sale. 
.5831 .. Wl1e11 a sale is ordered, and is to be made at public
auction, notice of the time and place of sale must be posted in
three of the most public places i11 the county i11 which the land
is situated, and published in a newspaper if there be one printecl 
in the same county, but if none, t11e11 i11 such paper as the court 
may direct, for three weeks successively next before the sale. The
lands and tenements to be sold must be described with common 
certainty i11 the notice. 
5832. Sales at public auction must be made i11 the county
where the land is situated; but when the land -is situated i11 two 
or more counties, it may be sold i11 either. The sale must be
made between the hours of nine o'clock in the morning and the 
setting of the sun on the same day, and must be made on the
day named in the notice of sale, unless the same is postponed. 
5833. Whe11 a sale of real estate is ordered to be made at
private sale, notice of the same must be posted up in three of the
most public places in the county in which the land is situated, 
and published in a newspaper, if there be one printed i11 the
same county; if none, then i11 such paper as the court may 
direct, for two weeks successively next before the day 011 or
after which the sale is to be made, in which the lands and tene
ments to be solcl must be clescribecl with common certainty, .The
notice must state a day on or after which the sale will be made, 
and a place where offers or bids will be received. 'I'ho day last
referred to must be at least fifteeen days from the first publication of notice, and the sale must not be made before that day,
but mast be made within six months thereafter. The bids or 
offers must be in writing, and may be left at the place designated
in the notice, or delivered to the executor or administrator per
sonally, or may be filed in the office of the judge of the probate
court, to which the return of sale must be made, at any time
after the first publication of notice, and before the making of 
the sale. If it is shown that it will be for the best interest of
the estate, the court or judge may, by an order, shorten the time
of notice, which shall not, however, be less than one week, and 
may provide that the sale may be made on or after a day less
t~aia fifteen, but not less than eight days from the first publica
tion of the :notice, in which case the notice of sale and the sale 
may be made to correspond with such order. 
5834. Nosale of real estate at private sale shall be con
firmed by the court unless the sum offered is at least ninety per 
eeat. of the appraised value ther .. eof, nor unless such real estate 
0; 
has been appraised within one year of the time of such sale. If
it has not been so appraisecl, or if the court is satisfied that the
appraisement is too high 01' too low, appraisers must be appointed 
and they must make an appraisement thereof in the same man:
ner as i11 case of an original appraisement of an estate. This 
may be done at any time before the sale or the confirmation
thereof. 
5835. The executor or administrator must, when the sale
is made 11pon a credit, take the notes of the purchaser for the
purchase money with a mortgage on the property to secure their
payment. 
5836. The executor or administrator, after making any
sale of real estate, must .make a return of his proceedings to the 
probate court, which must be filed by the judge, at anv time subsequent to the sale, either in term or vacation. If the sale be
macle at public auction, and the return is made and filed on or
before the first day of the next term thereafter, no notice is
requirecl of such return or of the hearingthereof, but the bearing
may be hacl upon the first day of the term, or any subsequent
day to which the same may be postponed, If the sale be not 
made at public auction, or if made at public auction a hearing
upon the return of proceedings be asked for in the return, 01' is
brought on for a hearing upon a day before the first day of the 
next term ther .. eafter, or 11pon any other day than the first day of
the next term after such sale, the court or judge 'must fix the day
for the hearing, of which notice of at least ten days must be
given by the judge, by notices posted i11 three public places in 
the county, or by publication in a newspaper, or both, as he may
deem best, and must briefly indicate the land sold, the sum for
which it was sold, and must refer to the return for further par
ticulars. Upon the hearing the court must examine the return
and witnesses in relation to the same, and if the proceedings 
were unfair, or the sum bid disproportionate to the value, and if 
it appear that a sum exceeding such bid at least ten per cent.,
exclusive of the expenses of a new sale, may be obtained, the 
court may vacate the sale and direct another to be had, of which
notice must be given, and the sale in all respects conducted as if 
no previous sale had taken place; if an offer ten per cent. m0!e 
in amount than that named in the return be made to the court in
writing, by a responsible person, it is in the discretion of the 
court to accept such offer and confirm the sale to such person or
to order a new sale. 
583 7. When return of the sale is made and filed, any p@rson interested in the estate may file written objections to the 
confirmation thereof, and may be heard thereon when. the return
is heard by the court or judge, and may produce witnesses in 
support of his objections. ' 
5838. If it appear to the court that the sale was legtl~
made and fairly conducted, and that the sum bid was not 
proportionate to the value of the proper'ty sold, and that .a great:x
sum, as above specified, cannot be obtained, or if the 1ncreas t 
bid mentioned in section 5836 be made and accepted ~y the co~I '
the court must makean order confirming the sale, an?- d1r.ec~~~~ 
conveyances to be executed. The sale, from that tun.fl,
1~ 
firmed and valid, and a certified copy of the order con rrr:;:J' in 
and directing conveyances to be executed must b~ reco~ch the
the office of the register of deeds of the county within whichaser 
land sold is situated. If after the confirmation the pur 
8 
tr it 

neglects or refuses to comply with the terms of sale the court 
may, on motion of the executor or administrator, and a'fter notice 
to the purchaser, order a resale to be made of the pr .. operty. If 
the amount realized on such resale does not cover the bid and
the expenses of the previous sale, such purchaser is liable for the 
deficiency to the estate. 
5839. Conveyances must ther .. eupon be executed to the
purchaser by the executor or administrator, and they must refer
to the orders of the probate court authorizing and confirming the 
sale of the property of the estate, and directing conveyances
thereof to be executed, and to the record of the order of confirm .. 
ation in the office of the register of deeds, by the date, volume
and page of the record, and such reference shall have the same 
effect as if the orders were at large inserted in the conveyance.
Conveyances so made convey all the right, title, interest and
estate of the decedent, in the premises, at the time of his death;
if, prior to the sale, by operation of law 01~ otherwise, the
estate has acquired any right, title or interest in the premises, 
other than, or in addition to, that of the decedent at the time of
his death, such right, title or interest also passes by such convey
ance. 
5840. Before any order is entered confirming the sale, it
must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that notice was 
given of the sale as prescribed, and the order of confirmation
must show that such proof was made. 
5841. If, at the time appointed for the sale, the executor 
or administrator deems it for the interest of the persons concerned therein that the same be postponed, he may postpone it 
from time to time, not exceeding in all three months. 
5842. In case of a postponement, notice thereof must be 
given, by a public declaration, at the time and place first
appointed for the sale, and if the postponement be for more than 
one day, further notice must be given by posting notices in three 
or more public places in the county where the land is situated,
or publishing the same, or both, as the time and circumstances 
will admit. 
5843. If the testator makes provisions by his will or designates the estate to be appropriated for the payment of his debts, 
the expenses of administration, or family expenses, they must
be paid according to such provisions or designation, out of the 
estate thus appropriated, so far as the same is sufficient. 
5844. When property is directed by the will to be sold, or
authority is given in the will to sell property, the executor may
sell any property of the estate without the "order of the nrobate 
court, and at either public or private sale, and with or without
notice, as the executor may determine; but the executor must
make return of such sales as in other cases; and if directions are
given in the will as to the mode of selling, or the particular 
property to be sold, such directions must be observed. I11 either
case no title passes unless the sale is con.firmed by the court. 
5845. If the provision made by the will, or the estate appropriated therefore, is insufficient to pay the debts, expenses of 
aidm.inis_tration, and family exp_ens~s, that portion of the e?tate 
Dot devised or disposed of by will, if any, must be appropriated
and disposed of for that purpose according to the p1 .. ovisions of 
this article. 
5845. The estate, real and personal, given by wil_l .to
legatees or devisees, is liable for the debts, expenses of adminis- 
tration, and family expenses, in proportion to the value or
amount of the several clevises or legacies, but specific devises or 
legacies are exempt from such Iiabi lity if it appears to the court 
necessary to carr .. y into effect the intention of the testator, and
there is othersufficient estate. 
584 7. When an estate given by will has been sold for the 
payment of debts or expenses, a.1.1 the devisees and legatees 
must contribute accordingto their respective interests to the 
devises 01~ legatee whose devise or legacy has been taken therefor, and the probate court, when distribution is made, must, 'by 
clecree for that purpose, settle the amount of the several liabilities, and decree the amount each person shall contribute and 
reserve the same from their distributive shares respectively, for 
t lie pur .. po e of paying such contribution. 
5848. If a decedent, at the time of his death, was possessed of a contract for the purchase of land, his interests in such 
laud and under such contracts may be sold on the application
of his executor or administrator, in the same manner as if he had 
died seized of such lancl, and the same proceedings may be had
for that purpose as are prescribed in this chapter for the sale' of 
lands of which he died seized, except as hereinafter provided. 
5849. The sale must be made subject to all payments that 
may hereafter become due on such contracts, and if there are
any such the sale must not be confirmed by the probate court until the purchaser's execute a bond to the executoror administra
tor, for the benefit and indemnity of himself and of the persons
entitled to the interest of the decedent in the lands so contracted 
for, in double the whole amount of payments thereafter to become due on such contract, with such sureties as the probate 
judge shall approve. 
5850. The bond must be conditioned that the purchaser
,, r: ill make a.11 payments for such land that become due after the 
date of the sale, and will fully Indemnify the executor' or admin
istrator and the per .. sons so entitled against all demands, costs, 
charges and expenses by reason of any covenant or agreement
contained in such contract. 
5851. U pen the confirmation of the sale, the executor or
administrator must execute to the purchaser an asaig nment of 
the contract, which vests in the purchaser, his heirs and assigns,
all the right, title arid interest of the estate, or' of the persons 
entitled to the interest of the decedent in the lands sold at the
time of the sale aud the purchaserhas the same rights and 
remedies against the vendor of such land as the decedent would
have had if he were Ii ving, . . 
5852. When any sale is made by an executor or adm1U1S ... 
trator, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, of lands 
subject to any mortgage orother . lien, which is a valid claim
azainst the estate of the decedent, and has been presented and
allowed, the purchase money must be applied, after pa,)-iugt~e 
necessary expenses of the sale fu .. st to tl1~ payment and sat1s
faction of the mortgage or lien, aJJ d the residue, 1f a11.3", in due
course of administration. The application . of the purch.a~: 
money to the satisf action of the mortgage or lien must be ma
,vit1?-ol1t delay; and the land is subject to such mortgage or l~~ 
until the pur .. chase money has been actually so a.pplied. ,1 d
claim asrainst any estate which has been presen ted and allo~e
is affected bv the statute of limitations, pendingthe p1"oceedings 
forthe settlement of the estate. The purchase money, 
01so 
much thereof as may be sufficien t to l)ay such rnortgage orlien
with interest, and any lawful costs and. charges thereon, may b~ 
paid 111to the pr .. obate court, to be received by the judge thereof',
whereupon the mor'tgage or lien upon the land must cease and 
-the purchase money must be paid over .. by the judge withot1t
-delay, in payment of the expenses of the sale and in satisfaction 
-of the debt, to secure which the mortgage or other lien was
taken, and the surplus, if any, at 011.ce returned to the executor 
--01' administr .. ator, unless, for good cause shown, after notice to
i,l1e executor 01" administrator, the judge otherwise directs. 
5853. At any sa~e under order of the probate court, of
lands upon which there is a mortgage or l1e11, .the holder thereof 
.may become the purchaser, and his receipt for the amount due
him from the proceeds of the sale is a payment p1'0 tanto. If 
the amount for which 11.e purchased the property is insufficient to
-defray the expenses and discharge his mortgage 01 .. Iien, lie must 
pay to the judge an amount sufficient to l)ay such expenses. 
5854. If there is any neglect or miscond uct i11 the pro-ceedings of the executor or administrator i11 relation to any sale, 
. thy which any person interested in the estate suffers damage, the
:party aggrieved may recover the same in an action upon the 
-bond of the executor or administrator, or otherwise. 
5855. Any executor or administrator ,,110 fraudulently
.sells any real estate of a decedent, contrary to or otherwise than 
-under the provisions of this chapter, is liable in double the value
-of the land sold, as liquidated damages, to be recoverecl in an 
.action by the person having a11 estate of inheritance therein.
5856. No action for the recovery of any estate sold by a11 
executor or administrator, under the provisions of this chapter, 
can be maintaind by any heir or other person claiming
under the decedent, unless it be commenced within three years 
next after the sale. An action to set aside the sale may be
.instituted and maintained at any time with in three years from
rthe discovery of the fraud or other grounds upon which the 
action is based.
5857. The preceding sectionshall not apply to minors, or 
others under any legal disability to sue at the time when the
right of action first accrues; but all such persons may commence 
an action at any time within three years after the removal of the
disability. 
5858. When a sale has been made by an executor or
administrator, of any property of the estate, real or personal, he 
must return to the probate court, at its next term thereafter,

5863. Any person, or his personal representatives, may
maintain an action against the executor or administrator of any 
testator or intestate who in his lifetime had wasted, destroyed,
taken, or carried away, or converted to his own use, the goods or 
chattels of any such person or committed any trespass on the
real estate of such person. 
5864. ~hen a partnership exists between the decedent, at. 
the time of his death, and any other person, the surviving

actions on the bond of a11 executor, or of any former 'admi11i11istrator of the same estate. 
5866. In actions by or against executors, it is not necessary to join those as parties to whom letters were issued but
who have not qualified. ' 
!5867. Whenever a debtor. or a decedent is unable to pay 
all his debts, the. executor or administrator, with the approbation
of the probate judge, may compound with him, and give him a
discharge upon receiving a fair and just dividend of his effects.
A compromise may also be authorized, when it appears to be
just, and for the best interest of the estate. 
5868. When there is a deficiency of assets in the hands of
an executor or administra tor .. , and w l1e11 the decedent, in his
life ... time, has conveyed any real estate, or any rights 01 .. interests
therein, with intent to defraud his creditors, or to avoid any
right, debt or duty of any person, 01-- has so conveyed such estate
that by law the deeds or conveyances are void as against creditors, the executor or administrator must commence and prosecute to :final judgment any propel" action for the recovery of the 
same; and may recover for the benefit of the creditors all such
real estate so fraudulently conveyed; and may also, for tho bene- 
fit of the creditors, sue and recover all goods, chattels, rights or

5871. When a person who is bound by contract in writing
to convey any real estate, dies. before making the conveyance, 
and in all cases when such decedent, if living, might be com- 
pelled to make such conveya.nce, the probate court may make a
decree authorizing and directing his executor or administrator 
to convey such real estate to the person 'entitled thereto. 
5872. 011 the presentation of a verified petition by any
person claiming to be entitled to such conveyance from an 
executor or administrator, setting forth the facts upon which the
claim is pr .. edicated, the probate judge must appoint a time and
place for hearing the petition, at a regular term of court, and
must order notice thereof to be published at least four successive 
weeks before such hearing, in such newspaper in this territory
as he may designate. 
5873. At a time and place appointed for the hearing, or
at such other time to which the same may be postponed, upon
satisfactory proof, by affidavit or otherwise, of the due publica ..
tion of the notice, the court must proceed to a hearing, and all
persons interested in the estate may appear and contest such 
petition, by filing their objections in writing, and the court may
examine, on oath, the petitioner and all who may be produced
before him for that purpose . 
587 4. If, after a full hearing upon the petition and objecexamination of the facts and circumstances of the 
claim, the court is satisfied that the petitioner is entitled to a
conveyance of the real estate described in the petition, a decree 
authorizing and directing the executor or administrator to
execute a conveyance thereof to the petitioner must be made, 
entered on the minutes of the court, and recorded.
5875. The exe.cutor or administrator must execute the 
conveyance according to the directions of the decree, a certified
copy of which must be recorded with the deed in the office of the
register of deeds of the county where the lands lie, and is prima 
facie evidence of the correctness of the proceedings and of the
authority of the executor or administrator to make the convey
ance. 
5876. If, upon hearing i11 the probate court, as hereinbefore provided, the right of the petitioner to have a specific
performance of the contract is found to be doubtful, the court 
must dismiss the petition without prejudice to the rights of the
petitioner, who may, at any time within six months thereafter, 
proceed in the clistrict court to enforce a specific performance
thereof, 
5877. Every conveyance made in pursuance of a decree 
of the probate court, as provided in this chapter, shall pass ~ 1e 
title to the estate contracted for as fully as if the contracting
party himself was still living and executed the conveyance. 
5878. A copy of the decree for a conveyance, made by 
the probate court, and duly certified and recorded i11. _tl1e office of
the register of deeds of the county w!1ere the lands lie, _gives the 
person entitled to the conveyance a right to the p_ossess1on of the
lands contracted for, and to hold the same according to the terms 
of the conveyance, i11 like manner as if they had been conveyed
in pu1~sua11ce of the decree. . . . 
5879. The recording of any decree; as provided 111 the
preceding section, shall not prevent the court making the decree 
from enf orcing the same by other process. .

the commencement of proceedings therefore under this cbaJ?ted 
or before the completion of the corrveya.noe, any person ent1t~e
to succeed to his rights in the contract, orthe executor or admin-

upon 011 the settlement of any f ormer account, or on rendering an.
exhibit, or on making a decree of sale, may be contested by theheirs for cause shown. 'The hearing and allegations of the respec

and the court may appoint 011e or more referees to examine the. 
accounts and make report thereon, subject to confirmation; and
may allow a reasonable compensation to the referees, to be paid
out of the estate of the decedent. 
5904. The settlement of the account and the allowance, 
thereof by the court, or upon appeal, is conclusive against all per
sons i11 any way interested i11 the estate, saving, however, to all per .. 
son laboring under any legal disability, their right to move for-cause to reopen and examine the account, OI"' to proceed by 
action against the executor or administrator, either individuallyor upon his boud, at any time before final distribution; and in 
any action brought by any such person, the allowance and settle .. - 
ment of such account is prima facie evidence of its correctness.
5905. The account must not be allowed by the court until 
it is first proved that notice has been given as 1 .. equired by this.
chapter, a11d the decree must show that such proof was made to
the satisfaction of the court, and is conclusive evidence of thefact.

_5909. The preference given i11 the p1 .. eceding section to a
mortgage 011ly extends to the pr .. oceeds of the p1 .. oper .. ty mort- 
gaged, If the proceeds of such property be insufficient to pay
the mortgage, the part remaining unsatisfied must be classed 
with other demands against the estate.
5910. If the estate be insufficient to pay all the debts of 
any one class, each creditor must be paid a dividend i11 proportion to his claim: and no creditor of any class shall receive any 
payment until all those of the preceding class are fully paid. 
5911. The executor or administrator, as soon as he has
sufficient funds i11 his hands, must pay the funeral expenses, and 
the expenses of the last sickness, and the allowance made to the
family of the decedent. He may retain in his hands the neces
sary expenses of administration, but he is not obliged to pay
any other debt or any legacy until, as prescribed in this article, 
the payment has been ordered by the court.
5912. Upo11 the settlement of the accounts of the executor 
or administrator, at the end of the year, as required i11 this
chapter, the court must make a11 order for the payment of the
debts, as the circumstances of the estate require. If there be not
sufficient funds in the hands of the executor or administrator, the
court must.specify in the decreethe sum to be paid to each creditor. If the whole assets of the estate be exhausted by such
payment or distribution, such account must be considered as a
final account, and the executor or administrator is entitled to his
discharge on producing and filing the necessary vouchers and
proofs, showing that such payments have been made, and that he 
has fully complied with the decree of the court.
5913. If there is any claim not due, or any contingent 
or disputed claim against the estate, the amount thereof, or such
part of the same as the holder would be entitled to if the claim
were due, established or absolute, must be paid into the court,
and there remain, to be paid over to the party when he becomes 
entitled thereto; or, if 11 e fails to establish his claim, to be paid
over or distributed as the circumstances of the estate require, 
If any creditor whose claim has been allowed, but is not yet clue,
appears and assents to a deduction therefrom of the legal interest
for the time the claim has yet to run, he is entitled to be paid
accordi11gly. The payments provicled for i11 this section are not
to be made when the estate is insolvent, unless a pro rata clis
tribution is ordered.
5914. Whe11 a decree is made by the probate court for the 
payment of creditors, the executor or administrator is personally 
\ . 
liable to each creditor for his allowed claim, or the dividend
thereon, ancl execution may be issued on such decrees, as upon
judgment in the district court, in favor of each creditor, and the
same proceeding may be had under such execution as if it had
been issued from the district court. The executor or administrator is liable therefore, on his bond, to each creditor . 
5915. When the accounts of the administrator or executor
have been settled, and an order made for the payment of debts
and distribution of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not
included in the order for payment, has any right to call upon the
creditors who have been paid, 01-- upon the heirs, devisees, or
legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim;but if the 
executor 01 .. administrator has failed to give the notice to creditors
as required in the first ancl second sections of chapter 6, such
creditor may recover on the bond of the executor or administrator the amount of his clairn, or such part thereof as he would
have been entitled to had it been allowed. This section shall not 
apply to any creditor whose claim was not due ten months before
the day of settlement, or whose claim was contingent and did
not become absolute ten months before such day. 
5916. If the whole of the debts have been paid by the first
clistribution, the court must direct the payment of legacies 
and the distribution of the estate among the heirs, legatees, or
other persons entitled as provided in the next chapter; but if 
there be debts remaining unpaid, or, if, for other reasons, the
estate be not in a proper condition to be closed, the court must
give such extension of time as may be reasonable for a final set
tlement of the estate. 
591 7. At the time designated in the last section, or sooner,
if within that time all the property of the estate has been sold, 
or there are sufficient funds in his hands for the pay merit of all
debts due by the estate, and the estate be in a proper condition to 
be closed, the executor or administrator must render a final
account, and pray a settlement of his administration. 
5918. If he neglect to render his account, the same proceeclings may be had" as prescribed in this chapter in regard to 
the first account to be rendered by him; and all the provisions of
this chapter relative to the last mentioned account, and the notice 
and settlement thereof, apply to his account presented for final
settlement.

application, or any other heir, devisee 01" legatee may make a 
-similar application for himself, 
5922. If at the hearing it appears that the estate is but
little indebted, and that the share of the party applying may be 
allowed to him without loss to the creditors of the estate the
court must make an order in conformity with the prayer of the 
.applicant, requiring: 
1. Each heir, legatee or devisee obtaining such order, before
receiving his share or any portion thereof, to execute and cleliver
to the executor or administrator a bond, in SL1ch sum as shall be 
-designated by the probate judge, with sureties to be approved by
'the judge, payable to the executor or administrator, ancl conditioned for the payment, w henever required, of his proportion of
'the debts due from the estate, not exceeding the value or amount
-of the legacy or portion of the estate to which he is entitled. 
2. The executor or administrator to deliver to the heir, legaiee or devisee the whole portion of the estate to which he may 
be entitled, or only a part thereof, designating it.

'the manner hereinafter prescribed. The costs of these proceed
ings to b(e paid by the applicant, or if there be more than one, to
:be apportioned equally amongst them. 
5923. When any bond has been executed and delivered,
under the provisions of the preceding section, and it is necessary
'for the settlement of the estate to require the payment of any
'part of the money thereby secured, the executor or administrator
must petition the court for an order requiring the payment, and 
have a citation issued and served on the party bound, requiring
him to appear and show cause why the order should not be made.
At the heating, the court, if satisfied of the necessity of such pay- 
'ment, must make an order accordingly, designating the amount
-and.giving a time within which it must be paid. If the m~ney 
be not paid within the time allowed, an action may be maintained 
'by the executor or administrator on the bond.

5929.. When the estate, real or personal, assigned by tho
decree of distribution ~o ~wo 01-- more heirs, clevisees 01' legatees,
is in common and undivided, ancl t~1~ respective shares are 
separated and distinguished, partition 01" dietr'ibu tion may be
made by three disinterested persons, to be appointed commis
sioners for that pl1rpos~ by theprobato court ~r Judge, who must
be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of tl1e1r duties. A certi
fied copy of the order of their appointment, and of the order or
decree assigning and distributing the estate, must be issued to
them as their warrant, and their oath must be indorsed thereon,
Upon consent of the parties, or when the court deems it proper 
and just, it is sufficient to appoint one commissioner only, who
has the same authority, and is governed by the same rules as if 
three were appointed. 
5930. Such partition may be orclered and had i11 the probate court, 011 the petition of any person interested. But before 
commissioners ar~ appointed, ~1' _partiti~n ordered by the probate
court as directed in this subdi vision, notice thereof must be given 
to all persons interested, who reside in this territory, 01-- their
guardians, and to the agents, attorneys, or guardians, if any in
this territory, of such as reside out of the territory, either per .. 
sonally 01'" by public notice, as the probate court may direct.
The petition may be filed, attorneys, guardians and agents ap
pointed and notice gi ven, at any time before the order or decree
of distribution, but the commissioners must not be appointed 
until the order or decree is made distributing the estate.
5931. If the real estate is i11 different counties, the pro
bate court may, if deemed proper, appoint commissioners for all,
or differ .. ent commissioners for each county. The whole estate,
whether i11 one or more counties, shall be divided among the 
heirs, devisees, or 'legatees as if it were all in 011e county, and
the commissioners must, unless otherwise directed by the p1"0bate court, make division of such real estate, wherever situated 
within this territory. 
5932. Pa1 .. tition or distribution -of the real estate may be
made as provided in this chapter, although some of the 01 .. iginal
heirs, legatees, or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other 
.persons, and such shares must be assigned to the person holding 
the same, in the same manner as they otherwise would have
been to such heirs, legatees, or devisecs. 
5933. When both distribution and partition are made,
the several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out
to each individual in proportion to his right, by metes and
bounds, or description, so that the same can be easily distin ..
guished, unless two or more of the parties interested consent to 
have their shares set out so as to be held by them in common
and undi vided. 
5934. When the real estate cannot be divided without
prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, the probate court may 
assign the whole to one or more of the parties entitled to shares
therei11, who will accept it, always preferring the males to the
feinales, and among children pref erring the elder to the younger.
fhe parties accepting the whole must pay to the other parties 
ln.terested their just proportion of the true value thereof, or secure the same to their satisfaction; or, i11 case of the minority of 
saeh party .. then to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true
value of the estate must be ascertained and reported by the com
missioners. When the commissioners appointed to make par- 
110t 
tition are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be divided 
without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, they must so 
report to court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as 
herein provided, and must find and report the true value of such
real estate. On filing the report of the commissioners, and on
making 01" securing the payment as before provided, the court
if it appears just and proper, must confirm the report and there: 
upon the assignment is complete, and the title to the whole of
such real estate vests in the person to whom the same is so 
assigned, 
5935. Whe11 any tract of Jand or tenement is of greater
value than any 011e's share in the estate to be divided, and cannot 
be divided without injury to the same, it may be set off by the 
commissioners appointed to make IJa1 .. tition to any of the parties
who will accept it, giving preference as prescribed in the preced .. 
111g section. 'I'he party accepting must pay or secure to the 
others such sums as the commissioners shall a ward to make the 
partition equal, and the commissioners must make their award
accordingly; but such partition must not be established by the 
cour .. t until the sums a warded are paicl to the parties entitled to 
the same, or secured to their satisfaction, 
5936. Whe11 it appears to the court, from the commis ..
sioners' report, that it cannot be otherwise fair .. ly divided, and 
should be sold, the court may order the sale of the whole or any
part of the estate, real or personal, by the executor or adminis .. 
trator, or by a commission appointed for that purpose, and the
proceecls distributed. 'I'he sale must be conducted, reported and 
confirmed in tho same manner and under the same requirements 
as provided i11 article 3, chapter 7 of this code. 
5937. Before any partition is made, or any estate divided,
as providecl i11 this chapter, notice must be given to all persons
interested i11 the partition, their guardians, agents or attorneys, 
by the commissioners, of the time and place when and where
they shall proceed to make partition. The commissioners may 
take testimony, 01--de1" surveys, and take such other steps as may 
be necessary to enable thorn to form a judgment upon the matters before them. 
5938. The commissioners must report their proceedi11g:s,
and the par .. tition agreed upon by them, to the pr .. obate court, in 
writing, and the court may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the 
report and commit the same to the same commissioners, or 
appoint others; and when such report is finally conflrmed, a 
certified copy of the judgment 01'" decree of partition made 
thereon, attestecl by the judge, under the se!l,l of the court, must
be recorded i11 the office of tl.1e register of deeds of the county 
where the lancls lie. ~ 
5939. Wl1e11 the probate court makes a judgment or
decree assigning the residue of any estate to 011:e or mo1"~ p~rso1:s 
entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint comm1ss1?11eis
to make partition or distribution thereof, unless the part1esh t1 
whorn the assignment is decreed, or some of them, request t a 
such partition be made. ~ d

to have been made by the dooedeut to his heirs, may b~ hed!

~By executing and filing within the time limited in the pre
ceding section, such bond as is required in the following sections.
It shall not be necessary to notify or summon the appelleo or
respondent to appear in the district court, but such respondent
shall be taken and held to have notice of such appeal in the same 
manner as he had notice of the pendency of the proceedings in
the probate court. 
5967. The appeal bond shall be in such sum as the judge 
of the probate court shall require and deem sufficient, with at
. least two sufficient sureties to be approved by the judge, condi
tioned that the appellant will prosecute his appeal withdue diligence to a determination, and will abide, fulfill and perform
whatever judgment, decree or order may be rendered against 
him in that proceeding by the district court, and that he will pay
all damages which the opposite party may sustain by reason of
such appeal, together with all costs that may be adjudged 
against him.
5968. If the judgment, decree or order appealed from be 
for, or direct, the payment of money, or the delivery of any
property, or grant leave to issue an execution, the appeal shall 
not stay the execution thereof, unless the appeal bond be furthermore conditioned to the effect that if the judgment, decree or
order, or any part thereof be affirmed, or the appeal be dismissed, 
the appellant shall pay the sum so directed to be paid or levied,
or, as the case may require, shall deliver the property so directed
to be delivered, or the part thereof as to which the judgment,
decree or order shall be affirmed.

appeal be dismissed, the appellant shall, within twenty days
after such affirmance or dismissal, surrender himself in obedience 
to the judgment, decree or order, to the custody of .the sheriff to
whom he was committed. If the condition of such bond be 
violated, it may be prosecutecl in the same manner and with the
same effect as an administrator's official bond; and the proceeds of
the action must be paid or distributed, as directed by the probate

pecuniary injuries sustained by them, and the balance, if any,
must be paid into the county treasury. (\

tory. When it is brought in the name of the territory, the 
damages collected must be paid 'over to the probate court, and 
therein distributed as justice may require. 
5972. A11 appeal f1"01n a decree or order admitting a 
will to probate, or granting letters testamentary, 01-- letter .. s of
administration', does not stay the issuing of' letters where, i11 the 
opinion of the probate judge, manifested by an entry upon the 
minutes of the court, the preservation of tl1e estate requires that
such letters should issue. But the letters so issued do not confer 
power to sell real property by virtue of any provision in the will,
or to pay or satisfy legacies or to distribute the. property of the 
decedent among the next of kin, until the final determination of
the appeal. 
5973. An appeal from a decree or order revoking probate of a will, letter .. s testamentary, letters of administration or

may file amendments, The proposed statement and amendments ml1st. be settled by the justice, and if 110 amendments be
filed the original st_atement stands ~s adopted. The statement 
thus adopted ~r a_s settled by the .justice, with a copy of the
docket of the Jt1st1ce., and all mot1~ns fl1ed with hirn by the 
parties duririg the trial and tl1~ notice of appeal, may be used
on the hearing of the appeal before the district court . 
. 6131. Wl1e11 a pa~ty appeals to the district court on questions of fact .. or on questions of both law and fact and demands 
in his notice of appeal a new trial in the clist1"ict court, no
statement must be made, but the action must be tried anew i11
that court. 
6132. Upon receiving the notice of appeal, and 011 payment of ?ne dollar for the return of the justice, and filing an 
undertaking as required m the next section, and after settlemerit or adoption of statement, if any, the justice must within 
five days transmit to the clerk of the district, if the appeal be on
questions of fact or both law and fact, and a new trial in the 
district c~urt be demanded in the notice of appeal, a certified 
copy of his docket, the pleadings, all notices, motions and other
papers filed in the cause, the notice of appeal and the undertaking 
filed; in. all other cases a certified copy of his docket, tho statement as admitted or as settled, the notice of appeal and the
undertaking filed; and the justice may be compelled by the 
district court, by an order entered, upon motion, to transmit
such papers, and may be fined for neglect or refusal to transmit 
the same. A certified copy of such order may be served on the
justice by tl1e party. or his attorney. In the district court either
:party may have the benefit of all legal objections made in the 
Justice's court.
6133. An appeal from a justice's court is not effectual for 
any purpose, unless an undertaking be filed, with two or more
sureties, in the sum of one hundred dollars, for the payment of
the costs on the appeal; or, if a stay of proceedings be rlaimed, 
in a sum equal to twice the amount of the judgment, i.icluding 
costs, when the judgment is for the payment of moneyor twice
the value of the property, including costs, when the judgment is
for the recovery of specific personal property, and must be conditioned, when the action is for the recovery of money, that the
appellant will pay the amount of the judgment appealed from
and all costs, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, or the 
amount of any judgment and all costs that may be recovered
against him. in the action in the clistrict court. When the action 
is for the recovery of' specific personal property the undertal{ing 
must be conditioned that the appellant will pay the judgment
and costs appealed from, and obey the order of the court made 
therein, if the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed, _or a1:iy judgment and costs that may be recovered against him m said action
in the district court, and will obey any order made by the court
therein. A deposit of the ~mount of the judgment, including all 
costs appealed from, or of the value of the property, including
al! costs in actions for the recovery of specific personal property, 
with the Justice is equivalent to the f1l111g of the undertaking',
and in such ca~es the justice must transmit the money to the
clerk of the district court, to be by him paid out on the order of 
the court. The adverse party may except to the sufficiency of 
the sureties within five days after the filing of the undertaking, and unless they or other sureties justify before the 
justice before whom the appeal is taken, within five days thereafter, upon notice to the adverse party, to the amounts stated in
their affidavits, the appeal must be regarded as if no such undertaking l1ad been given, 
6134. In Judgments for the delivery of possession in
actions of forcible entry and detainer, or detainer only, the execution of the same can not be stayed unless a written undertaking
be executed on the part of the appellant, with two or mote sureties,
to the effect that during the possession of such property by the
appellant he will not commit or suffer to be committed any waste
thereon, and that if the judgment be affirmed, or the appeal be
dismissed, he will pay all rents for the use and occupation of the
property, and all damages from the time of the appeal until the
clelivery of the possession thereof. 
6135. If an execution be issued, on the filing of the undertaking staying proceedings, the justice must, by order, direct 
the officer to stay all proceedings on tl1e same. Such officer
must, upon payment of his fees for services rendered on the execution, thereupon relinquish all property levied upon, and deliver
the same p the ~udg1nent debtor, together with all monies colle:ted from .iales or otherwise. If his fees be not paid, the officer 
may retain much of the property or proceeds thereof as may
be necessary to pay the same. 
613 . Upon an appeal heard upon a statement of the case,
the district, court may review all orders affecting the judgment 
appealed from, and may set aside, affirm or modify the judgment, or any or all the proceedings subsequent. to and dependent
upon such judgment, and may, if necessary or proper, order a
new trial. When the action is tried anew, upon appeal, the
trial must be conducted in all respects as trials in the district 
court. The provisions of the code of civil procedure as to changing tho place of trial, and all the provisions as to trials in the 
district court, are applicable to trials on appeal in that court.
For a failure to prosecute an appeal, or unnecessary delay in 
bringing it to a hearing, the district court, after notice, may
orclor the appeal to be dismissed. J udgments rendered in the 
district court on appeal, have the same force and effect, and
may be enforced in the district court in the same manner, as 
juclgments in actions commenced therein, except that when a
new trial is granted the case must be remanded, and the new
nrial chall be had in the justice's court. No noti~e of. trial and 
note of issue shall be required to be. served or filed 111. or~er.to
brine the cause appealed upon the trial calendar in the district 
court, but said appeal shall be filed by the clerk, on payment of
his costs, and entered upon the calendar, and shall stand for 
trial as soon as the same is reached in the regular call of the cal
endar thereafter. If not so filed within :fifteen days from t~e
time such appeal was perfected, then the same sha.ll be dis
missed by the order of the court at a;y t1~e thereafter, upon
motion of the appellee, after three days notice to the appellant 
.or his attorney.
