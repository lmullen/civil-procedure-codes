ges u shall be awarded against the said --, bis heirs, execu­
tors or administrators, in any suit or suits which may hereafter

th1i1 cause, then the above obligation to be, void, otherwise to
remain in full force and effect. 
SEC. 6. In all cases where two or more persons are jointly in­
debted, either as partners or otherwise, and an affidavit shall be
filed, as provided in the first section of this chapter, so as to
bring one or more of such joint debtors within its provisions
and amenable to the process of attachment, then the writ of
attachment shall issue against the property and effects of such 
as are so brought within the provisions of this chapter; and
the officer shall also be directed, in said writ, to summon all such 
joint debtors as may be named in the affidavit filed in the cause,
to answer to the said action, as in other cases of attachment. 
SEC. 7. It shall be sufficient in all cases of attachment, to
designate defendants by their reputed names or surnames, and
joint defendants by their separate or partnership names, styles 
or titles, as they are usually known, and heirs, executors and
administrators or deceased defendants shall ho subject to the
provisions of this chapter, in all cases in which it may be appli­
cable to them. 
SEC. 8. No writ of attachment shall be quashed nor the prop­
erty taken thereon restored, nor any garnishee discharged, nor
any bond by him given, cancelled, nor any rule entered against
the sheriff, discharged on account of any insufficiency of the
original affidavit, writ or attachment, or attachment bond, ii the
plaintifff or some credible person for him, shall cause a legal
and sufficient affidavit or attachment bond to be filed, or the 
writ to be amended in such time and manner as the courts shall
in their discretion direct, and in that event, the cause shall pro­ 
ceed as if such proceedings had been originally sufficient. 
SEC. 9. The officer serving the writ, shall take and retain the 
custody and possession of the property attached, to answer and
abide by the judgment of the court, unless the defendant or
person in whose possession the same may be found," shall enter
into bonds and security to the officer, to be approved by him,
in double the value of the property so attached, with cendition
that the said estate and property shall be forthcoming, to
answer the judgment of the court in the said suit; the sheriff
shall return such bond to the court in which the suit is brought,
on the first day of the term to which such attachment is return­
able. 
SEC. 10. If such bond be forfeited, the sheriff may6 assign
such bond to the plaintifff in the attachment, by a writing there­
on, under his hand, in the presence of two or more credible
witnesses, and after such assignment, the plaintifff may bring a 
suit in his own name thereupon; if the plaintifff will not accept
such assignment of such bond, and the court shall adjudge such
security insufficient, such sheriff shall be subject to the same
judgment and recovery, and have the same liberty of defense, as if 
he had been made defendant in the attachment, unless good and 
sufficient security shall be given, and bond filed, during the
term of the court to which such attachment is returnable;
at which term, the objections to the sufficiency of the security 
taken shall be made, to entitle the party suing out the attach­
ment to proceed against the sheriff, and execution may issue
thereupon, as in other cases of judgment; and whenever the
judgment of the plaintifff, or any part thereof, shall be paid or
satisfied by any such sheriff, he shall have the same remedy
against the defendant, for the amount so paid by him, as is now
provided by law for bail against their principal, where a judgment is paid or. satisfied by them. 
SEC. 11. If the sheriff shall fail to return a bond, taken by
virtue of the provisions of this chapter, or shall have neglected
to take one when he ought to have done so, in any attachment
issued under any provisions of this chapter, the plaintifff in the
attachment may cause a rule to be entered, at any time during
the first two days of the term to which the writ is returnable,
requiring the said sheriff to return the said bond; or in case no
bond has been taken, to show cause why such bond was not
taken. If the said sheriff shall not return the said bond within
one day thereafter, or show kgal and sufficient cause why the
said bond had not been taken, ju.dgment shall be entered up
against him for the amount of the plaintifff's demand, with costs
of suit : execution may thereupon issue for the same, whenever 
judgment shall have been entered against the defendant in the
attachment. 
SEC. 12. When the sheriff shall be unable to find property 
of any defendant, sufficient to satisfy any attachment issued un­
der the provisious of this chapter, he is hereby required to
summon all person~ within his county, who may be named in
the writ, or whom the creditor shall designate as having any prop­
erty, effects or choses in action, in their possession or power.
belonging to the defendant; or who are in anywise indebted to
such defendant, to appear before the court to whieh the writ is
returnable, on the return day of the attachment, then and there
to answer, upon oath, what amount they are indebted to the de­
fendant in the attachment, or what property, effects or choses in
action ho or she had in his or her possession or power, at the 
.time of serving the attachment; the person or persons so sum­
moned shall be considered as garnishees, and the sheriff shall
state in his return the names of all persons so summoned, and
the date of service on each. 
SEC. 13. When any attachment shall be issued out of the
district court, and levied or served on a garnishee, it shall be
the duty of the sheriff to return the same if required by the
plaintifff and· on return thereof, the clerk shall give notice for
four weeks successively in some weekly newspaper published 
in this territory, most convenient to the place where the court
is held,' of such attachment and at whose suit, against whose
estate, for what sum, and before what court the same is pending,
and that unless the defendant shall appear on the return day of
such writ, j u<lgment will be entered, and the estate attached
will be sold: Providol, TLat in case of foreign attachment, if
sixty' <lays shall not intervene between the first insertion of
such notice, and the first term of the court, then the cause shall
be continued until the next term of. the court. Any defendant
in attachment may appear and plead without giving bail or en­
tering into bond. 
SEC. 14. If the defendant appear, put in sufficient bail and
plead as aforesaid, his estate so attached shall he liberated, and
the garnishee or g1rnisbees, if nny, discharged. 
SEC. 15. If any attachment as aforesaid, shall be returned ex­
ecuted, and the estate attached shall not be replevicd, or defense
shall not be made 'as this chapter directs, the plaintifff shall be
entitled to judgment for his whole debt and costs, having estab­
lished the existence of such debt by legal testimony, and may
thereupon take execution for the same, according to law, as pro­
vided in other cases of debt; all the estate attached, and not
replevied, shall be sold for, and towards satisfying the plaintifff's
judgment, in the same manner as such property is required to
be, when taken in execution on a writ of fieri facias ; where an
attachment shall· be returned, served in the bands of any gar­ 
nishee, it shall be lawful, upon his or her appearance and examin­
ation in the manner as is by this chapter directed, to enter up
jml.'..;mcnt,r an.l award execution against every such garnishee,
judgment having been first entered against the original debtor,
for all sum or sums of money due from him or them to the
defendant in the attachment, or in his, her or their custody, or 
po:-:~r·:-:;-:ion, for the use of such original debtor, or RO much
thereof as shall be of value sufficient to satisfy the debt and
costs of the complaint; all goods and effects whatsoever, in the 
hau.ls of any garnishee or garnishees belonging to such defend­
ant, shall also be liable to satisfy such judgtucnt. The court be­ 
fore which an~~ attachment is pending, shall by the verdict of a 
jury, or w itlrout such jury if the parties agree, assess the value
of all good.,, chattels and personal effects, not including money,
found or confessed to be in the possession or custody of any
garnishee, belonging to the defendant, and shall thereupon
direct that such garnishee, within some time to be fixed in the
order of the court, surrender such goods and chattels and per­
sonal effects to the sheriff to be sold upon execution against the
defendant! aud if by the sheriff's return to any such writ of 
execution or otherwise, it sha ll appear to the satisfaction of the
court that such garnishee hath failed to surrender such goods,
chattels and personal eflects, or any thereof, in compliance with
the order of the court, judgment shall thereupon be given
against such garnishee for the value so assessed as aforesaid,
and execution shall be awarded as in other cases. 
SEC. 16. When any garnishee shall be summoned by the
sheriff or other officer, in the manner aforesaid, and shall fail to
appear and discover on oath or affirmation, as by this chapter is
directed, it shall be lawful for the court, after solemnly calling
the garnishee, and such court is hereby authorized to enter a
conditional judgment against such garnishee; and thereupon a
scirc facias shall issue against such garnishee, returnable to the
next term of the court, to show cause, if any he Lave, why final 
judgment should not be entered up against him, upon such
scire facias being duly executed and returned; if such garnishee
shall fail to appear accordingly, and discover on oath or aflirrna­
tion in the manner aforesaid, the court shall confirm such judg­
ment, and award execution for the plaintifff's whole judgment
an<l costs; and if, upon the examination of any garnishee, it 
shall appear to the court that there is any of tho defendant's
estate in the hands of any person or persons who huve not been:
summoned, such court shall, upon motion of the plaintifff grant
a judicial attachment, to be levied upon the property in the·
hands of any such person or persons having any of the estate
of the defendant in his or thci r possession or custody, who shall.
appear and answer and be liable, as other garnishees; where any
garnishee shall deliver te the sheriff all the goolls, chattels and
effects whatsoever, found or confessed to be in his or her pos­
sc- . sion, b1·lo11ging to the defendant, or ~my part thereof, the

aforesaid, it sbali and may be lawful for any such plaintifff at
any time during the return term of the said court, to prepare,

ing the goods, chattels, monies, credits and effects of the said
defendants, and the value thereof, in his, her or their possession,

ality of pleading, a jury to be empaneled immediately (unless
good cause be shown by either party for a continuance) to in­
quire what is the true amount due from such 'garnishee to the
defendant, and what goods and chattels are in his possession, be­
longing to the defcnda nt : npon such examination, witnesses
may be examined by t.h c respective parties, us in ordinary cases;
if the finding of tho jury shall be against such garnishee, the
court shall grant judgment in the same manner as if the facts

S:e:c. 5. The action of ejectment shall hereafter be commenced
by the filing of a declaration in the office of the district court
of the proper county, whereupon a summons shall issue directed
to the sheriff for service as in other cases. And in all cases in
ejectment where the said summons shall be served ten days be­
fore the first day of the term of court to which the said sum- 
mons is returnable, the defendant or defendants shall be required
to plead, and the said cause shall be set for trial a1 is provided
in other cases. The sheriff shall serve the said summons by
reading to the defendant, or, in case they cannot be found in the
county, then by delivering a copy of said summons to some
person of the family of the defendant of the age of ten years
or upwards, who shall be found residing at the dwelling-house
of said defendant. 
SEO. 6. The us~ of fictitious names of plaintifffs or defendants,
and of the names of any other than the real claimants and the
real defendants, and the statement of any lease or demise to
the plaintifff and of an ejectment by an actual or nominal
ejector, are hereby abolished. 
SEC. 7. It shall be sufficient for the plaintifff to aver in his decla­
ration, that on some day therein to be specified, and which shall
be after his title accrued, he was possessed of the premises ia
question, (describing them r.s hereinafter provided) and being 
80 possessed thereof, that the defendant afterwards ( on some
day to be stated) entered into such premises, and that he unlaw­
fully withholds from the plaintifff the possession thereof, to hia
damage-any nominal sum the plaintifff shall think proper to
state ; and the premises so claimed shall be described in such
declaration with convenient certainty, so that from such de­
scription, possession of the premises claimed mar be delivered.
If such plaintifff claims any undivided share or interest in any
premises, he shall state the same particularly, in such declare­
tion. 
SEO. 8. The plaintifff shall in every case state in his declara­
tion whether he claims in fee, or whether he claims for bis own
life or the life of another, or for a term of years, specifying
sueh life or the duration of such term; or if suoh plaintifff
claims the right to occupy and possess the premises, under the
local laws of any mining district or otherwise, the declaration
shall contain a brief statement of such claim, and whether the
same be by pre-emption or purchase.3 
Ssc, 9. In any case the declaration may contain several couats,
and several parties may be named as plaintifffs, jointly in one
count, and separately in others. 
S:sa. 10. A defendant in ejectment may, at any time before
pleading, apply to the court, or to any judge thereof, in vaca- 
. uon, to compel the attorney for the plaintifff to produce to such
court or officer, his authority for commencing the action in the
name of auy plaintifff therein; such application shall be accom­
panied by an affidavit of the defendant, that he has not been
served wita proof, in HY way, of the authority of the attorney
to use the name of the plaintifff, stated in the declaration. 
SEC. 11. Upon such application, the court or officer shall
grant an order, requiring the production of such authority, and 
shall atay all proceedings in the action until the same shall be
produced. Any written request of such plaintifff, or his agent,
to commence such action, or any written recognition of the
authority of the attorney to commence the same, duly proved
by the affidavit of such attorney, or other competent witneu,
shall be sufficient presumptive evidence of such authority. 
S~c. 12. If H shall appear that previous to such application
by any defendant, he was served with a copy of the affidavit of
the plaintifff's attorney, showing his authority to bring such
action, such application shall be dismissed; and such defendant
shall be liable for the costs of such application, the payment of
which may be compelled by attachment, as in other cases,
which may be issued upon proof of disobedience to the order
of the court or officer directing the payment of such costs. 
SEC. 13. The defendant may demur to the declaration, as in
persenal actions, or be shall plead the general issue only,'which
shall be that the defendant is not guilty of unlawfully with·
holding the premises claimed by the plaintifff; as alleged in the
declaration; and the filing of such plea or demurrer shall be
deemed an appearance in the cause; and upon such plea, the
defendant may give the same matter in evidence, and the same
proceedings shall be had as upon the plea of not guilty, in the
present action of ejectment, except as herein otherwise pro­
vided; the defendant may likewise give in evidence any matter
which if pleaded in the present writ of right would bar the
action of the plaintifff. 
SEC. 14. The consent rule heretofore used is hereby abol­
iahed. 
SBC. 15. It shall not be necessary for the plaintifff to pron
an actual entry under title, nor the actual receipt of any of the
profits of the premises demanded, but it shall be sufficient !or
him to show a right to the possession of such premises at the
time of the commencement of the suit, as heir, deviaee, pur­
chaser or otherwise. 
SEO. 16. It shall Mt be necessary oa the trial, for t·he defend·
allt to confess, nor for the plaintifff' to prove lease and ouster, -or 
either of them, except as provided in the next section ; but
this section shall not be construed to impair, nor in any way to 
effect any of the rules of evidence now in force, in regard h
the maintenance and defense of the action. 
S:e:c. 17. If the action be brought by one or more tenants in
oommon, or joint tenants, against their co-tenants, the plaintifff;
in additioa to all other evidence which he may be bound to give,
shall be required to prove on the trial of the cause, that the
defendant actually ousted such plaintifff, or did some other aot
amounting to a total denial of his right as such co-tenant. 
S:e:o. 18. If the aetion be brought agains; several defendants,
and a joint possession of all be proved, the plaintifff shall l,e 
entitled to a verdict against all, whether they shall haTe plead·
ed separately or jointly. 
S:e:o. 19. When the action is against several defendants, if it 
appear on the trial that any of them occupy distinct parcels in
severalty or jointly, the plaintifff shall elect at the trial against
which he will proceed, which electionshall be made before the tes­
timony in the cause shall be closed, and a verdict shall thereupon
be readered for the defendants not so proceeded against .. 
SEC. 20. In the following cases, the verdict shall be rendered
as follows: 
First, If it be shown on the trial that all the plaintifffs have a
right tr> recover the possession of the premises, the verdict in
that respect shall be for the plaintifffs generally. 
Second, If it appear that one or more of the plaintifffs have a
right to the possession of the premises, and that one or more 
have not such right, the verdict shall specify for which plaintifff 
the jury find, and as to which plaintifff they :find for the de­
fendant. 
Third, If the verdict be for any plaintifff, and there be several
defendants, the verdict shall be rendered against such of them
as were in possession of the premises, or as claimed title there·
to at the commencement of the action. 
Fourth, If the verdict be for all the premises claimed as spec·
Hied in the declaration, it shall in that respect be for such prem·
ises generally. 
Fifth, If the verdict be {or a part of the premises described
in such declaration, the verdict shall particularly specify such
part, as the same shall have been proved, with the same certain· 
ty hereinbefore required in the description of the premises

the premises claimed, it shall specify such share or interest, and 
if for an undivided share in a part of the premises claimed, ii

premises as hereinbefore required. 
Seventh, The verdict shall also specify the estate which shall
l'lave been established on the trial by the plaintifff in whose
faTor it shall be rendered," whether such estate be in fee for his
own life, or for the life of another, stating such lives, or whether 
it be for a term of years, specifying the duration of such term,
or whether the plaintifff hath established only his right to the
possession and occupancy of the premises in controversy. 
SEC. 21. If the right or title of a plaintifff in cjcctment ex· 
pire, after the commencement of the suit, but before trial, the 
verdict shall be returned according to the fact, and judgment
shall be entered, that he recover his damages by reason of the
withholding of the premises by the defendant, to be assessed,
and that as to the premises claimed, the defendant go thereof
whhout day. 
SEC. 22. 'I'he action of ejectment shall not be abated by the
death of any plaintifff; or of one of several defendants, after
issue and before verdict and judgment, but the same proceed­
ings may be had. as in other actions, to substitute the names of
those who may succeed to the title of the plaintifff so dying, in
which case, the issue shall be tried as between the original par­
ties; and in case of the death of a defendant, the cause shall
proceed against the other defendants," 
SEC. 23. In cases where no other provision jg made, the judg­ 
ment in the action, if the plaintifff prevail, shall be that the
plaintifff' recover the possession of the premises, aceording to
&he verdict of the jury, if there was such verdict ; or if the
judgment be by default, according to the description thereof in 
the declaration, with costs, to be taxed. 
SEC. 24. The plaintifff recovering judgment shall be entitled 
to a writ sf posseasion, which shall be substantially in the fol­
lowing form :7 
THE PEOPLE, &c., to the sheriff &c.: Whereas, A. B. has
l_a~ely, in the district court, held in and for the county of--, 
by the judgment of the said court, recovered aga.inst C. D., one
messuage, &c., ( describing the premises recovered, with the like
certainty as above provided), which said premises have been
and are still unjustly withheld from the said A. B._ by the said
C. D., whereof he is convicted as appears to us of record, and
his said judgment against the said C. D., according to the force,
form and effect of his said recovery. Wherefore, we command
you, that without delay, you deliver to the said A. B. possession
of the premises so recovered, with the appurtenances, and that
you certify t0 &c., at &c., on &c., in what manner you shall have
executed this writ; (if there be costs to be collected, the proper
clause may be here inserted, or a separate execution may be is1Ued therefore.) Witness, &c. 
S:e:c. 25. Every judgment in the action of ejectment, rendered
upon a verdict, shall be conclusive, as to the title established in
such action, upon the party against whom the same is rendered,
and against all persons claiming from, through or under such
party, by title accruing after the commencement of such action,
subject to the exceptions hereinafter named.8 
SEC. 26. The court in which such judgmentshall be rendered,
at any time within one year thereafter, upon the application of 
the party against w horn the same was rendered, his heirs or as­ 
signs, and upon the payment of all costs and damages recovered
thereby, shall vacate such judgment, and grant a new trial in 
such cause ; and the court upon subsequent applicatien, made
withiR one year after the rendering of the second judgment in 
said cause, if satisfied that justice will thereby be promoted,
and the rights of the parties more satisfactorily ascertained and 
established, may vacate the judgment and grant another new
trial; but no more than two new trials shall be granted under
this section," 
SEc. 27. Every judgment in ejectment rendered by default,
shall from and after two years from the time of entering the
saine, be conclusive upon the defendant, and upon all persou
claiming from or through him by title accruing after the com- 
mencement of the action ; but within two years after the enter­
Ing of such judgment, on the application of the defendant, his
heirs or assigns, and upon the payment of all costs and dam­
ages recovered thereby, the court may vacate such judgment,
and grant a new trial, if such court shall be satisfied that jus­
tice will be promoted, and the rights of the parties more satis­ 
factorily ascertained and established. 
SEC. 28. But if the defendant, at the time of the entering of
the judgment by default, be either, first, within the age of
twenty-one years; or second, insane; or thi'rd, imprisoned
on any criminal charge, or in execution upon some conviction
of a criminal offense, for any term less than for life; or fourth,
a married woman ; the time d u ring which the disability shall eon­
tinue, shall not be deemed any portion of the said two years, but
any such person may bring an action for the recovery of such
premises after that time, and within two years after Ruch disa­
bility shall be removed, but not after that period. 
SEC. 29. If the person entitled to commence such action shall
die during the continuance of any disability specified in the
preceding section, and no determination or judgment be had of
or upou the title, right or action so to him accrued, his heirs
may commence such action after the time above limited for that
purpose, and within two years after his death. 
Ssc. 80. If the plaintifff shall have taken possession of the
premises by virtue of any recovery in ejeetment, such posses­
sion shall not in any way be affected by the vacating of any
judgment as herein provided ; and if the defendant recover in
any new trial hereby authorized, he shall be entitled to a writ
of possession, in the same manner as if he were plaintifff. 
SEC. 81. Upon any new trial granted as herein provided, the
defendant may show any matters in bar of a recovery, w hich he
might show to entitle him to the possession of the premises, if
he were plaintifff in the action. 
SEC. 82. The plaintifff recovering judgment in ejectment in
any of the cases in which such action may be maintained, shall
also be entitled to recover damages against the defendant for the
rents and profits of the premises recovered. 
SEC. 83. Instead of the action of trespass for mesne profits
heretofore used, the plaintifff seeking to recover such damages
shall within one year after the entering of the judgment make
and file a suggestion of such claim, which shall be entered with
tlrn proceedings thereon upon the record of such judgment, or
be attached thereto as a. continuation of the same. 
S1w. 34. Such suggestions shall be substanrially in the same
form as is now in use for a declaration in an action of a3sump- 
1it, for use and occupation as near as may be; and it shall be 
served on the defendant in the same manner hereinbefore pre­
scribed, respecting the service of a summons in ejectment; and
the same rules of pleading thereto, shall be observed as upon
declaration in personal actions. 
Sim. 35. The defendant ma.y plead the general issue of non
assumpsit, and under such plea may give notice of, or may
plead specially any matter in bar of such claim, except such as 
were or might have been controverted in such action of eject­
ment, but he may plead or give notice of a recovery by such
defendant or any other person of the same premises, or of part
thereof, subsequent to the verdict in such action of ejectment, in
bar or in mitigation of the damages claimed .by the plaintifff. 
SEc. 36. Ir any issue of fact be joined on such suggestion, it
shall be tried as in other cases; and if sueh issue be fsund for
the plaintifff, the same jury shall assess his damages to the
amount of the mcsne profits received by the defendant since he
entered into possession of the premises, subject to the restric­
tions hereinafter contained. 
SEC. 37. On the trial of such issue, the plaintifff shall be re­
quired to establish, and the defendant may controvert, the time
when such defendant entered into the possession of the premi­
ses. The time during which he enjoyed the mesne profits of
the premises shall not be evidence of such time. On such
trial, the defendant shall have the same right to 'sei-off any im­
provements made on the premises to the amount of the plaint­
iff's claim, as is now, or shall hereafter be allowed by law, and
in estimating the plaintifff's damages, the value of the use by
the defendant of any improvements made by him, shall not be
allowed to the plaintifff. 
SEC. 38. If no issue of fact be joined on such suggestion, or
if judgment thereon be rendered against the defendant by de­
fault, on demurrer, or otherwise, a writ of inquiry to assess the
value of such mesne profits shall bo issued, of the execution ot 
which the same notice shall be given to the defendant or his at­
torney, as in other cases. 
SEC. 39. Upon the execution of such writ, the plaintifff shall
be required to establish the same matters herein before required
in the case of an issue being joined; and the defendant may in
like manner controvert the same, and make any set-off to w hich
he shall be entitled, and the jury shall assess the damages in the
same manner; the same proceedings shall be had on such writ,
and it shall be returned as in other eases, with the inquisition
taken thereon; upon such inquisition, or upon the verdict of
the jury, in the case of the issue being joined, the court shall
render judgment as in actions of asaumpsit for use and occupa­
tion, which shall have the like effect in all resrecta. 
SEC. 40. If the plaintifff in ejectment shal have died after 
issue joined on the judgment therein, his personal representa­
tives may enter a suggestion of such death, of the granting let­
ters, testamentary or of administration, to them, and may sug­
gest their claim to the mesne profits of the premises recovered,
in the same manner and with the like effect as the deceased ;
and the same proceedings in all respects shall be had thereon. 
SEC. 41. In all cases in which any persen has heretofore en­
tered upon and occupied, or shall hereafter enter upon and oc­
cupy any lands, tenements or hereditaments within this terri­
tory, by virtue of any lease or permit from the United States, or
this territory, such person, his, her or their heirs or assigns, may
have and maintain an action of ejectment against any person
who has or may enter upon such lands, tenements or heredita­
ments without the consent of such lessee, his, her or their heirs
or assigns, and proof of the right of possession shall be suffi­
cient to authorize a recovery. 
SEC. 42. It shall not be necessary in trials of ejectment,
when it shall appear by the return that the defendant or defend­
ants were in possession of the premises at the time when the
suit was brought, for the plaintifff to prove that said defendant
or defendants were in possession at the time of bringing such
suit, unless the defendant or defendants shall by special plea
deny that he, she or they were in possession; and the plea of
not guilty shall not put in issue the possession of the said premises, anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding. 
SEc. 43. Every person who may hereafter be evicted from any
land for which he can show a plain, clear and connected title in
law or equity, deduced from the record of some public office,10 
without actual notice of an adverse title, in like manner derived
from record, shall be exempt and free from all and every species
of action, writ or prosecution for or on account of any rents or
profits, or damages which shall have been done, accrued or in­
curred at any time prior to receipt of actual notice of the ad­
Terse claim by which the eviction may be effected': Provided,

trict, shall be deemed and taken to be evidence of title in the
party who made such entry or purchase, or his heirs and as­
signs; but a patent for land shall be deemed and considered a

assigns, than such register's certificate of entry and purchase of
