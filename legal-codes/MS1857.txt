have been so taken advantage of; or for any informality in entering 
up the judgment by the clerk; neither shall any judgment entered by

stayed or reversed, for any omission· or fault, which would not have
been good cause to stay or reverse the judgment, if there had been a

proceedings in the suit, in which such judgment or decree shall be
rendered, any verdict, bond, bill, note, or other writing of the like
nature or kind, whereby such judgment or deoree may · be safely
amended, it shall be the duty of the court in which such judgment
shall be rendered, and of the judge thereof, in vacation, to amend

shall be rendered accordingly, it shall be lawful for the plaintifff at
the same or any future term of the court, to release in open court any
such excess ; or he may in vacation release the same, in writing under

judgment, shall proceed to give such judgment as the court below 
ought to have given, if the release had been filed therein; but in such 
cases, the appellee, or defendant in error, shall par the costs, and the
judgment.shall not be entered against the sureties in the appeal or 
writ of error bond.
