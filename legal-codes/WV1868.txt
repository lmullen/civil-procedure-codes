recover against a vendee, or those claiming under him, lands sold by
such vendor to such vendee, when there is a writing stating the pur­
chase, and the terms thereof, signed by the vendor or his agent. 
21. The payment of the whole sum, or the performance of the
whole duty, or the accomplishment of the whole purpose, which any
mortgage or deed of trust may have been made to secure or effect,
shall prevent the grantee or his heirs from recovering at law, by
virtue of such mortgage or deed of trust, property thereby conveyed,
whenever the defendant would in equity be entitled to a decree re­
vesting the legal title in him without condition. 
22. A defendant shall not be allowed to avail himself of either
of the two preceding sections, unless notice in writing of such 
defense shall be filed with his plea. Whether he shall or shall not
make or attempt such defense, he shall not be precluded from resort­
ing to equity for any relief to which he would have been entitled, if
the said sections had not been enacted.

10. When the defendant shall claim allowance for improvements, 
as before provided, the plaintifff may, by an entry on the record,
require that the value of his estate in the premises, without the 
improvements, shall also be ascertained.
11. The value of the premises, in such case, shall be estimated as 
it would have been at the time of the inquiry, if no such improve­
ments had been made on the premises by the tenant or any person
under whom he claims, and shall be ascertained in the manner here­
in before provided for estimating the value of improvements. 
12. The plaintifff in such case, if judgment is rendered for him,
may, at any time during the same term, or before judgment or decree
is rendered on the assessment of the value of the improvements, in
person or by his attorney in the cause, enter on the record his elec­ 
tion to relinquish his estate in the premises to the defendant at the
value so ascertained, and the defendant shall thenceforth hold all the
estate that the plaintifff had therein at the commencement of the
suit, provided he pay therefore the said value, with interest, in the
manner in which the court may order it to be paid. 
13. The payments shall be made to the plaintifff', or into court for 
his use, and the land shall be bound therefore, and if the defendant
fail to make the said payments within or at the times limited there­
for, respectively, the court may order the land to be sold, and the
proceeds applied to the payment of said value and interest, and the
surplus, if any, to be paid to the defendant; but if the said net pro­

dant shall not be bound for the deficiency.

be a minor or insane, or if such party be a married woman and the
land be not her separate property, such value shall be deemed to be 
real estate, and be disposed of as the court may consider proper, for
the benefit of the persons interested therein. 
15. If the defendant, or his heirs or assigns, shall after the prem­
ises are so relinquished to him, be evicted thereof by force of 
any better title than that of the original plaintifff, the person so
evicted may recover from such plaintifff, or his representatives, the

1. If a person accept a bill of· exchange, payable at the house of 
a banker or other place, without further expression in his acceptancc, such acceptance shall be deemed a general acceptance, and 
the presentment of the bill for payment may be either at such place,
or as it might have been if no such place had been specified in the
acceptance. If an acceptor shall, in his acceptance, express that he
accepts the bill, payable at a banker's house or other place only, and
not otherwise or elsewhere, such acceptance shall be deemed a quali­ 
fied acceptance, and in such case the presentment of the bill for pay­
ment shall be at the place specified in such qualified acceptance. But
as against the maker of a note or the acceptor of a bill, whether the
acceptance be general or qualified, it shall not be necessary to aver
or prove presentment for payment at the time or place specified in
the note, bill, or acceptance. Such maker or acceptor may, however,
set up, as a matter of defense, any loss sustained by him, by reason
of the failure to make such presentment. 
2. If a bill of exchange, wherein the drawer shall have expressed
that it is to be payable in any place other than that by him men­ 
tioned therein to be the residence of the drawee, shall not, on the
presentment thereof for acceptance, be accepted, such bill may, with­
out further presentment to the drawee, be protested for non-payment
in the place in which it shall have been, by the drawer, expressed to
be payable, unless the amount thereof be paid to the holder on the
day on which the bill would have become payable, had it been duly 
accepted.
8. A bill or note which becomes due on a Sunday shall be pay- 
able, and may be protested, on the preceding day; and a bill or note
which becomes due on a Christmas day, or the first day of January, or
the fourth dar. of July, shall be payable and may be protested on the
preceding day, or if that be Sunday, then on the preceding Saturday. 
4: When a bill or note is protested, either under the preceding
section or otherwise, on the day preceding any Sunday, Christmas 
day, first day of January, or fourth day of July, notice of the dIS- 
honor thereof need not be given until the first day afterwards which
is not Sunday, Christmas day, or the first day of January, or the

attachment, where the plaintifff has given bond, may be retained by,
or returned to, the person in whose posse.ssi,n it was, on his giving 
bond, with condition to have the same forthcoming at such time and
place as the court may require; or the defendant against whom the
claim is may release from any attachment the whole of the estate
attached, by giving bond, with condition to perform the judgment or
decree of the court. The bond, in either case, shall be taken by the
officer serving the attachment, with security, payable to the plain- 
tiff, and in a penalty, in the latter case, at least double the amount
or value for which the attachment issued, and in the former, either 
double the same or double the value of the property retained or
returned, at the option of the person giving it. 
11. Every such bond shall be returned by the officer to, and filed
by, the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending, or to which
the attachment is returnable; and the plaintifff may, within thirty
days after the return thereof, file exceptions to the same, or to the
sufficiency of the security therein. If such exceptions be sustained, 
the court shall rule the said officer to file a good bond, with sufficient
security, to be approved by it, on or before a certain day to be fixed
by the court. If he fail to do so, he and his sureties in his official
bond shall be liable to the plaintifff as for a breach of such bond.
But the officer shall have the same rights and remedies against the
parties to any bond so adjudged bad, as if he were a surety for 
them.

( except against non-residents), on such affidavit as is mentioned in
the first section of this chapter, although the property or estate
attached be not replevied as aforesaid, the interest and profits there·
of, pending the suit and before judgment or decree, may be paid to
the defendant, if the court deem it proper; and at any time during 
such period, the court, or in vacation, the judge thereof, may dis­
charge the attachment, as to the whole of the estate of the defendant
against whom the claim is, on his giving bond, with security, payable
to the plaintifff, in a penalty double the value of such estate, with
condition, if judgment or decree be rendered for the plaintifff in said
suit, to pay the said value, or so much thereof as may be necessary

the instance of any claimant thereof who shall deliver to the officer

thereof, payable to said officer, conditioned to pay to all persons who
may be injured by suspending the sale thereof until the claim there­

ately before the levy, and if the case be one in which an undertaking
for the forthcoming of the property is not prohibited from being
taken from the debtor by the seventh section of chapter one hun­
dred and forty-two, take from the claimant an undertaking, with
sufficient surety, payable to the creditor, with such recital as is
required in an undertaking taken from the debtor, and with condi­
tion that the property shall be forthcoming at such day and place
of sale as may be thereafter lawfully appointed; whereupon, such
property may be permitted to remain at the risk of such claimant
in such possession as it was immediately before the levy; and the
provisions of the said chapter shall apply to such undertaking in
like manner as to an undertaking taken from the debtor. 
8. When property, the sale of which is indemnified, sells for more

6. Whenever any judge of a circuit· court shall have appointed a 
special term of any circuit court in the manner directed by the pre­
ceding section, and shall have afterwards ascertained that lie cannot
hold the said special term on the day appointed for it, he mny, by
warrant under his hand, directed to the clerk of the court, adjourn 
it to such other day as he may deem proper. Such warrant shall be

same manner as if the same had stood for trial at the next preceding
term, and the court had adjourned without disposing thereof. 
8. ~\.t any such special term any civil cause may be tried which

tinued; and any cause or matter of controversy in chancery, then
ready for hearing, may be heard and determined, although it could
not lawfully have been heard at the next preceding term that was 
or should have been held. Every such special term may be held by
the judge of the circuit, or, if he be dead or absent, by any other
circuit judge who may be present; and it may be held, part of' its 
session by one judge and part by another; and such special terms
may be adjourned from time to time during the intervals between

any time before the appearance of the defendant, or after such ap- 
pearnnce if substantial justice will be promoted thereby. But if
such amendment be made after the appearance of the defendant, the
court may impose such terms upon the plaintifff as to a continuance
of the cause, and the payment of the costs of such continuance, as
it may deem just. The plaintifff may also, at any time after the
appearance of the defendant, in the vacation of the court wherein
the suit is pending, file in the clerk's office, with the other papers
in the cause, an amended declaration or bill, supplemental bill, or
bill of revivor; whereupon the clerk shall issue a summons against
the defendant, requiring him to plead to, or answer, such amended
declaration or bill. But if the court shall be of opinion that the
same was improperly filed, it shall dismiss such declaration or bill
at the costs of the plaintifff.

18. If a defendant plead in abatement that any other persons

plea, it appear that the action could not, by reason of chapter
ninety-eight, or chapter one hundred and four, be maintained against
such other persons, or any of them, such issue shall be found against
the defendant so pleading. 
19. After such plea in abatement, the plaintifff, without proceeding
to trial upon an issue thereon, may amend his declaration, and make
the persons named in such plea as joint contractors, defendants in

upon the new defendants; and, if it appear by the subsequent plead­
ings in the action, or at the trial thereof, that all the original defen­
dants are liable, but that one or more of the other persons named in
such plea are not liable, the plaintifff shall be entitled to judgment,
or to verdict and judgment, as the case may be, against the defend­
ants who appear liable; and such as are not liable shall have judg­
ment, and recover costs as against the plaintifff, who shall be allowed 
the same as costs against the defendants who so pleaded.

eral matters, whether of law or fact, as he shall think necessary,
except that if he plead the plea. of non est factum he shall not,
without leave of the court, be permitted to plead any other plea
inconsistent therewith. To any special plea, pleaded by a defend- 
ant, the plaintifff may plead as many replications as he may deem
necessary. 
21. The defendant may plead in abatement and in bar at the
same time, but the issue on the plea in abatement shall be first tried.
And if such issue be found against the defendant, he may, never­ 
theless, make any other defense he may have to the action.
22. In a plea, replication, or subsequent pleading, intended to be 
pleaded in bar, or in maintenance of the action, it shall not be
necessary to use any allegation of "actionem non," or "precludi
non," or to the like effect, or any prayer of judgment. 
23. No party shall be prejudiced by omitting a protestation in
any pleading.

45. There need be no such inquiry in an action of debt upon any

adjournment, by the clerk, and in either case shall have the same
effect, by way of lien or otherwise, as other judgments entered in the
court during such term. But no such judgment shall be so entered
up (except non-suits and dismissions) until the plaintifff, his agent or
attorney, shall file in the cause his affidavit, stating that he verily
believes there is due from the defendant to the plaintifff, upon the
demand in controversy in the suit, including principal and interest,
a sum certain, to be stated in the affidavit, after deducting all just
credits, payments, and sets-off to which the defendant is entitled.
Such judgment shall be for the plaintifff for the amount so stated,
with interest from the date of the judgment, and such other judg­
ment or order may be rendered and made therein as may be proper.
If such affidavit be not made, or the action be one in which an
order for an inquiry of damages has been entered, the plaintifff' can
only recover judgment upon proving his case. If the defendant
has not appeared, and a jury be empaneled in any such action, their
oath shall be that they will well and truly find the amount, if any,
which the plaintifff is entitled to recover in the action, and a true
verdict render according to the evidence.

4. In a suit for any debt, the defendant may at the trial prove,
and have allowed against such debt, any payment or set-off which is
~ described in his plea, or in an account filed therewith, as to give 
the plaintifff notice of its nature, but not otherwise. Although the
claim of the plaintifff be jointly against several persons, and the setoff is of a debt, not to all, but only to a part of them, this section 
shall extend to such set-off, if it appear that the persons against
whom such claim is stand in the relation of principal and surety and

the person entitled to the set-off is the principal. And when the

might have made had an original action been brought upon such setoff, and in the issue, the jury, judge, or justice shall ascertain the 
true state of indebtedness between the parties, and judgment be
rendered accordingly.

alleging any such failure in the consideration of the contract, or

him of the title to real property or of the title or the soundness of
personal property, for the price or value whereof he entered into the
contract, as would entitle him, either to recover damages at law 
from the plaintifff, or the person under whom the plaintifff claims, or
to relief in equity, in whole or in part, against the obligation of the 
contract; or if the contract be by deed, alleging any such matter
existing before its execution, or any such mistake therein, or in the
execution thereof, as would entitle him to such relief in equity; and
in either case alleging the amount to which he is entitled by reason
of the matters contained in the plea. Every such plea shall be verified by affidavit. 
G. If a defendant entitled to such plea. as is mentioned in the preceding section shall not tender it, or though he tender it, if it be 
rejected for not being offered in due time, he shall not be precluded
from such relief in equity as he would have been entitled to if the preceding section had not been enacted. If an issue in fact is joined on
such plea and the same be found against the defendant, he shall be
barred of relief in equity upon the matters alleged in the plea, unless
upon such ground as would entitle a party to relief against a judgment in other cases. Evcrv such issue in fact shall be upon a general replication that the plea is not true; and the plaintifff may give
in evidence, on such issue, any matter which could be given in evidence under a special replication, if such replication were allowed.

or applies to part of the plaintifff's demand, judgment may be forth­ 
with rendered for the part not controverted and the costs accrued
until the filing of the plea or account, and the case shall be pro­
ceeded with for the residue as if the part for which judgment W8:9

such plea or account, the defendant plead some other plea, going
to the whole or residue. of the demand, the case shall not be con­
tinued as to the part not controverted by plea. or account of set­

cause be shown for such continuance. 
9. A defendant who files a plea or account under this chapter
shall be deemed to have brought an action against the plaintifff (at 
the time ·of filing the same), for the matters mentioned in such plea
or account, and the plaintifff shall not, after the plea or account is . 
filed, dismiss his case without the defendant's consent, but shall be
entitled to every ground of defense against the defendant's demand, of
which he might have availed himself by special plea or otherwise in
any action brought against him upon the same demand. On the
trial of the issue in such case, the jury shall ascertain the amount to 
which the defendant is entitled, and apply it as a set-off against the
plaintifff's demand, and if the said amount be more than the plaintifff
is entitled to, shall ascertain the amount of the excess, including 
principal and interest. Judgment in such case shall be for the
defendant against the plaintifff for said excess, with interest from the 
date of the judgment till payment.

he shall not, at law, proceed in the same action against such defendant and his successor, nor shall he, in equity, proceed against both
upon his previous bill, unless an order, that the suit proceed against
the former party, be entered at the first term after service of a scire 
facias for or against such successor.

unless such court direct otherwise, be sold after such notice as is pre- 
scribed in the case of horses by the twentieth section of chapter
forty-one, and be conveyed to the purchaser by the officer or his 
deputy. An officer to whom there is delivery under this chapter,
when the delivery is of money, bank notes, or any goods or chattels, 
shall dispose of tho same as if levied on by him under a writ of fieri
facias ; and when the delivery is of evidences of debts, (other than
such bank notes), may receive payment of such debts within sixty
days after such delivery. Any evidence of debt or other security
remaining in his hands at the end of said sixty days shall be returned by him to the clerk's office of such court. For a failure to make
such return, he may be proceeded against as if an express order of
said court for such return had been disobeyed. 
10. On a suggestion by the judgment creditor that, by reason of the

delivered, or in the name of any other officer who may be designa­
ted for the purpose by an order of the court in which the judgment
is, or, if the judgment be of a justice, by an order of the circuit
court of the county. No officer shall be bound to bring such suit,

against all expenses and costs which he may incur or become liable
for by reason thereof. But any person interested may bring such
suit at his own costs in the officer's name. 
16. An officer receiving money under this chapter shall, within
thirty days after receiving it, make return thereof to the court, or to
the clerk's office of the court, in which the judgment is, or, if' it was
rendered by a justice, to the circuit court of the county, and for fail­
