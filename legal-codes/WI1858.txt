proceed against the defendant or defendants served, in the same.
manner as if such defendant or defendants were the only parties

of the agent or-attorney ; or if all the material allegations of tho
pleadings be within the personal knowledge of the agent or
attorney. When the pleading is verified by any other person
than the party, he shall set forth in the affidavit his knowledge, or
the grounds of his belief on the subject, and the reasons why it
is not made by the party. When a corporation is a party, the
verification may be made by any officer thereof. And when the
state or any officer thereof in its behalf is a party, tho verification may be made by any person acquainted with the facts, The
verification may be omitted when an admission of tho truth of
the allegations might subject the parties to prosecution for felony.
And no pleading can be used in a criminal prosecution against
the party as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleadings. 
SECTION 20. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth
in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, but he 
shall deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand
thereof in writing, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading
is verified, must be verified by his own oath, or that of his agent
or attorney, if within the personal knowledge of such agent or
attorney, to the effect that ho believes it to be true, or be pre- 
eluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge
thereof, or a county judge, may order a further account when
the one delivered is defective ; and the court may in all cases
order a bill of particulars of the claim of either party to Le 
furnished, 
SECTION 2.1. In the construction of a pleading for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations shall be liberally con- 
strued with a view to substantial justice between the parties. 
SECTION 22. If irrelevant and redundant matter be inserted
in a pleading, it may be stricken out on motion of any perrnn 
aggrieved thereby; and when the allegations of a pleading are
so indefinite or uncertain, that tlte precise nature of' the charge
or defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading
to be made definite and certain by amendment. 
SECTIOX 23. In pleading a judgment or other determination 
or o. court or officer of special jurisdiction, it shall not be neces­
sary to state the facts conferriug jurisdiction, but such judgment
or determination may be stated to ham been duly given or made. 
If such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establish on the trial the facts conferring jurisdiction. 
BECTIOS 24. In pleading the performance of conditions pre­
cedcnt in a contract, it shall uot be necessary to state the facts 
showing such performance, but it may be stated generally that
the party duly performed all the conditions on his part, and if 
such allegation be controverted, the party pleading shall be
bound to establish 011 the trial the facts showing such perform­
ance. In an action or defense founded upon an instrument for 
the payment of money only, it shall be sufficient for the party
to give a copy of the instrument, and to state that there is due
to him thereon, from the adverse party, a specified mm which
he claims. 
SECTION 25. In pleading a private statute, or a right derived
therefrom, it shall be sufficient to refer to such statute by its
title and the day of its passage, and the court shall thereupon
take judicial notice thereof. 
SEcTIO:S 26. In an action for libel or slander, it shall not be
necessary to state in the complaint any extrinsic facts for the 
purpose of showing the application to the plaintifff of the defamatory matters out of which the came of action arose ; but it
shall be sufficient to state generally that the same was published
or spoken concerning the plaintifff, and if such allegation lie
controverted, the plaintifff shall be bound to establish on trial
that it was so published or spoken. 
SECTION 27. In the actions mentioned in the last section, the
defendant may in his answer allege both the truth of the matter 
charged as defamatory, and any mitigating circumstances, to
reduce the amount of damages ; and whether he prove the
justification or not, he may give in evidence the mitigating
circumstances. ' 
SECTION 28. In an action to recover the possession of property 
distrnincd, doing damage, an answer that the defendant or
person by whose command he acted was lawfully possessed of 
the real property upon which the distress was made, and that
the pl'opcrty distraiued was at the time doing damage thereon, 
shall be good without setting forth the title to such real
property. 
SECTION 29. The plaintifff may unite in the same complaint
several ca.uses of action, whether they be such as have been 
" d · d gal · 
heretofore enominate le or equitable, or both, where they
arise out of- 
t. The same transaction or transactions connected with the
same subject. or action. 
2. Contract, express or implied. 
3. Injuries, with or without evidence, to person or property,
or either ; or- 
4. Injuries to character ; or- 
5. Claims to recover real property, with or without damages,
for the withholding thereof, and the rents and profits of the
same; or- 
6. Claims to recover personal property, with or without damages, for tho withholding thereof; or- . 
7. Claims against a trustee by virtue of a. contract, or by
operation oflaw. 
SECTION 30. But the causes of action so united must all
belong to one of theso classes, and must affect all the parties to
the action, and not require different places of trial, and must be 
stated respectively. 
SECTION 31. Every material allegation of the complaint, not
controverted by the answer, as prescribed in section ten of this
chapter, and every material allegation of new matter in the 
answer constituting a counterclaim, not controverted by the
reply, as prescribed in section fifteen of this chapter, shall, for
the purpose~ of the action, be taken as true. 
SECTIOY 32. But the allegation of new matter in the answer,
not relating to a counterclaim, or of new matter in a reply, is 
b d
d
. 
to e eeme controverted by the adverse party as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require. 
SECTION 33. No variance between the allegation in a pleading
and the proof shall be deemed material, unless it shall actually 
mislead the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his
action or defense upon its merits. Whenever it shall be alleged
that a party has been so misled, that fact shall be proved to the
satisfaction of the court, and in what respect he has been misled,
and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended
upon such terms as may be just. 
SECTION 3-l. When the variance is not material, as provided
in the last section, the court may direct the fact to be found in 
accordance with the evidence, or may order an immediate amendment without costs. 
SECTIO~ 35. When, however, the allegation of the cause of
action or defense to which tho proof is directed, is improved, 
not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope
and meaning, it shall not be deemed a case of variance within
tho last two sections, but a failure or proof. 
SECTION 36. .Any pleading may be once amended by the
party, of course, without costs and without prejudice to the pro- 
ceeding already had, at any time before the period for answering 
it expires, or it can be so amended at any time within twenty 
days after the service of the answer or demurrer to' such plead­
ings, unless it be made to appear to the court that it was done
for the purpose of delay, and the plaintifff or defendant will
thereby lose the benefit of a term or circuit for which it is or
may be noticed ; and if it appear to the court that such amend­
ment was made for that purpose, the same may be stricken out
and such terms imposed as to the court may seem just. In such
case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the
adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, either at a
general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, 'if i\ 
appear that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the 
party to plead on such . terms as may seem just. If tho
demurrer be allowed for the cause mentioned in the fifth subdi­ 
'Vision of section five of this chapter, the court may, in its dis­
cretion, and upon such terms as may be just, order the action to
be divided into as · many actions as may be necessary to the 
proper determination of the cause of action therein men tioncd. 
SECTION 87.' The court may before or after judgment, in fur­
therance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, 
amend any pleading or proceedings, by adding or striking out
the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake· in the name 
of -a party, or a mistake in- any other respect, or by inserting
other allegations material to the case, or when the amendment
does not change substantially the claim or defense, by conform­
ing the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. 
SECTION 38. The court may likewise in its discretion, and
upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to bo 
made, or .other act to be done, after the time limited by this
chapter, or by an order enlarge such time; and may also in its
discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time
within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judg­
ment, order, or other proceeding against him, through his mis­
take, inadvertence, or surprise, or excusable neglect, and may
supply an omission in any proceedings ; and whenever any pro­
ceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any respect, to the
provisions of law, the court may, in like manner and upon like
terms; permit an amendment of such proceedings so· as to· make 
it conformable thereto. 
SECTION 89. When the plaintifff shall be ignorant of the name
of· a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any plead­ 
ing or proceeding by any name, and when his true name shall
be· discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended
accordingly. 
SECTION 40. The court shall, in every stage of an action, disro­
gard any error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall 
not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party ; and no
judgment shall be reversed or affected by reason of such · error 
or defect. 
SECTION 41. The plaintifff and defendant, respectively, may
be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint, an­ 
swcr, or reply, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after
the former complaint, demurrer, reply, or of which the party
was ignorant when his former pleading was made. 
SECTION 42. When two or more actions are pending in the
same court, which might have been joined, the defendant may
move the court, or the judge thereof in vacation, to consolidate
such actions; and if no sufficient cause be shown against
it, such actions shall be consolidated.

sentative character, and shall be evidence of a debt established

CHAPTER CXXXII. 
OF ISSUES, MODE OF TRIAL, .AND JUDGMENT IN CITIL ACTIONS. 
1. Issues arise upon the pleadings when ~ fact or
conclusion of law is maintained by one party and controverted 
by the other ; they arc of two kinds. 
1. Of law. 
2. Of fact. 
SECTION 2. An issue of law arises upon a demurrer to the 
complaint, answer, or reply, or to some part thereof. 
SECTION' 3. An issue of fact arises :- 
1. Upon a material allegation in the complaint controverted
by the answer ; or- 
2. Upon new mutter in the answer controverted by the reply ;
or- 
3. Upon new matter in the reply, except an issue of law is
joined thereon. 
SECTION 4. Issues both of law and of fact may arise upon
different parts of the pleadings in the same action ; in such
cases the issue of law must be first tried, unless the court otherwise direct. \ 
SECTIO:'i 5. A trial is the judicial examination of tl1e issues
between the parties, whether they be issues of law or qf fact. 
SECTIO~ 6. An issue of law must be tried by t,. e court,
unless it be referred as provided in section twcnty-tw of this 
chapter. An issue of fact in an action for the re overy of
money only, or of specific real or personal property or for a
divorce from the marriage contract on the ground of dultery,
must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be waived], as pro­
vided in section eighteen of this chapter. Every othejr issue is
triable by the court, which, however, may order the wh!Jole issue,
or any specific question of fact involved therein, to bd: tried by
a jury, or may refer it as provided in section twonty-twi o of this
chapter: provided, when in an action for the recovery o~: specific
real property, tho defendant in his answer shall set up aill._ equit­
able defense, and shall also by his answer claim affir~:~
relief against the plaintifff, an issue of fact found upon a denial
of the allegations contained in such answer, shall be triable by '- 
the court, unless otherwise ordered. 
SECTION 7. The clerk shall prepare a calendar of issues for
each term of the circuit court, which shall contain the title of 
eachaction pending, in which an answer or demurrer has been
filed ten days before the term, the names of the attorneys, and 
the time when the last pleading was filed; andall appeals shall
he deemed to be at issue from tho day of the filing of tho returns 
in such appeal. 
RECTIOS 8. The issues on the calendar shall be disposed of
in the following order, unless for the convenience of parties or
the dispatch of business the court shall otherwise direct. 
1. Issues of fact to be tried by a jury.
2. Issues of fact to be tried by the court.
3. Issues of law. 
SECTJOS 9. Either party may bring the issue to trial, and in
the absence of the adverse party, unless the court for good 
cause otherwise direct, may proceed with his case, and take a
dismissal of the complaint, or a verdict, or a judgment, as the 
case m,1y require. A separate trial between the plaintifff and
any of the several defendants may ho allowed by the court,
whenever in its opinion justice will be thereby promoted. 
SECTIO~ 10. A general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues, either in favor
of the plaintifff or defendant. A special verdict is that by 
which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the
court. 
SECTIOS 11. In an action for the recovery of specific personal
property, if the property have not been delivered to the plaintifff, 
or the defendant by his answer claim a return thereof, the jury
shall assess the value of the property, if their verdict be in 
favor of the plaintifff, or if they find in favor of the defendant
that he is entitled to a return thereof, and may at the same
time assess the damages, if they are claimed in the complaint
or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason
of the detention, or taking and withholding such property. In 
every action for the recovery of money only, or specific real
property, the jury in their discretion may render a. general or
special verdict. In all other cases the court may direct the jury
to find a special verdict in writing, upon all or any of the issues,
and in all cases may instruct them, if they render a general
verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in
writing, and may direct a written finding thereon. The special
verdict or finding shall be filed with the clerk and entered upon

need a bill of exceptions be made. If the exceptions be in the
first instance stated in a case, and it be afterward necessary to
separate them, the separation may be made under the direction 
of the court or a judge thereof. The judge who tries the cause
may in his discretion entertain a motion to be made on his 
minutes, to sot aside a verdict, and grant a new trial, upon
exceptions, or for insufficient evidence, or for excessive damages;
but such motions in actions hereafter tried, if heard upon the 
minutes, can only be heard at the same term or circuit at which

court may take the account, or hear the proof, or mo.y in its dis­
cretion order a. reference for that purpose. And when the
action is for the recovery of money only, or of specific real or
personal property, with damages for the withholding thereof, the
court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury, or if the
examination of a long account be involved, by a reference as 
above provided. Iu case the defendant give notice of appear- 
ance in the action before the expiration -of the time for answering, he shall be entitled to eight days' notice of the time and 
place of application to tho court for the relief demanded by the
complaint.

the conrt shall thereupon cause proof to be taken of the demand
mentioned in the complaint, and in case the defendant is a non- 
resident, shall cause the plaintifff or his agent to be examined on
oath, as to any payment that may have been made to such plaintiff, or to any one for his use 011 account of such. demand, and
may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to
recover; and before entering judgment the court may in its discretion require tho plaintifff to cause to be filed satisfactory
security to abide the order of the court touching the restitution
of any estate or effects which may be directed by such judgment 
to be transferred or delivered, or the restitution of any money
that may be collected under or by virtue of such judgment, in
case the defendant or his representatives shall apply and hp 
admitted to defend the action and shall succeed in such defense.
4. In an action arising on a contract for the recovery of 
money only, if the answer of the defendant, either expressly or
by not denying, admits any part of the plaintifff's claim to ho

amount less than the plaintifff's claim, and contains no other 
defense to the action, the clerk, on the application of tho plaintiff, shall enter judgment for the amount so admitted, or for the
amount claimed in the summons, after deducting the amount of 
the defendant's counterclaim or off set: notice of such appliestion shall be given to the defendant.at least five days before the
samo is ma.de. Execution shall be issued upon such judgment
in the manner provided in subdivision one of this section.

court, for judgment thereon, and judgment may be given

answer, cannot exceed tha.t which he shall have demanded in his

rate of damages which he might have heretofore recovered for
the same cause of action.

judgment roll .01· a transcript of a justice's judgment for. ten dol-.
l irs or upward, exclusiveof costs, is filed,~ returaed unis~

otherwise, to the satisfaction of tho court or a judge thereof, a
county judge, or a court commissioner, that any judgment debtor
residing in the county where such judge or officer resides, has
property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfac­
tion of the judgment, such court or judge may by an order
require the judgment debtor to appear, at a specified time and
place, to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may 
thereupon be had for the application of the property of the judg­
ment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as prodded
upon the return of an execution. On an examination under this
section, either party may examine witnesses on his behalf, and the
judgment debtor may he examined in the same manner as a
witness. Instead of the order requiring the attendance of judg­
ment debtor, the judge may, upon proof by affidavit, or other­
wise, to his satisfaction, that there is danger of the judgment
debtor's leaving the state or concealing himself, and that there is
reason to believe he has property which he unjustly refuses to
apply to such judgment, issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of

ordered to enter into an undertaking, with one or more sureties,
that he will from time to time attend before the judge as ho
shall direct, and that he will not, during the pendcncy ef the
proceedings, dispose of any portion of his property not exempt
from execution, In default of entering into such undertaking,
ho may be committed to prison by warrant of the judge, as for a
contempt. Xo person shall, on examination pursuant to this
chapter, be excused from answering any question on the ground
that his examination will tend to convict him of the commission
of a fraud, but his answer shall not be used as evidence against
him in any criminal proceeding or prosecution. 
SECTION 90. After the issuing of execution against property,
any person indebted to the judgment debtor may y,ay to the 
sheriff the amount of his debt, or EO much thereof as shall be
necessary to satisfy the execution, and the sheriff's receipt shall
be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid. 
91. After the issuing or return of an execution
against property of the judgment debtor or any one of several
debtors in the same judgment, and upon an affida,;t that any
person or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or 
is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, the judge 
may by an order require such person or corporation, or any 
officer or member thereof, to appear at a specified timo and
place and answer concerning the same. The judge may also,
his discretion, require notice of such proceeding to bo gi von 
any party to the action, in such manner as may seem to him
proper.

shall be on oath of an officer thereof. 
SECTION 9-1. The judge may order any property of the judgmcnt debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands either 
himself or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor,
be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment, except that 
the earnings of tho debtor for his personal services at any time
within sixty days next preceding the order, cannot be so applied, 
when it is made to appear, by the debtor's affidavit or otherwise,
that such earnings are necessary for the use of a family supported
wholly or in part by his labor. 
SECTION 95. The judge may also by order appoint a receiver
of tho property of the judgment debtor, in the same manner, 
and with like authority as if the appointment was made by the
court according to section thirteen of chapter one hundred and 
thirty [one hundred and twenl!fnine] of the revised statutes; but
before the appointment of such receiver, the judge sho.11 ascertain, if practicable, by the oath of the party or otherwise, whether
any other supplementary proceedings are so pending against the
judgment debtor; the plaintifff therein shall have notice to appear
before him, and shall likewise have notice of all subsequent
proceedings in relation to such receivership; no more than one
receiver of the property of a judgment debtor shall be appointed;
the judge may also by order forbid a transfer or other disposition
of the property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execu- 
tion, and interference therewith.

dissolved by the judge granting the same, at any timo, on such
security as he shall direct.

not, witnesses' fees and disbursements, and a fixed sum in addi­ 
tion, not exceeding fifteen dollars, as costs.
99. If any person, party, or witness disobey an order 
of the judge or referee duly served, such person, party, or wit­
ness may be punished by the judge as for a contempt; and in all 
cases of commitment under this chapter, the person committed
may, in case of inability to perform the act required, or to 
endure the imprisonment, be discharged from imprisonment by
the court or judge committing him, or the court in which the
judgment was rendered, on such terms as may be just.

ages for alleged outrage to. the feelings of the injured party. 
SECTION 4. When there are several plaintifffs or defendants
in any personal action, the cause of which survives, either by the 
common law or by the provisions of this chapter, and any of
them shall die before final judgment, the action shall proceed at 
the suit of the surviving plaintifff, or against the surviving de­
fendant, as the case may be. 
SECTION 5. If, in such case, all the plaintifffs or all the defend­
ants shall die before final judgment, the action may he prose- 
 ·  

of the last surviving plaintifff or defendant, respectively, in the 
same manner as if such survivor had originally been the only
plaintifff or defendant.

motion, to prosecute the action jointly with the survivors, in the
same manner as if he had joined with them in commencing the
action.

tho surviving plaintifffs, or if there be no motion for the admis­
sion of another person as heir, executor, or administrator,

viving plaintifffs may prosecute the action for so much of the
premises in question as may be claimed by them.

surviving defendants, for so much of the premises as they shall
hold or claim.

party shall become insane, the action may be prosecuted or
defended by his guardian, in like manner as if it had been com­
menced after the appointment of the guardian, or the court
may appoint a guardian for the action, as the case may require. 
SECTION 11. When any action is brought by or in the name
of any public officer or by any trustee appointed by virtue of 
, 
any statute, his death or removal shall not abate the writ; but
it may be prosecuted by his successor, provided there be a sue- 
cessor who might have originally commenced and prosecuted
the like action. 
SECTION 12. Whenever the death of a person shall be caused
by a wrongful act, neglect, or default, and the act, neglect, or 
default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover dam- 
age in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person
who or the corporation which would have been liable, if death
had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured : provided, that such
action shall be brought for a death caused in this state, and in
somo court established by the constitution and laws of the same.

her lineal descendants, and to his or her lineal ancestors in
default of such descendants; and in every such action the jury
may give such damages, not exceeding five thousand dollars, as

which·the lands or any portion theteof lie, by complaint, for a divis­
ion and partition thereof' according to the respective rights of the
parties interested therein, and for a sale of such premises, if it
shall appear that the partition thereof cannot be made without
great prejudice to the owners : provided, that when action is
thus instituted, if the plaintifff's complaint does not ask for a
division and partition, or sale, of all the lands so owned by the
parties to the complaint, either of the parties thereto may cause
said complaint to be so amended as to include all the lands thus
owned : provided, also, that when there shall be no appearance
on the part of the defendant or defendants to the action, the
plaintifff shall pay the costs of suit and partition, unless his com­

tioned, or unless the said defendant or defendants shall have 
been served with personal notice.
SECTION 3. Such action may be maintained by any person

defendant if his interest had then existed or been known; but
no person shall be so made a defendant, unless by his consent,
without twenty days' notice of the motion to this effect being

prejudice to the owners. 
8ECTIO!'i 23. If upon the coming in of the report of such persou, the court shall be satisfied that partition of the premises 
between the parties interested therein can be made without
prejudice to the owners, such court shall, by an order to be 
entered in its minutes, appoint three discreet and disinterested
freeholders, commissioners to make tho partition so adjudged
according to the respective rights and interests of the parties, as
the same were ascertained and determined by. such court, and in
such order the court· shall designate the part or shares, if any,
which shall remain undivided for the owners whose interests
shall be unknown or ascertained. '

the court, on or before the coming in of the report of such com­
missioners. 
SECTION 26. In making partition, the commissioners shall
divide the said real estate and allot the several portions and 
shares thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity
relatively considered, according to the respective rights and
interests of the parties so adjudged by the court, designating the

that such partition be firm and effectual forever, and such judg­
ment shall be binding and conclusive-

amend his complaint by making every creditor having o. 'specific 
tien on the undivided interest or estate of any of the parties, by
mortgage or otherwise, a party to the proceedings.

complaint, or by such report, that there are any existing in cum- 
brances upon the estate or interest in the premises of any
party named in the proceedings in the suit, the court shall, in
the order· of sale, direct. the sheriff to bring into court, and pay

court shall proceed to hear the proofs and allegations of the 
parties ; and if any question of fact shall ··arise, which in' the

be paid by the party failing, which payment shall be enforced
by attachment as in other cases.

sl1all have been · ascertained, the court shall · proceed to order a
distribution of the monies so brought into and remaining in

for such sale, and the person entitled to such estate has been
made a party to the proceedings, the court shall first consider
and determine under all the circumstances of the case, whether
such estate ought to be excepted from such sale, or whether the
same should be sold, and in making such determination, regard
shall be had to the interests of all parties. 
SECTION 46. If a sale of the premises including such estate
shall be ordered, the estate and interest of every such tenant or
person shall pass thereby, and the purchaser, his heirs and
assigns, shall hold such premises free and discharged from all

ceedings shall be deducted from the proceeds of such sale.

to discharge the amount due on the mortgage, with costs. 
SECTION 2. The proceeds of every sale made under such
order shall be applied to the discharge of the debt adjudged by 
such court to be due, and of the costs awarded; and if there
shall be any surplus, it shall be brought into court for the use of 
the defendant, or of the person who may be entitled thereto,
subject to the order of the court. 
SECTION 3. If such surplus or part thereof shall remain in
the said court for the term of three months, without being 
applied for, the judge shall direct the same to be put out at
interest, under the direction of the court, for the benefit of the
defendant, his representatives or assigns, to be paid to them by
the order of such court. 
SECTION 4. Whenever an action shall be commenced for the
satisfaction or foreclosure of any mortgage, upon which there 
shall be due any interest, or any portion or installment of the
principal, and there shall be other portions or installments to 
become clue subsequently, the action shall be dismissed upon the
defendant's bringing into court, at any time before the order of
sale, the principal and interest due, with costs. 
5. If after an order for sale entered against a. 
defendant in such case, he shall bring into court the principal
and interest due, with the costs, the proceedings in tho action
shall be stayed ; but the court shall enter a judgment of fore-· 
closure and sale, to be enforced by a further order of the court
upon a subsequent default in the payment of any portion or
installment of the principal, or of any interest, thereafter to
grow due. 
6. If the defendant shall not bring into court the
amount due, with costs, or .if .for any other cause . a judgm?nt 
shall be entered for the plam tiff, the court shall direct a refer­
ence to a proper officer to ascertain and report the situation of 
the mortgaged premises; and if it shall appear that the same can
be sold in parcels without injury to the interests of the parties,
the judgment shall direct so much of the said premises to be
sold as will be sufficient to pay the amount then due on such
mortgage, with costs, and such judgment shall 'remain as
security for any subsequcne default. 
SECTION 7. If in the-tease mentioned in the preceding section
there shall be any default subsequent to such judgment, in the
payment of any portion or installment of the principal, or of any
interest due upon such mortgage, the court may, upon petition
of the complainant, by a further order, founded upon such first
judgment, direct a sale of so much of the mortgaged premises, 
to be made under the said judgment, as will be sufficient to
satisfy the amount so due, with the costs of such petition and 
the subsequent proceedings thereon; and the same proceedings
shall be had as often as a default shall happen. · 
SECTION 8. If, in any of the foregoing cases, it shalf appear to
the court that the mortgaged premises are so situated that the 
sale of the whole will be most beneficial to the parties, the
court shall order and adjudge the sale of the whole accordingly. 
SECTION 9. In such case the proceeds of such sale shall be
applied as well to the interest, portion or installment of the
princi pal due, as toward the whole or residue of the same, 
secured by such mortgage, and not due and payable at the time
of such sale ; and if such residue do not bear interest, then the
court may direct the same to be paid, with a deduction of the
rate of legal interest for the time during which such residue
shall not be due and payable, or may direct the balance of the
proceeds of such sale, after paying the sum due, with costs, to
be put out at interest for the benefit of the plaintifff, to be paid
to him as the installments, or portions of the principal, or the
interest, may become due, and the surplus for the benefit of the
defendant, his representatives or assigns, to be paid to them on
the order of the court.

simple contract or by specialty, to the extent of the estate, 
interest, and right in the real estate which shall have descended
to them from or been devised to them by such person. 
SECTION 35. But such heirs shall not be liable for any such
debt unless it shall appear that the personal assets of the deceased
were not sufficient to pay and discharge the same, or that after
due proceedings before the proper county court, and at law, the
creditor has been unable to collect such debt, or some part
thereof, from the personal representatives of the deceased, or
from his next of kin or legatees. 
SECTION 36. In case the personal assets were sufficient to pay
a part of such debts, or in case a part thereof shall have been 
collected, as in the last section mentioned, the heirs of such
deceased person shall be liable· for the residue unpaid or
unsettled. 
SECTION 37. But the two last sections shall not affect or
impair the liability of heirs for any debt of their ancestor, where
such debt was by his will expressly charged exclusively upon the
real estate descended to such heirs, or where such debt is by such
will expressly directed to be paid out of the real estate descended,
before resorting to the personal estate. 
SECTION 38. It shall be incumbent on the creditors seeking
to charge any heirs, to show the fact and circumstances herein 
required to render them liable.· 
SECTION 39. In cases where the next of kin, heirs, and devisocs are liable for the debts of their ancestors, as herein provided, 
they shall give preference in the payment of the same, and shall

SECTIO:'<i 40. No preference shall be given by any next of kin,
legatee, heir, or devisee, to any debt, over other debts of the same
class, except those specified in. the second class of the last section;
nor shall a debt due and payable, be entitled to a preference over
debts not due ; nor shall the commencement of an action against
any next of kin, legatee, heir, or devisee, for the recovery of any
debt, entitle such debt to any preference over others of the same
class. 
SECTION 41. The next of kin, legatee, heirs, and devisees may
show that there are debts of a prior class unsatisfied, or that there 
are unpaid debts of the same class with that on which the action
is brought, and if it appear that the value of the personal property
delivered to them, or of the real estate descended or devised to
them, does not exceed the debts of a prior class, judgment shall
be rendered in their favor. 
SECTIO~ 42. If the personal property delivered to such next
of kin, or legatee, or if the real estate descended or devised to

entitled to a preference over the debt for which the action is
brought, judgment shall be rendered against them only for such
a sum as shall be a just proportion to the other debts of the same
class with that on which the action is brought. 
SECTION 43. If any debt of a prior class to that on which the
action is brought, or of the same class, shall have been paid by 
any next of kin, legatees, heirs, or dcvisees, they may give evidence
of such payment, and the amount of debts so paid shall be estimated in ascertaining the amount to be recovered, in the same
manner as if such debts were outstanding and unpaid, as prescribed in the two last sections. 
SECTION 44. The heirs of any person who may be liable to 
any creditor of such person,. in consequence of lands having
descended to them, shall be prosecuted jointly, in the circuit court. 
SECTION 45. Actions against heirs or devisees shall not be
delayed, nor shall the remedy of the plaintifffs be suspended, by 
reason of the infancy of any such heir or devisee ; but guardians
to defend their rights in such actions shall be appointed as in 
other cases. 
SECTION 46. In any complaint filed against heirs to charge 
them on account of any lands and tenements, or hereditaments,

of the commencement of the action, or if the heir confess the
action, and show what lands, tenements, or hereditaments have
descended to him, the court shall adjudge that the debt of the
plaintifff, or the proportion thereof which he is entitled to recover,
shall be levied of such real estate so descended, and not otherwise. 
SECTION 50. Every final judgment rendered in such action,
shall have preference as a lien on the real estate descended, to 
 d d b . d . h h . 11
any JU gment or ecree o tame against sue err persona y, 
for any debt or demand in his own right.
51. When it shall appear in any such action that 
before the commencement thereof, any such heir has aliened the
lands, tenements, or hereditaments descended to him, or any 
part thereof, he shall be personally liable for the value of the
estate so aliened; and judgment shall be rendered therefore, and
execution awarded, as in actions for his own debt. 
SECTION 52. In such cases the preference hereinbeforc

shall apply, and such heir may show the same matters hereinbeforc 
allowed, and the same proceedings and judgment shall be had
thereon. 
SECTION 53. But no lands, tenements, or hereditaments
aliened in good faith, by any heir, before any action commenced
against him, shall be liable to execution, or in any manner 
affected by a decree against such heir.

Or several devisees jointly, the amount Which the plaintifff Shall 
be entitled to recover shall be apportioned among the heirs of
the ancestor, or among all the devisees of the testator, in pro­

or devised to such devisees, respectively, as the case may be ; 
and such proportion only shall be recovered of each heir or of
each legatee. 

express the amount recovered against each defendant for debt,
or damages and costs; and the execution issued thereon shall

SECTIO:'.'i 56. When a judgment shall be rendered against
any heirs or dovisees who are infants, no execution issued 
thereon shall be executed against them, until the expiration of 
one year after the rendition of such judgment; but such execu­ 
tion may be executed against any defendants in the same action
who are of full age. 
SECTION 57. The attorney issuing an execution in every such
case shall indorse thereon the names of the defendants who are

infants, an s a irect t 10 s en not to execute t e same 
against such infants until the time specified in the last section. 
SECTION 58. Devisees made liable by the foregoing provisions
to the creditors of their testator, shall not be so liable unless it 
shall appear that his personal assets, o.nd the real estate of the
testator, descended to his heirs, were insufficient to discharge 
such debt ; or unless it shall appear that after due proceedings,
before the proper county judge, and at law, the creditor has been
unable to recover such debt, or some part thereof, from the
personal representatives of the testator, or from hiA next of kin,
or legatees, or from his heirs.

and heirs, may be recovered of the devisees of such testator, to
the extent of the real estate devised to them respectively.

affect the liability of devisees for any debt of their testator,
where such debt was by his will expressly charged exclusively
upon the real estate devised, or made payable exclusively by
such devisee by the terms of the will, or made payable out of
the estate devised, before resorting to the personal estate, or to
any other real estate, descended or devised. 
SECTION 61. It shall be incumbent on the creditor seeking to
charge any devisees, to show on the trial the facts and circum- 
stances herein required to render them liable.
SECTION 62. The provisions herein contained, with regard to 
heirs, and to proceedings by and against them, shall be applicable
to actions and proceedings against devisees, who shall in like
manner be sued jointly. 
SECTION 63. Devisees shall be liable in the same manner,
and to the same extent, as heirs, notwithstanding they may have

would have an interest, had the same not ceased to act as aforesaid, whether held, managed, or controlled by such corporation,
or by a trustee or trustees, assignee or assignees, agent or

part of the defendant, (which shall be such corporation in its
corporate name,) unless such corporation or some one on its
behalf shall make to such plaintifff a bond in the penal sum of
double the amount claimed to be due, executed by two or more
sureties, resident freeholders of this state, who shall swear that
they are each worth, of real estate lying in this state, and liable

under the laws of any other state, government, or country, and 
which have, in whole or in part, ceased to act as a body corporate, .service may be made upon any officer of any such corpora­

same are consistent with, and not repugnant thereto, and no 
further.

law of any other state government or country may prosecute in

forbidden to be done by any corporation, or by any association
of individuals, without express authority by law, and such act

upon any liability or obligation, express or implied, arising out
of, or made or entered into in consideration of, such act.

of tho attorney general, in any circuit court, such court shall 
have power to restrain, by injunction, any corporation from
assuming or exercising any franchise, liberty, or privilege, or
transacting any business, not authorized by the charter of such
corporation ; and in the same manner to restrain any individu­
als from exercising any corporate rights, privileges, or franchises, 
not granted to them by any law of this state.
SECTION 14. Such injunction may be issued before the answer, 
upon satisfactory proof that the defendants complained of have

and8. To restrain and prevent any such alienation in cases where 
it may be threatened, or there may be good reason to apprehend
that it is intended to be made.

of such corporation, or at the instance of any director, trustee,
or other officer of such corporation, having a general superin- 
tendence of its concerns. 
SECTION 18. Whenever a judgment shall be obtained against
any corporation incorporated under the laws of this state, and 
an execution issued thereon shall have been returned unsatisfled, in whole or in part, upon the petition of the person obtain-

remained insolvent for one whole year, or for one year shall have
neglected or refused to pay and discharge its notes or other evidences of debts, or for one year shall have suspended the ordi-

tion of the attorney general in behalf of this state, or on the
application of any creditor or stockholder of such corporation, 
upon complaint filed for that purpose, and upon due proof of
any of the facts in the lust section required to authorize the
issuing of the same. Whenever such injunction shall issue
against any bank, for any violation of its charter, on the appli­
cation of any creditor, the court shall proceed to final judgment
in such case, and adjudge a forfeiture, if the proof is sufficient,
notwithstanding such creditor may settle with such corporation;
and in all such cases the attorney general, under the direction
of the governor, or any creditor, shall have the right to appear
and prosecute such action ; and such action shall not be discon­
tinued, if either of them so appear and prosecute such action

demands that may be due, and the property that may belong to
such corporation, who shall in all respects be subject to the

made parties to the action, either at the commencement thereof
or in any subsequent stage of the proceedings, whenever it shall
become necessary to enforce such liability. 
SECTION 26. If any creditor of a corporation desires to make
such direct?rs or ~tockholders part~es to the action, after a Judg- 
.meut therem against the corporation, he may do so by filmg a.
~omplaint against them founded upon such judgment; and if 
such judgment was rendered in a proceeding instituted by the
attorney general, such creditor may, on his application, he made 
plaintifff therein, and may in like manner make the directors
and stockholders sought to be charged defendants in such action. 
SECTION 27. Whenever any creditor of a corporation shall
k
l
1 
di l , di
sec to c iarge t ie irectors, trustees, or ot ier superiuten mg

and shall appoint one or more receivers, who shall possess all the
powers conferred, and be subject to all tho obligations imposed,
on receivers in case of the voluntary dissolution of a corporation. 
SECTION 29. But if upon the filing of the answer, or upon the
taking of any such account, it shall appear that such corporation
is insolvent, and that it has no property or effects to satisfy such 
creditor, the court may proceed, without appointing any receiver,
to ascertain the respective liabilities of such directors and stockholders, and enforce the same · by its judgment, as in other
cases. · 
SECTION 80. Upon a final judgment being made upon any
such application to restrain a corporation, or in any action com- 
mcnced against directors or stockholders, the court shall cause a
just and fair distribution of the property of such corporation,
and of the proceeds thereof, to be made among its fair and
honest creditors, in the order and in the proportions prescribed
in tho case of a voluntary dissolution of a corporation. 
SECTION 31. In all cases in which the directors or other officers of a corporation, or the stockholders thereof, shall have been 
made parties to an action in which judgment shall be rendered,
if the property of such corporation shall be insufficient to dis- 
charge its debts, the court shall proceed to compel each stockholder to pay in the amount due and remaining unpaid on the
shares of stock held by him, or so much thereof as shall be
necessary to satisfy the debts of the company. 
SECTION 32. If the debts of the company shall remain unsatisfiod, the court shall proceed to ascertain the respective liabili- 
tios of the directors or other officers, and of the stockholders,
and to adjudge the amount payable by each, and enforce such
judgment as in other cases. 
8ECTIO~ 33. Upon any application to tho court having jurisdiction, in a.ny of the cases provided in this chapter, such court 
may compel such corporation to discover any stock, property,
things in action, or effects, alleged to belong or to have belonged
to it, the transfer and disposition thereof, and the consideration,
and all the circumstances of such disposition. 
SECTION 34. Every officer, agent, or stockholder of any corporation, against which proceedings shall be instituted accord- 
iug to the provisions of this chapter, and every person to whom
it shall be alleged that any transfer of property or effects of such
corporation has been made, or in whoso possession or control 
pelled, in tho discretion of tho court, to answer an action com­
menced to obtain any discovery in the preceding section speci­
fied, notwithstanding such answer may expose the corporation of
which he is a member, to a forfeiture of its corporate rights, or
any of them. 
35.' The answers of the officers and agents of o.ny
corporation shall be evidence against the corporation, in the 
same manner and to the same extent as if such answers had
been given upon an examination of such officers or agents as
witnesses in the cause ; and such officers or agents may subse­
quently be examined as witnesses by either party, under tho
order of the court; but no such answer shall be compelled,
unless by special order of the court. 
36. Neither the answer of any such officer or agent,
nor his testimony upon any such subsequent examination, shall 
be used as evidence· upon any indictment or other criminal
prosccu tion or proceeding against him. 
37. Whenever any action shall be commenced, or
any application shall be made, against any corporation, its direct- 
ors or other superintending officers, or its stockholders, according
to the provisions of this chapter, the court may by injunction, 011 
the application of either party, and at any stage of the proceed­
ings, restrain all proceedings by any creditor against the
defendants in such action; and whenever it shall appear neces­
sary or proper, may order notice to be published in such manner
as the court shall direct, requiring all the creditors of such cor­
poration to exhibit their. claims and become parties to the
action within a reasonable time, not less than six months from
the first publication of such order, and in default thereof, to be
precluded from all benefit of the judgment which shall be made
in such action, and from any distribution which shall be made

ground to doubt their sufficiency, he shall be liable in an action 
to the party aggrieved who may have prosecuted such action, for
tho amount of the judgment recovered by him, and for his costs
and expenses in such action ; or if such action was brought by
the attorney general or a district attorney, an action may, in
like manner, be brought by them, in the name of this state, for
the amount of the judgment so recovered; and the same disposition
of the monies collected in such action against such officer shall be
made as directed in the preceding section. 
SECTION 33. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an
offi.cer is required to keep any person arrested upon attachment 
in actual custody, and to bring him personally before any court,
the inability, from sickness or otherwise, of such person to attend 
such court personally, shall be a sufficient excuse for not bring- 
ing him before such court; nor shall any officer be required, in
any case, to confine any person arrested upon an attachment to 
answer for misconduct, in any prison, or otherwise to restrain
him of his personal liberty, except so far as shall be necessary 
to secure his personal attendance.
