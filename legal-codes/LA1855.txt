Sec. 25.—Be it enacted, &c. That all the rules of pro
ceeding which existed in this State before the promulgation of
the code of practice, except those relative to juries, recusa
tion of judges and other officers, and with respect to the com
petency of the latter, be and are hereby abrogated ; and that
all the civil laws which were in force before the promulgation
of the civil code lately promulgated, be and are hereby abro
gated, except so much of title tenth of the old civil code as is
embraced in the third chapter, which treats of the dissolution
of communities or corporations.
Sec. 26.—Be it enacted, &c. That the code of practice,
such as it has been sent to the several courts in this State in
the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five, shall be considered
as having full force of law, though its provisions are not pre
ceded by these usual words, " Be it enacted," and it had been
omitted to mention, at the end of said code, the names of the
president of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives, and of the Governor who signed the same, and of
the date when the said code was approved.
SEC. 1. —An action is the right given to every person, to
claim judicially what is due or belongs to him.
Action means also the exercise of that right, that is to
say, a judicial demand founded on a contract, or given by
law, by which the plaintifff prays that the person against
whom he proceeds, be ordered to do that which he has bound
himself towards him to perform.
14 L. 420; 17 L. 132.
CHAPTER I.
OF THE GENERAL DIVISIONS OF ACTIONS.
SEC. 2. —Actions are divided into several kinds :
The first division of actions is into personal, real, and
mixed.
SEC. 3. —A personal action is that by which a person
proceeds against one who is personally bound towards him,
either by a contract or by virtue of the law, in order to com
pel him to pay what he owes to him, or to perform what he
had promised.
This action is called personal, because it is attached to
the person bound, and follows him every where.
2 L. 94; 10 L. 216; 6 A. 481.
SEC. 4.—A real action, is that which relates to claims
made on immovable property, or to the immovable rights to
which they are subjected.
The object of this action is, the ownership or the posses
sion of such property ; and they are thereforee subdivided into
petitory and possessory actions.
SEC. 5. —The petitory action, is that by which he who
has the property of a real estate, or of a right upon, or grow
ing out of it, proceeds against the person having the possession,
in order to obtain the possession of the immovable property,
or the enjoyment of the rights upon it, to which he is en titled.
SEC. 6. —A possessory action is that by which one claims
to be maintained in the possession of an immovable property,
or of a right upon, or growing out of it, when he has been
disturbed : or to be reinstated to that possession, when he has
been divested or evicted.
SEC. 7. —A mixed action, is one which, in its nature,
partakes both of the real and of the personal action, such as
a claim for the ownership of real property, and also for the
fruits it has produced, or their value.
6 R. 466.
SEC. 8. —The second general division of actions, classes
them into civil and criminal actions.
SEC. 9. —A civil action is one which is brought for pri
vate interest, such as a suit to obtain the payment of a sum
due, the restitution of property, or reparation for an injury
done by words or action.
SEC. 10.—A criminal action is one which is instituted
in the name of the State, by its proper officers, in order to
obtain the public reparation of any crime or misdemeanor ;
this action comes under the head of penal jurisprudence.
SEC. 11.—Actions, with respect to their object, are di
vided into two classes ; those by which movables, and those
by which immovables are chumed.
SEC. 12. —Although incorporeal rights be not in reality
movables nor immovables, they are nevertheless placed by
law, in one of those two classes.
Actions tending to recover an immovable, or a real right,
or an universality of things, such as an inheritance, are con
sidered as real ; while actions for the recovery of a movable
or of a sum of money, though accompanied with a mortgage,
are not real actions.
17 L. 555.
CHAPTEE H.
OF THE RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL CIVIL ACTIONS.
SEC. 13. —The forms, the effects, and the prescription of
actions are governed by the law of the place where they are
brought : but contracts are governed by the law of the place
where they were entered into.
8 R. 262 ; 5 N. S. 585 ; 2 N. S. 96 ; 6 N. S. 631 ; 8 N. S. 8, 7 M. 213,353 ;
1 L. 225,542; 2 L. 115, 7 L. 138 ; 11 L. 464; 12 L. 534; 13 L. 446; 14 L. 305;
17 L. 458.
SEC. 14. —Every obligation gives impliedly a right of ac
tion to enforce its execution ; but the obligation and the right
of action do not always arise at the same time. Thus in con
tracts to be performed at a future period, the obligation which
grows out of the contract, arises at the very moment of mak
ing it, but the right of action growing out of it, arises only
when the stipulated term has arrived.
SEC. 15. —An action can only be brought by one having a
real and actual interest which he pursues, but as soon as that
interest arise, he may bring his action.
SEC. 16. —In all actions, which are to be brought at the
end of a stated period, the right of action subsists until the
last day has expired.
SEC. 17. —Natural obligations give no right of action, but
what has been paid pursuant to those obligations is not sub
ject to repetition.
Those are natural obligations, for which the law gives no
right of action ; they arise on contracts entered into by per
sons who, though possessed of sound discretion and judgment
enabling them to make contracts, are nevertheless disqualified
by law from contracting, as are the contracts of married
women made without the authorization of their husbands.
SEC. 18.—He who pays through error, what he does not
owe, has an action for the repetition of what he has thus paid,
unless there was a natural obligation to make such payment ;
but he must prove that he paid through error, otherwise it
shall be presumed that he intended to give.
2 L. 129; 15 L. 316; 6 L. 204; 19 L. 138; 7 R. 522.
SEC.19.—Obligations contrary to justice, good faith or
good morals, such as those by which a reward is promised to
another to commit a crime, give no right of action to either
party to enforce the execution of the contract.
But if the reward promised has been paid, no action can
be brought to obtain the repayment of the amount.
SEC.20.—He who has a right of action to claim what is
due to him, has a right yet more evident to use the same cause
of action as an exception, in order to preserve his rights.
12 R. 472.
SEC. 21.—Actions do not abate by the death of one of the
parties, after answer filed.
11 L. 360; 6 R. 44; 3 A. 547.
SEC. 22. —Actions arising from obligations are the pro
perty of him in favor of whom they have been contracted ;
they are transmitted with his estate to his heirs, who may
carry them on in their own name.
SEC. 23.—The universal successor, or successors, by an
universal title of a deceased person, such as bis heirs, or uni
versal legatees, are entitled to the same actions and exceptions,
as the person to whom they succeed ; but they cannot claim,
on their own behalf, any right which he had not himself, for
this reason, that no one can transfer a better title to another
than that which he himself had.
2L. 514.
SEC. 24.—The rule laid down in the preceding article
takes place also with respect to the successors of a deceased
person claiming a thing by virtue of a particular title ; that is
to say, by sale, donation, or legacy, but so far only as concerns
the thing itself, of which the deceased has thus disposed of in
their favor.
SEC. 25.—Heirs or universal legatees may be sued for civil
reparation of the injury caused by the crimes or misdemeanors
of the deceased, whose succession they have accepted, although
no action was instituted for that purpose against the deceased
during his life, and although neither he nor his hens have
been benefited by such an offense.
CHAPTER III.
OF THE RULES PECULIAR TO THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIVIL
ACTIONS.
Sec. I.—Of the several kinds of Personal Actions, and of
the rules lohich govern them.
SEC. 26.—A personal action lies against him who has
bound himself towards another, personally and independently
of the property which he possesses.
10 L. 210.
SEC. 27.—Such action can only be brought against the
debtor, or the obligor, or the person who directly represents
him, such as universal heirs, or heirs by an universal title.
SEC. 28. —Personal actions are grounded on one of the
four causes which give rise to personal obligations. These causes
are contracts, or quasi contracts, offenses, or quasi offenses.
SEC. 29. —Personal actions arise from contracts, where one
has bound himself for his own advantage, as by selling, pur
chasing, hiring or letting, or by any like contracts.
1 L. 36 ; 10 L. 164, 216.
SEC. 30. — Personal actions arise from quasi contracts,
when they are grounded on the obligations imposed upon him
who has managed the affairs of another, without being au
thorized.
7 N. S. 140; 11 L. 2S6 ; 2 R. 1 ; 5 R. 91.
SEC. 31. —Personal actions arise from offenses, as when
one has become liable to another for the injury he has inflicted
on him by some crime or offense, such as theft or slander.
2 L. 94 ; 6 A. 354.
SEC. 32. —Personal actions arise from quasi offenses, when
the ground of action is the injury done to another, by one of
those faults which are not considered as real crimes or offenses.
7 N. S. 410; 8 N. S. 588 ; 7 L. 531, 586; 10 L. 131, 288, 581.
SEC. 33. —Personal actions arising from contracts, are di
vided into direct and equitable actions.
SEC. 34. —A direct contra-distinguished from an equi
table action, is that which arises immediately from contracts,
and binds ipso facto all who have been parties to it.
SEC. 35. —An equitable action, is that which does not im
mediately arise from a contract, but from equity, in favor of a
third person, not a party to it, and for whose benefit certain
stipulations have been made : thus if one stipulated in a con
tract entered into with another person, and as an express con
dition of that contract, that this person shall pay a certain
sum on his account, or give a certain thing to a third person,
not a party to the act, that third person has an equitable ac
tion against the one who has contracted the obligation, to
enforce the execution of the stipulation.
5 R. 240 ; 6 R. 407 9 R. 19,48; 1 A. 280,372; 2 A. 940 ; 3 A. 129 ; 5 A. 225.
SEC. 36—Certain contracts, from their nature, give rise
to two species of personal actions, . in favor of the contracting
parties ; one of these is likewise termed direct, in contra-distinction to the other which is called a contrary action.
SEC. 37. —A direct action, in this acceptation, is that
which arises out of a contract at the very moment of its being
made, without the occurrence of any new cause since the con
tract ; as, in the contract of loan termed commodat, where
the action arises in favor of the owner of the thing against
him to whom he has lent it, in order to recover it.
SEC. 38. —The contrary action, is that which arises from
some cause which has occurred since the contract, and has for
its object the obtaining of some indemnity, such as the action
which the law gives to the borrower in the loan called commo
dat, for the recovery of the disbursements which he has been
obliged to make for the preservation of the thing lent to him.
SEC. 39. —It is of the essence of all synallagmatic con
tracts, that is to say of those which contain reciprocal obliga
tions between the parties, to give rise to two species of direct
actions.
Thus, in the contract of sale, the purchaser has an action
against the seller to compel him to deliver the thing sold, and
the vendor has likewise his action against the purchaser, to
compel him to pay the price.
8 L. 1, 181; 10 L. 19; 11 L. 239.
SEC. 40.—Personal actions, being attached to the person
of the debtor, may be brought against all his heirs, should he
die "without having extinguished it, but each of them will
only be liable for the amount and portion which he has inher
ited from the debtor's estate.
Seo. II. Of the real action, its subdivisions, and the rides
peculiar to it.
SEC. 41.—A real action lies against him who, without
having contracted any obligation towards the plaintifff, is nev
ertheless bound towards hint, as possessor of the immovable
property of which that plaintifff claims the ownership or the
possession, or on which he claims to exercise some immovable
right.
SEC. 42. —The real action gives the right to follow the
thing in whatever hands it may be found ; but as relates to
hypothecary actions, this rule is subject to some modifications
which are established in the paragraph which treats of that
action.
4 A. 553.
1. Of the petitory action.
SEC. 43.—The petitory action, or one by which real pro
perty, or any immovable right to such property may be sub
jected, is claimed, must be brought against the person, who is
in the actual possession of the immovable, even if the person
having the possession be only the farmer or lessee.
But if the farmer or lessee of a real estate be sued for
that cause of action, he must declare to the plaintifff the name
and the residence of his lessor, who shall be made a party to
the suit, if he reside in the State, or is represented therein,
and who must defend it in the place of the tenant, who shall
be discharged from the suit.
4 N. S. 391; 5 N. S. 71, 232; 5 L. 356; 4 R. 29; 5 R. 314; 12 R. 489;
2 A. 487 ; 3 A. 637.
SEC. 44. —The plaintifff in an action of revendication must
make out his title, otherwise the possessor, whoever he be, shall
be discharged from the demand.
Akt. 45. —The petitory action may be brought by one
who has the ownership only of an undivided part of an estate,
or of a real right to which such an estate is subjected, though
his ownership may be limited to a certain period, or end by
the occurrence of a certain event.
8 N. a 171.
•
2. Of the j>ossessory action, and of the rules which govern it.
SEC. 46. —The possessory action, which is a branch of
real actions, may be brought by any possessor of a real estate,
or of a real right, who is disturbed either in the possession of
the estate or in the enjoyment of the right, against him who
causes the disturbance, in order to be maintained in, or restor
ed to the possession, whether he has been evicted or disturbed ;
provided his possession be accompanied by the qualifications
hereafter required ; slaves being classed as real property are
likewise subject to the possessory action.
5 N. S. 233 ; 8 N. S. 171 ; 7 N S. 487 ; 2 L. 227 ; 3 L. 415 ;- 6 L. 58, 559 ;
6L. 56; 7 L. 155,415; 9L.158: 10 L. 140,442,465 ; 12L.2; 15 L. 140,452,561 ;
16 L. 29,45 ; 19 L. 253 1 R. 35, 109,163 ; 3 A. 339.
SEC. 47. —The possessors entitled to bring these actions,
are those who possess as owners.
Persons entitled to the usufruct, or to the use of a real es
tate or slaves, and others having real rights growing from such
real estate or slaves, may also bring their action, when disturb
ed in the enjoyment of their rights.
2 L. 227 ; 7L.6; 1R. 142,159 ; 6 R. 100 ; 7 R. 149 ; 10 R. 107 ; 2 A. 357.
SEC. 48. —Those who possess in the name of another, such
as tenants, are not entitled to the possessory action, when dis
turbed in the enjoyment of the real estate which they possess
in that quality, or even when they are expelled ; but they
have their remedy against the person in whose name they pos
sess, and they arc bound to apprise him of the disturbance
they have experienced, by personal notice, if he be within the
State, and by advertisements in the newspapers, if he be out
of the State, in order that he may quiet them, if it can be
done, otherwise they lose all right to claim damages from him,
and will be liable to him besides for all the loss and damages
which he may have sustained through their neglect.
10 R. 407; 2 A. 357.
SEC. 49.—In order that the possessor of a real estate or
slave, or one who claims a right to which such estate may be
subjected, may be entitled to bring a possessory action, it is
required :
1. That he should have had the real and actual posses
sion of the property, at the instant when the disturbance oc
curred : a mere civil, or legal possession, is not sufficient ;
2. That he should have had that possession quietly and
without interruption, by virtue of one of the titles prescribed
in the 47th article, for more than a year previous to his being
disturbed ; provided the possession of less than one year be
sufficient, in case the possessor should have been evicted by
force or by fraud ;
3. That he should have suffered a real disturbance either
in fact or in law ;
4. That he should have brought his suit, at the latest,
within the year in which the disturbance took place.
When the possession of the plaintifff is accompanied with
all those circumstances, it matters not whether he possesses in
good or in bad faith, or even as an usurper, he shall, neverthe
less, be entitled to his possessory action.
7 N. S. 486; 6 L. 56; 7 L. 6,414; 9 L. 152; 10 L. 140,465; 1 R. 142,159;
6 R. 1 ; 10 R. 407 ; 2 A. 205 ; 3 A. 339.
SEC. 50. —The disturbance which gives rise to the posses
sory action may be of two kinds : disturbance in fact, or dis
turbance in law.
SEC. 51.—Disturbance in fact occurs, when one, by any
act, prevents the possessor of a real estate, or of a right grow
ing from such an estate, from enjoying the same quietly, or
throws any obstacle in the way of that enjoyment, or evicts
him through violence, or otherwise.
SEC. 52. —Disturbance in law takes place, when one, pre
tending to be the possessor of a real estate, says that he is dis
turbed by the real possessor, and brings against the latter the
possessory action ; for in such a case, the true possessor is dis
turbed by this action, and may also bring a possessory action,
in order to be quieted in his possession.
But in no case shall the mere demand in revendication of
a real estate, or of a real right, be considered as a disturbance
in the enjoyment of a possessor, and entitle him to bring a
possessory action.
SEC. 53. —The plaintifff in a possessory action, needs only,
in order to make out his case, to prove that he was in posses
sion of the property in question, in the manner required by
this Code, and that he has been either disturbed or evicted
within the year previous to his suit.
So that when the possession of the plaintifff, or the act of
disturbing him is denied, no testimony shall be admitted, ex
cept as to the fact of the possession, or as to the act of dis
turbance, and all testimony relative to property shall be re
jected.
7 N. S. 486 ; 6 L. 56 ; 7 L. 6,414 ; 9 L. 152 ; 3 A. 339.
SEC. 54.—If the possessor, who has been disturbed in, or
evicted from his possession, bring a petitory action, that is to
say, claim the ownership of the property, he shall not after
wards be entitled to the possessory, by dismissing the petitory
action.
The same rule shall govern, if he sue at the same time for
the possession and the ownership of the property ; he shall
then be considered as having renounced the possessory in
order to resort to the petitory action.
SEC. 55. —Petitory and possessory actions shall not be cu
mulated, or joined together, except by consent of parties.
Therefore, he who is sued in a possessory action, cannot
bring a petitory action, until after judgment shall have been
rendered in the possessory action, and until, if he has been
condemned, he shall have satisfied the judgment given against
him.
SEC. 56. —Nevertheless, if the judgment rendered in a
possessory action, require a settlement, which may occasion
delay, then the judge shall fix a term for making such settle
ment, at the end of which the petitory action may be brought.
SEC. 57.—If the plaintifff, in a possessory action, consent
that it be cumulated with the petitory action, he shall be con
sidered as having renounced the possessory action, and the
judgment shall decide only the question of ownership.
SEC. 58.—When each of the parties, in a possessory ac
tion, alleges that he has the possession of the property, and
both of them bring suit on the allegation of having been dis
turbed in their possession, if the fact of the possession be
doubtful and uncertain, the judge shall maintain in possession
the one of the parties, who shall appear to him to have the
most apparent possession, or he may, at the request of one of
the parties, order the sequestration of the property, until the
question of ownership shall have been decided.
7 L. 1 ; 2 A. 219.
SEC. 59.—If one who is disturbed in, or evicted from his
possession, suffer a year to elapse without bringing a posses
sory action, that action shall be prescribed, and he must then
resort to a petitory action.
SEC. 60. —Possessory actions cannot be maintained for
personal property ; the action in revendication for that species
of property, having nothing in common with the extraordinary
privileges secured to the owners of real estate, or of real rights,
when they are disturbed in their enjoyment.
3. Of the Hypothecary Action and of its Rules.
SEC. 61. —An hypothecary action ia a real action, which
the creditor brings againt the property which has been hy
pothecated to him by his debtor, in order to have it seized and
sold for the payment of his debt.
4 L. 452; 11 R. 209; 1 A. 204.
SEC. 62.—The hypothecary action, like all real actions,
follows the property to which it is attached, in whatever hand
it may be found, but it is subject to different rules, according
as the property may be in the possession of the debtor, of his
heirs, or of third persons.
5 N. S. 50 ; 4 L. 447 ; 9 L. 1 ; 10 L. 490 ; 11 L. 419 ; 1 A. 204.
SEC. 63. —When the hypothecated property is in the
hand of the debtor, and when the creditor, besides his hypo
thecary right, has against his debtor a title importing a confes
sion of judgment, he shall be entitled to have the hypothecat
ed property seized immediately and sold, for the payment of
his debt, including the capital, the interest, and the costs,
pursuant to the rules provided hereafter for executory pro
ceedings.
4 N. S. 196; 8 L. 257; 11 L.50; 13 L.512; 16 L. 233; 1 R.295; 11 R. 209;
1 A. 204, 279.
SEC. 64. —If the creditor has no executory title against
his debtor, and the latter be in possession of the hypothecated
property, the former can only seize and sell such property, af
ter having obtained judgmeat against the debtor in the usual
form.
2 L. 132 ; 6 L. 51.' ; 11 R. 209 ; 1 A. 204.
SEC. 65. —If the debtor has died, leaving a single heir,
who has accepted the succession, the hypothecary creditor
may act against that heir, in the same manner as he would
have done against the debtor himself, that is to say, either by
pursuing the executory or the ordinary mode of proceeding,
according to the tenor of the hypothecary act.
1 A. 204.
SEC. 66.—If, on the contrary, the deceased debtor leaves
several heirs, and they have accepted the succession, in such a
case it must be ascertained whether the hypothecary act im
ports a confession of judgment or not.
If so, and there have been no partition of the estate among
the heirs, the creditor shall be entitled to seize and sell the
hypothecated property, as if the original debtor were still
alive.
Bnt if there has been a partition among the heirs, and the
hypothecated property has fallen to the share of one or more
of them, the creditor may obtain an order of seizure against
those heirs, and sell the property for the amount of his claim,
leaving to them their recourse against their co-heirs for their
proportion of the debt.
l A. 204.
SEC. 67. —But if the hypothecary act do not import con
fession of judgment, the creditor cannot seize and sell the hy
pothecated property in the possession of the heirs of his debt
or, or of any one of them, until he has obtained a judgment
against each one of the heirs, for such a part of the debt as
he is bound to pay, according to the share he has inherited,
unless the creditor prefer to have the judgment executed per
sonally against the heirs or their property, for such sums as
each of them has been adjudged to pay.
1 A. 204.
SEC. 68. —If the hypothecated property be neither in the
possession of his debtor nor of his heirs, but in that of a third
person, the creditor has his action against that person, in or
der to compel him either to give up the property, or pay the
amount for which it stands hypothecated. This is the hy
pothecary action, properly speaking.
a N. a 505 ; 4 N. 8. 402 ; 6 N. S. 651 ; 8 IT. S. 403 ; 1 L. 29; 2 L. 135;
1L. 488; 8 L. 257; 10L. 194,490; 12 L. 296; 13 L. 313; 14 L. 133; 15 L. 188;
16 L. 223; 2 A. 367.
SEC. 69.—If, thirty days after the amicable demand, made
from the debtor or his heirs, of the payment of an hypotheca
ry debt, it has not been fully discharged, the creditor may
bring his action against the third possessor of the property
hypothecated to him, to have it seized and sold ; if that third
possessor have not, within the ten days, after having been no
tified of such a demand, paid the amount of the hypothecary
debt, including the interest and costs.
4 N. S. 402 ; 6 N. S. 309, 405, 627 ; 1 N. S. 577 ; 8 N. S. 95 ; 2 L. 132,544;
4L. 305,323,125,477 ; 6 L. 59,277 ; 11 L. 419; 15 L. 184,188; 16 L. 223 ; 19
L. 154: 1 R. 135.
SEC. 70. —-But the creditor, who brings this action must
declare on oath, in the petition, that the debt on which he de
mands the seizure of the hypothecated property, is really due
to him, and that he has in vain demanded payment from his
debtor, thirty days previous to his bringing his suit.
See notes to art. 69.
SEC. 71. —Nevertheless, if the third possessor, against
whom the action is brought, be not personally bound for the
payment of the debt, he may oppose the sale of the hypoth
ecated property, if there be other hypothecated property in
the possession of the original debtor, and require its previous
discussion, pending which, the proceedings, as to the sale of
the property, shall be stayed.
16 L. 223; 9 R. 69.
SEC. 72.—The third possessor, who requires discussion,
shall be bound to designate to the plaintifff the property of the
principal debtor, which he wishes to have discussed, and ad
vance the costs required for carrying on the necessary proceed
ings, in order to execute this discussion.
He is not entitled to demand the discussion of such pro
perty of the principal debtor, which may be out of the juris
diction of the tribunal of the place where the payment was to
have been made, nor that of property in dispute, or out of the
possession of the debtor.
7 N. S. 199; 7 L. 278; 11 L. 133.
SEC. 73. —The exception of discussion cannot be opposed to
the privileged creditor, or to one who has a special hypothe
cation.
SEC. 74.—Third possessors of property which has heen
seized, owing to their failure of discharging the amount of the
hypothecary deht, within ten days after having been notified
that payment has been demanded of the hypothecary debt,
may, until the very day of the sale, retain possession of the
hypothecated property, by paying the debt with interest, and
all the costs incurred in the suit.
CHAPTEB IV.
WHERE ACTIONS ARE TO BE BROUGHT, AND IN WHAT MANNER.
SEC. 75.—Actions must be brought before competent
judges.
Sec. I.—Of Judges ; tlieir Jurisdiction ; how tJieir com
petency is regulated.
SEC. 76. —Jurisdiction means the power of him who has
the right of judging, or sometimes that word means also the
space or extent of country over. which the judge is entitled to
exercise that power.
SEC. 77.—Degrees of jurisdiction, means the different tri
bunals before which the same suit may be successively plead
ed, and the rules established for proceeding in an inferior
jurisdiction*, previous to taking the suit before a superior juris
diction.
SEC. 78. —There are several kinds of jurisdictions, accord
ing to the nature and the extent of the powers delegated to
the judge exercising it.
SEC. 79. —The first division is into civil and criminal ju
risdiction.
SEC. 80. —Civil jurisdiction extends to all civil matters,
and criminal jurisdiction comprises whatever relates to crimes
and misdemeanors.
SEC. 81.—Some judges exercise general, whilst otheiB pos
sess only special jurisdiction.
Judges having general jurisdiction, are those, who, in vir
tue of the law, take cognizance of all matters but such as are
specially excepted from their jurisdiction.
Judges having special jurisdiction are such as have an ex
clusive jurisdiction in certain cases pointed out by law.
Constitution of 1852. Art. 61. —The Judiciary power
shall be vested in a Supreme Court, in such Inferior Courts as
the Legislature may, from time to time, order and establish,
and in Justices of the Peace.
Stat. 28th April, 1853. No.181. § 1.—Be it enacted by the
Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Louisiana,
in General Assembly convened, That there shall be elected in
and for each Judicial District of the State, (the first Judicial
District excepted,) by the qualified voters thereof, one Judge
for the term of four years, who shall receive a salary of twentyfive
hundred dollars per annum, payable quarterly on his own
warrant, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise ap
propriated.
2.—Be it further enacted, &c, That the jurisdiction of
the District Court and the powers, duties and responsibilities
of the District Judges to be elected under this act, shall re
main the same as are now established by law, subject to such
modifications as may hereafter be made by the General As
sembly.
1 A. 146.
Constitution of 1845. Art. 78—The District Courts shall
have original jurisdiction in all civil cases, when the amount in
dispute exceeds fifty dollars, exclusive of interest. In all
criminal cases, and in all matters connected with succession,
their jurisdiction shall be unlimited.
SEC. 82.—There are judges having an exclusive jurisdic
tion, such as the special judges mentioned in the preceding subdivision.
There are judges with concurrent jurisdiction, that is to
say, having cognizance in matters of the same nature, though
they hold their courts in the same place or district.
SEC. 83. —There are judges having equal jurisdiction, that
is to say, that though they can only take cognizance of cases
arising within a certain space, they have a similar jurisdiction
as to the nature of cases which may be brought before them.
SEC. 84.—There are judges of original, and judges of ap
pellate jurisdiction.
Judges having original jurisdiction, are those before whom
suits are brought in the first instance.
Judges having appellate jurisdiction, are those before whom '
appeals are brought by those who complain of the judgment
of the court of the first instance, and" who try the cause again,
affirming or reversing the judgment of the inferior court.
SEC. 85. —The decision of some judges are subject to ap
peal, others decide in the last resort.
Judges subject to appeal, are those whose decisions may be
carried by appeal before a superior court, having appellate ju
risdiction.
Judges in the last resort, are those whose judgment cannot
be appealed from. .
SEC. 86. —In matters of jurisdiction, the right given to a
judge to take cognizance of certain causes, against certain
persons within his jurisdiction, is termed competency.
SEC. 87.—In order to ascertain whether a judge be com
petent or not, three points must be taken into consideration :
1. The object or the amount in dispute ;
2. The person of the defendant ;
3. The place where the action is to be brought.
SEC. 88.—To determine on the competency of a judge, as
relates to the object or amount in dispute before him, it is ne
cessary to examine what are his powers, what is the nature of
the cause, and what is the amount of the sum.
SEC. 89.—To determine his competency, as relates to the
person of the defendant, the rule which requires that the de
fendant be sued at the place of his domicil or usual residence
must be observed. This rule is subject, however, to various
exceptions, determined in the chapter which treats of judicial
demands and of citations.
1 L. 223 ; 6 R. 6.
SEC. 90. —To determine on his competency, as relates to
the place where the action is brought, we must be governed
by the rule which provides that a judge shall not exercise
any jurisdiction beyond the limits of the territory assigned to
him.
SEC. 91. —When the jurisdiction of the judge, before
whom a suit is brought, is limited to a certain sum, the ques
tion of jurisdiction must be decided by the amount claimed, and
not by the sum actually due, not including, however, the in
terest, and the costs which have been subsequently incurred.
But if one, in order to give jurisdiction to a judge, de
mand a sum below that which is really due to him, he shall be
presumed to have remitted the overplus, and after having ob
tained judgment for the sum he had claimed, he shall lose all
right of action for that overplus.
2 R. 207 ; 5 R. 90 ; See Art. 156.
SEC. 92. —The consent of parties cannot render a judge
competent to tiy a cause, which from its nature cannot be
brought before him, or when the amount in dispute exceeds
the sum over which he has jurisdiction. All judgments, ren
dered in contravention of this provision, shall be void.
2 R. 54 ; BR. 204.
SEC. 93. —If one be cited before a judge, whose jurisdic
tion does not extend to the place of his domicil or of his usual
residence, but who is competent to decide the case brought
before him, and he plead to the merit, instead of declining the
jurisdiction, the judgment given shall be valid, except the de
fendant be a minor.
2L. 224; 11 R.77.
SEC. 94.—The same cause cannot be brought before two
separate courts, though they be possessed of concurrent juris
diction, except by discontinuing the suit first brought befori
the answer is filed.
Hence, if the same suit be brought before two separate
courts, having concurrent jurisdiction, the judge, before whom
the action was brought first, shall sustain his jurisdiction, and
the defendant shall be entitled to have the cause dismissed by
the other court, and to recover costs.
Nevertheless, if the defendant, instead of claimng to be
dismissed, answer in the two actions, in the two separate
courts, the first judgment rendered by either of them shall be
valid and executory against the party cast in the action. All
proceedings shall be staid in the other court, and the plaintifff
dismissed after paying the costs.
Sec. II.—Of the mode of bringing civil suits, of suits, and of
parties litigant.
SEC. 95. —Actions are brought before the courts by what
is termed suit.
SEC. 96. —A suit is a real, personal, or mixed demand,
made before a competent judge, by which the parties pray to
obtain their right, and a decision of their disputes.
In that acceptation, the words, suit, process and cause, are
almost synonymous.
SEC. 97. —Civil actions may be prosecuted, according to
the nature of the case, by three kinds of proceedings, to wit :
Ordinary, executory, or summary.
8 N. S. 95.
SEC. 98.—The proceedings are ordinary, when citation
takes place, and all the delays and forms of law are observed.
They are executory, when seizure is obtained against the
property of the debtor, without previous citation, in virtue of
an act or title importing confession of judgment, or in other
cases provided by law.
They are summary, when carried on with rapidity, and
without the observance of the formalities required in ordinary
cases, as when courts provide for the administration of vacant
successions, and the property of minors and absent heirs.
8 L. 257 ; 3 A. 434.
SEC. 99. —In order to constitute a suit or action, there
must be, at least, two parties present, or duly represented,
though one of the two may fail to appear ; it is thereforee that
they are called the principal parties to the suit.
6 N. S. 517 ; 4 L. 158 ; 5 L. 424 ; 17 L. 479.
SEC. 100. —The plaintifff is he who sues another for some
thing which he says is due, or belongs to him.
The defendant is the one against whom this suit is
brought.
SEC. 101. —Besides the plaintifff and the defendant, there
are often other parties to the suit, such as warrantors, third
persons intervening, and parties opposing ; but such parties,
whether plaintifffs or defendants, as the case may be, are only
so, incidentally and subsidiarily.
CHAPTER V.
WHAT PERSONS ARE ENTITLED TO BRING ACTIONS.
SEC. 102. —Those who are disqualified from contracting
are generally disqualified from suing.
The exceptions to this rule are provided in the following articles.
SEC. 103.—Slaves cannot sue, either as plaintifffs, or as
defendants, except as relates to their freedom.
But the earnings of slaves, and the price of their service,
belong to their owners, who have their action to recover the
amount from those who have employed them.
Stat. 30th, May, 1846, p. 153 —From the passage of this
act, no slave shall be entitle to his or her freedom under the
pretense that he or she has been, with or without the
consent of his or her owner, in a country where slavery does
not exist, or in any of the States where slavery is prohibited.
6 N. S. 418 ; 7 N. S. 350; 3 L. 170 ; 9 L. 156 ; 3 A. 556.
SEC. 104. Children, as long as they are subject to pater
nal power, that is to say, while their fathers and mothers are
living, and they, not emancipated, cannot bring suit against
them.
SEC. 105.—A married woman, cannot sue her husband, as
long as the marriage continues, except it be to obtain a sepa
ration from bed and board, or for the restitution and enjoy
ment of her paraphernal property, or in case she holds her
property separate from him, by her marriage contract ; but in
every case, she cannot sue, without the authorization of the
court before which she brings her action.
Stat. 7th April, 1826, p. 166.—§ 1. The article one hun
dred and five be amended so as to make the English corres
pond with the French text by inserting after the words " bed
and board," the words " or for the separation of property."
2 L. 29 ; 1 R. 230, 468.
SEC. 106.—A married woman, whether she be of age, or
a minor, cannot appear in court against any one, without the
authorization of her husband, although she may be a public
merchant, carrying on her trade separate from him, unless she
has obtained a separation from bed and board, by virtue of a
jugdment duly executed, or has been regularly divorced.
3 N. S 515; 4 N. S. 388; 1 R. 230,468; 2 R. 368 ; 6 R. 77 : 2 A. 879: 5 A. 631;
SEC. 107. —Husbands have, under their control, the per
sonal and possessory actions to which their wives are entitled,
though they be themselves minors ; thereforee, they can pro
ceed judicially, and in their own name, in whatever relates to
the preservation of the dotal property, which their wives have
brought to them by marriage, as well as to the recovering of
the debts due them, these being under their administration.
But actions, relating to the ownership of the dotal or pa
raphernal property of the wife, or of some real right belonging
to her, must be brought by the wife, duly authorized by her
husband, or by the judge, if he fails to do it.
3 N. S. 515; 2 L. 29; 9 L.M8; 4 E. 37,114; 6 R. 77,154; 2 A. 879; 5 A. 631 ;
SEC. 108.—Minors, persons interdicted, or absent, cannot
sue, except through the intervention, or with the assistance of
their tutors or curators.
5 N. S. 677; 8 N. S. 665; 2 L. 142; 6 L. 493 ; 7 L. 216,559; 9 L. 234; 10
L. 14,454; 3 R. 119; 7 E. 167.
SEC. 109.—When minors are under the age of puberty,
their tutors act themselves, in all judicial proceedings, in
the name of their minors, in all the suits which may be
brought for them, without making them parties to those ac
tions.
The curators of persons interdicted, or absent, act judi
cially in the name of those whom they represent, in the same
manner as the tutors of minors, under the age of puberty.
SEC. 110.—When minors have attained the age of puber
ty, they appear themselves, and in their own names, in all
their suits ; but they must be assisted by the curators ad lites
appointed to assist them generally in all suits, or specially for
any one suit, unless they have been emancipated by marriage,
in which case, the minor husband may act, without the assist
ance of any curator.
The office of "Curator ad lites" is abolished by the 9th section of stat. 11th
March, 1830, p. 48. See Civil Code, art. 357, and amendments. 4 L. 477;
6 L. 231.
SEC. 111.—The curators of vacant successions, or of ab
sent heirs, may bring all kinds of actions, relating to their ad
ministration, in their own name, and in their quality, without
being obliged to mention the name of the heirs they represent,
because it is often uncertain whether such heirs exist, and their
names are generally unknown.
5 L. 472; 15 L. 492; 1 R. 108; 1 A. 76.
SEC. 112.—Bodies corporate, and chartered institutions,
act judicially through their proper representatives, under the
name or title given to them in their act of incorporation.
8 L. Ill ; 2 A. 897.
SEC. 113.—As the right of action may be transmitted, it
passes to the heirs ; thereforee, the heirs of the deceased may
sue the debtor of the succession, in the same manner as the
deceased himself could have done.
But actions being divisible, if there be several heirs, each
may sue for his separate share, in the same manner as each is
only bound, pro rata, of his share for the debts of the succes
sion.
6 N. S. 292; 5 L. 363; I5 L. 514; 16 L. 31 ; 18 L. 41 ; 19 L. 403,405; 1 E.

CHAPTER VI.
AGAINST WHOM ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT.
SEC. 114.—Civil actions can only be brought against such
slaves, as are claimed as slaves, and allege that they are free.
As relates to the damages which they may occasion by their
offenses and quasi offenses, the person aggrieved must sue the
owner, who is bound to repay them, unless he should prefer to
let the offending slave be seized and sold, in order that the
damages sustained may be satisfied out of the proceeds.
7 L. 586 ; 9 L. 341.
SEC. Il5.—Actions against interdicted persons, or minors
under the age of puberty, must be brought directly against
the tutor of the minor, or the curator of the interdicted
person.
If the minor be above the age of puberty, the suit must
be brought, both against him and against his curator ad lites,
unless he be a husband, emancipated by marriage, in which
case he may be sued alone ; if the minor be absent, the suit
may be brought against his curator ad lites, who shall answer
both in his own name, and in that of the minor.
See note to art. 110.
SEC. 116. —If the minor, whether under or above the age
of puberty, against whom one intends to institute a suit, has
no tutor, nor curator ad lites, the plaintifff must demand that
a curator ad hoc be named to defend the suit. The same
course must be pursued, if the person intended to be sued, be
absent and not represented in the State.
2N. S. 554 ; 3 N. S. 178; 4 N. S, 185, 431,680; 6 N. S. 15; 1 L.83; 2 L. 467;

15 L. 37,83; 6 R. 142,189; 2 A. 562,916,1010 -. 3 A. 562.
SEC. 117.—When the tutor of a minor under the age of
puberty, has interests opposed to those of his ward, he cannot
sue him, except by making the under tutor defendant in the
cause.
SEC. 118. —When one intends to sue a married woman,
for a cause of action relative to her own separate interest, the
suit must be brought, both against her and her husband.
Should her husband be absent, the plaintifff must demand
that she be authorized by the judge before whom the suit is
brought, to defend it alone, if she be of age ; if she be a mi
nor, he must pray for the nomination of a curator ad hoc, to
assist her in her defense.
Nevertheless if she be divorced or separated from her hus
band, from bed and board, by a judgment duly executed, she
may be sued alone, without the authorization of her husband
or of the judge being required.
4 N. S. 388 ; 2 L. 36 ; 4 L. 259 ; 6 L. 639 ; 10 L. 401,574 ; 2 R. 368 ; 6 R. 127,
407 ; 9 R. 192; 2 A. 879.
SEC. 119.—Suits against corporations, corporate bodies or
chartered companies, must be brought against them under
their legal titles.
SEC. 120.—If one against whom there was a cause of ac
tion, die, leaving one heir only, the suit shall bo carried on
against such heir, as it would have been against the deceased.
If the suit had already been brought against the deceased,
and he had not answered, it shall not be interrupted, but shall
be continued against the heir, by a mere citation or notice
served on him to that effect, within the delay for original cita
tions, according as the distance may be from his domicil to the
court where the action has been brought.
If, on the contrary, the deceased have two, or more heirs,
the plaintifff may proceed personally against each of them, for
the share which he inherits, if that share be sufficiently
known and ascertained by an inventory, or partition ; other
wise, they can only be sued, each for a virile portion, that is
to say, for an equal part of the debt, dividing it in as many
parts as there are heirs.
If the suit had been already commenced against the de
ceased, it shall be continued against his several heirs, by citing
each of them separately, as if there were only one, but judg
ment can only be given personally against each, for his hered
itary share, or virile portion, as above provided.
3 N. S. 523 ; 5 N. S. 427 ; 1 L. 1 1 1 ; 3 L. 527 ; 5 L. 361 ; 8 L. 527 ; 10 L. 396 ;
12 L. 429 ; 5 R. 224,473 ; 6 R. 44 ; 11 R. 37 ; 2 A. 484.
SEC. 121.—The hypothecary creditors of a person de
ceased, have, besides their action against each of his heirs, as
provided in the preceding article, an hypothecary action
against such of the heirs, who have possession of some prop
erty, subject to their hypothecation.
This action lies for the whole amount of the debt, whether
the heir, thus sued, possesses the whole, or only a part of the
hypothecated property ; he has, however, his recourse against
his co-heirs, for the share which they are bound to contribute
towards the payment of the debt.
The heir, against whom the hypothecary action is institu
ted, may be discharged, by relinquishing such hypothecated
property as may have fallen to his share, if there has been a
partition, or his undivided share of such property, if the pro
perty has not been divided.
But this relinquishment shall not free the heir from his
liability to the personal action, in case the creditor should pre
fer to proceed against him directly, rather than to resort to
the hypothecary action, or in case the proceeds of the sale of
the hypothecated property should be insufficient to discharge
the debt.
SEC. 122. —All kinds of actions may be brought against
vacant successions, when all the heirs are absent and not rep
resented in the State, provided they be instituted against the
curator appointed to administer the succession.
The judgments rendered against the curator, are as valid
and efficacious, as if they had been rendered against the heirs
themselves.
But if some of the heirs of the deceased are present, or
represented in the State, the suit must be brought against the
heir present, or represented, as well as against the curator of
those who are absent.
2 L. 255; 3 L. 274; f R. 206; 8 R. 488.
SEC. 123.—Testamentary executors may appear, and de
fend all the actions brought against the succession they ad
minister, when none of the heirs are present or represented
in the State ; but if all the heirs, or any one of them, be pre
sent or represented, none but personal actions can be brought
against the testamentary executor alone. All real actions, such
as those of revendication, and the like, must be brought both
against the testamentary executor and the heirs present or
represented.
SEC. 124.—The rules of proceedings, contained in the
present title, relate only to the district and parish courts of
the State, when in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction.
Special rules are hereafter established for courts of pro
bates and justices of the peace.
CHAPTEK I.
OF COURTS OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION, AND THEIR POWERS.
SEC. 125. —The limits of the territorial jurisdiction of the
several district and parish courts in this state, are established
by special statutes.
SEC. 126.—The jurisdiction of district courts, excepting
the court of the first district, extends over all civil cases,
when the amount in dispute exceeds fifty dollars.
Their judgments are in the last resort in all the causes,
when the amount in dispute is under three hundred, and ex
ceeds fifty dollars ; for all larger sums, an appeal lies from
their judgment. The court of the first district has the same
jurisdiction, except in causes originating in the city of New
Orleans, where the said court exercises original jurisdiction in
cases ahove one hundred dollars and upwards, and without ap
peal from one hundred to three hundred dollars.
Stat. 10th February, 1841, p. 16. § 11. —Whenever a con
flict of privileges arises between different creditors, all the suits
and claims shall be transferred to the court by whose mandate
the property on which the privilege or right of mortgage is to
be exercised, was first seized either on mesne process or on de
finitive execution ; and said courst shall proceed to class said
privileges and rights of mortgage according to their rank and
dignity, in a summary manner, after notifying all parties inter
ested.
See amendments to Art. 81.
Editoh's Note. —Parish and Probate Courts and the City Courts of New
Orleans no longer existing, it is not deemed necessary to note the vast num
ber of cases that have been decided arising out of questions of conflict of ju
risdiction.
SEC. 127.—The parish and city courts of New Orleans
have a concurrent jurisdiction with the first district court,
subject to the same restrictions and rules.
SEC. 128.—The parish courts, except that of the parish
of Orleans, have jurisdiction in all civil cases, when the value
in dispute does not exceed three hundred dollars.
Their decisions are in the last resort, when the value in
dispute does not exceed fifty dollars, and subject to appeal
when it exceeds that sum ; but an appeal lies in all cases
where the right to real property is in question, or where the
legality of a tax, or of some toll is disputed.
See amendements to Art. 81.
6 E. 427 ; 9 R. 153.
SEC. 129. —District and parish courts have no jurisdic
tion, when actions are brought against persons residing in the
State, out of the limit of their respective jurisdiction, except
in the cases expressed in this code, unless the defendant, of
his own accord, should submit to their jurisdiction, as hereaf
ter provided.

SEC. 132.—Attorneys and advocates, when guilty of con
tempt of the courts, before which they plead, are subject to
punishment, pursuant to the provisions of special laws.
Stat. 20th March, 1839, p. 170.—§ 21. When a fine
shall be imposed by any court of justice, for the non-at
tendance of any witness, juror, or for any other cause, it shall
be the duty of the clerk of said court to issue within two ju
dicial days, a writ of fieri facias, at the suit of the State,
against the person or persons on whom said fine shall have
been imposed, and that the clerk and sheriff, or coroner and
marshal, as the case may be, shall be made responsible for
the faithful performance of the law contained in the above section ; provided, however, that such fines shall not be im
posed without a rule on the party to show cause unless
the circumstances of the case should in the discretion of the
court require no delay.
SEC. 133.—Courts of original jurisdiction may fine jury
men, sheriffs, constables, and the other officers attached to the
courts, when they fail to attend, or neglect their duty ; but
the fine cannot exceed fifteen dollars, for each offense of that
description.
SEC. 134. —Those courts may enforce the personal attend
ance of witnesses before them, by having them properly sum
moned for that purpose ; provided they reside in the parish
where the court is held.
SEC. 135.—If a witness, who has been duly summoned in
a suit, fail to appear personally, the court may order, at the
request of either of the parties, that he be brought by attach
ment before them ; and if he does not show good cause for
not having obeyed the summon, the court may fine him in a
sum not exceeding one hundred dollars.
No. 275, Stat. April 30th, 1853 —§ 1. Any witness who
may have been summoned to attend any of the courts of this
State to testify in a civil case, and shall have attended, claim
ed, and received a certificate therefore, shall not again be
compelled to obey any summons for attending said court in
said case at a subsequent term, until he be paid, or the money
tendered to him, upon demand by the said witness of the party
whom he was summoned, or in his absence, of his agent or
his attorney.
SEC. 136.—If a witness summoned in a cause, refuse to
answer any questions put to him, except such as might lead
him to accuse himself of some crime, the court may fine such
witness in a sum not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars,
and imprison him for a term not exceeding thirty days.
SEC. 137. —The party aggrieved by the refusal of a witness
to answer the questions put to him, has, besides, his action
of damage for the loss he may have sustained through his
refusal.
SEC. 138.—Courts may, at the request of the parties, ad
dress commissions to judges of other courts, justices of the
peace, or other persons, to take the deposition of witnesses or

of the parish where such courts are held ; and even of witness
es residing within the parish, when they are old and infirm, or
expected to leave the State. The formalities to be observed
in such cases are hereafter provided.
9 L. 242 ; 18 L. 59 ; See art. 439.
SEC. 139.—Courts may likewise, at the request of either
of the parties, order that the other shall bring into court the
object in dispute, of which he is in possession, if it be a slave,
or such movable property as can be produced, in order that
it may be shown by testimony, that it is in reality the object
claimed ; and if the party refuse to comply with the order,
that refusal shall be considered as full proof of the identity of
the object.
SEC. 140.—Courts may also at the request of one of the
parties, decree, that the other party bring into court the books,
papers, and other documents, which are in his possession, and
which are material in the cause, provided the party requesting
their production declares in writing, and on oath, what are the
facts he intends to establish by such books, papers, or other
documents ; and on the refusal of the party thus called upon
to comply with the order of the court, the facts stated and
sworn shall be considered as having been confessed, until
satisfactory evidence be shown of the impossibility of produc
ing such documenta

SEC. 141.—Courts may also, at the request of either of
the parties in a suit, order a third person, having in his pos

CHAPTER II
OF THE ORDINARY PROCEEDINGS.
SEC. 146.—The word proceeding, in its general accepta
tion, means, the form in which actions are to be brought and
defended, the manner of intervening in suits, of conducting
them ; the mode of deciding them, of opposing judgments,
and of executing them.
The forms are different, in ordinary, executory, and sum
mary proceedings.
SEC. 147.—A demand means a civil action brought before
a court of justice, to obtain a thing to which one thinks him
self entitled.
SEC. 148.—Separate actions may be cumulated in the
same demand, except in the cases hereafter expressed ; this is
termed cumulation of action.
SEC. 149. —The plaintifff is not allowed to cumulate seve
ral demands in the same action, when one of them is contrary
to, or precludes another.
As when one has bought a thing in the name of another,
and with his funds, without his authorization ; the person, for
whom the purchase has been made, cannot demand, by the
same action, both the thing bought in his name, and the
money employed for paying the price.
Nor can a vendor demand, at the same time, the rescission
of the sale he has made, and the price for which it was made ;
he must decide for one or the other of the two causes of ac
tion, as the one precludes the other.
1 N. S. 439; 2 N. S. 323; 6 N. S. 39; 1TS.S. 403; 8 ST. S. 334; 1 L. 139;
4 L. 353,360; 5 L. 440 ; 8 L. 267; 13 L. 582; 14 L. 279; 15 L. 78,199; 16 L. 384;
6 R. 520; 11 R. 87; 12 R. 188; 2 A. 158; 3 A. 366.
SEC. 150.—In possessory actions, one cannot claim, at
the same time, both the possession and the ownership, if the
two are demanded ; it shall be presumed that the posses
sory has been relinquished, in order to resort to the petitory
action.
16 L. 380.
SEC. 151.—If the plaintifff has several causes of action,
tending to the same conclusion, not contrary to, nor exclusive
of each other, though they arise from different contracts, he
may cumulate and bring them in the same suit, as, for exam
ple, if one claim from another one hundred dollars in virtue
of a sale, and one thousand dollars in virtue of a loan, or if
he claim a slave from another, both by inheritance and by
purchase.
6 N. S. 392; 8 N. S. 333,438; 1 L. 131 ; 5 L. 437 ; 8 L. 267.
SEC. 152. —When two causes of action, contrary to, and
exclusive of each other, have been cumulated in the same de
mand, the defendant may refuse to plead to the merits, until
the plaintifff have made his choice as to which of the two he
means to proceed with ; and if the exception be sustained by
the court, the plaintifff shall be bound to amend his petition,
so as to preserve only one cause of action, otherwise his suit
shall be dismissed with costs.
6 N. S. 392 ; 7 N. S. 403 ; 15 L. 195 ; 3 A. 365.
SEC. 153. —Demands are principal or incidental.
The principal demand is that by which the suit is com
menced in court ; and for this reason it is also termed ordi
nary demand.
An incidental demand is that which is made before issue
joined, in order to obtain something relating to the principal
object of the suit ; such are demands in warranty or in inter
vention.
17 L. 176; 6R. 466.
SEC. 154.—The principal demand must be brought before
the court which has the jurisdiction of the case.
The incidental demand must be decided at the same time
with the principal ; it is subject to the same jurisdiction as
the suit itself.
17 L. 176; 6 R. 466.
SEC. 155.—One should only demand in court what is
really due to him ; nevertheless, if one demand more, the ac
tion shall be sustained for the amount actually due, and the
defendant shall pay the costs, unless he prove, that previous to
the suit he made a real offer of the amount actually due to the
plaintifff, with the interest, and the cost which had accrued.
SEC. 156. —If one demand less than is due him, and do
not amend his petition, in order to augment his demand, he
shall lose the overplus.
14 L. 140 ; 2 R. 207 : Ante 91.
SEC. 157.—If, in an action of debt, the plaintifff fail to
claim the interest due to him, or to amend his petition in
order to include it, he cannot, after judgment, demand such
interest by another action ; he shall be considered as having
remitted it.
But as relates to the costs of the suit, it is not required
that they should have been claimed in the petition or answer,
in order to recover them ; they are due to him in favor of
whom the judgment has been rendered, even if nothing is said
on the' subject in the judgment.
17 L. 331 ; 1 R. 469 ; 12 R. 194 ; 6 A. 297.
SEC. 158.—When the demand is premature, that is to say,
when the action has been brought before the debt had become
due, the suit must be dismissed, leaving to the party his right
to bring his action in due time.
The same rule must be observed, if the object due be de
manded out of the place where it was to have been delivered,
or if the obligation be conditional, and its execution be de
manded before the condition has been fulfilled.
1 L. 504; 8 L. 589; 11 L. 420; 13 L. 403.
SEC. 159.—Judicial demands are either verbal or in writ
ing.
It is only before justices of the peace that demands may
be made verbally, as will be provided in the rules to be ob
served for proceeding before the tribunals of justices of the
peace.
All other demands brought before the courts, must be in
writing, and in the form of petition.
SEC. 160.—Though there be as many kinds of demands as
there are actions, those which must be made in writing are
subject to no distinct and peculiar form ; they are only sub
jected to a few general and common rules, hereafter pro
vided.
13 L. 416.
SEC. 161.—It is sufficient in all judicial demands, which
are required to be in writing, to express clearly what is de
manded, with such conclusions as may serve as a basis to the
judgment to be rendered in the cause.
Sec. II. —Before what tribunals actions are to be brought.
SEC. 162. —It is a general rule in civil matters, that one
must be sued before his own judge, that is to say, before the
judge having jurisdiction over the place where he has his domicil,
or residence ; but that rule is subject to several excep
tions.
8 N. S. 252 ; 2 L. 29, 224, 280 ; 3 L. 125 ; 8L. 213, 524 ; 9 L. 549 ; 11 L. 178 ; 14
L. 124 ; 3 R. 7, 26, 411 ; 6 R. 6, 466 ; 1 A. 78.
SEC. 163.—In actions of revendication of real property,
or when proceedings are instituted, in order to obtain the
seizure and the sale of real property, in virtue of an act of
hypothecation, importing confession of judgment, the defend
ant may be cited, whether in the first instance, or in appeal,
either within the jurisdiction where the property revendicated
or hypothecated is situated, though he has his domicil or resi
dence out of that jurisdiction, or in that where the defendant
has his domicil, as the plaintifff chooses.
2 N. S. 375 ; 3 N. S. 654; 4 N. S. 188 ; 2 L. 223 ; 4 L. 240 ; 6 R. 466 ; 9 R. 549 ;
11 R. 387 ; 3 A. 637.
SEC. 164. —In matters relative to successions, the defend
ants, though domiciliated elsewhere, must be cited to appear
before the court of the place where the succession has been
opened :
1. In all suits brought by the heirs against each other, un
til after partition, inclusively ;
2. In all suits brought by the creditors of the deceased,
previous to the partition ;
3. In all suits relating to the execution of testamentary
dispositions, until the final settlement of the affairs of the es
tate has been effected.
SEC. 165. There are other exceptions to this rule, which
require that the defendant be sued before the judge having ju
risdiction over the place of his domicil or residence ; they are
here enumerated :
1. In matters relative to the partition of real property be
tween several co-proprietors ; for in such a case the suit must
be brought before the court of the place where such property is
situated, though the co-proprietors may reside in different
parishes ;
2. In matters relative to partnership ; as long as the part
nership continues, in all suits concerning it, the parties must
be cited to appear before the tribunal of the place where it is
established, or if there are several establishments, before that
of the place where the obligation was entered into ;
3. In matters relative to failure, all the suits already com
menced, or which may be subsequently instituted against the
debtor, must be carried before the court in which the failure
has been declared ;
13 L. 423 ; 17 L. SI ; 2 R. 348; 9 R. 45
4. In matters relative to warranty, they must be carried
before the court having cognizance of the principal action in
which demands in warranty arise ;
5. In matters relative to judicial costs, or to the fees of
advocates, the suit instituted for their recovery must be
brought before the court where they have been incurred ;
6. When the defendants are foreigners, or have no fixed
or known place of residence in the State, they may be cited
wherever they are found.
Stat. 7<A April, 1826, p. 168.—§ 2. Number five of ar
ticle one hundred and sixty-five, be and the same is hereby
repealed, and that suits for the recovery of the debts therein
mentioned may be brought before any court of competent
jurisdiction.
4 R. 342.
SEC. 166.—If a defendant reside alternately in different
parishes, he must be cited in that in which he appears to
have his principal establishment, or his habitual residence.
If his residence in each appear to he nearly of the same
nature, in such a case he may be cited in either, at the choice
of the plaintifff, unless he has declared, pursuant to the provi
sion of the law, in which of those parishes he intended to
have his domicil.
9 R. 243; 1 A 78; 4 A. 553.
SEC. 167.—If the defendant change his domicil, he must
be cited in the parish where he has resided within the last
year, or within that where he has declared, in the manner pre
scribed by law, that he intended to have his domicil.
SEC. 168.—If the defendant has not made such a declara
tion, he may, nevertheless, be cited in the parish where he
lives, though he has not resided one whole year in it, if he has
done in that parish acts which manifest sufficiently that he
intended to make it the place of his domicil.
11 L. 179.
Sec. III.—Of Petition and Citation.
SEC. 169.—It is not necessary, previous to bringing a suit,
to make an amicable demand in writing.
Stat. 20th March, 1839, p. 162.—§ 1. When the defendant
resides out of the State, or when the suit is commenced by

called a judicial sequestration.
See amendment to art. 237 ; 10 R. 147.

compensation of that which the plaintifff claims, is of a less

a demand in reconvention, it is requisite that such demand.
though different from the main action, be, nevertheless, neces
sarily connected with, and incidental to the same ; as, for in
stance, the demand instituted by the possessor in good faith
against him who sues in order to evict him, or for the pur
pose of obtaining the payment of the improvements made on
the premises.
7. That article three hundred and seventy-five of said
code be so amended, that when the plaintifff resides out of the
State, or in the State, but in a different parish from the de
fendant, said defendant may institute a demand in reconven
tion against him for any cause, although such demand be not
necessarily connected with, or incidental to the main cause of
action.
See ante 374.
SEC. 376.—If the demand instituted by the defendants be
one, in its nature, independent from the action brought by
the plaintifff, it shall be considered as a principal, and not a
reconventional demand, and must be brought at the domicil
of the plaintifff.
SEC. 377. —In all cases of reconvention, the defendant
may plead it, either as an exception, in his answer to the prin
cipal demand, or institute a distinct and separate demand be
fore the court in which the main action is pending ; and the
original plaintifff shall be bound to answer, without pleading

Sec. III.—Of demands in warranty.
SEC. 378. —The obligation which one contracts to defend
another in some action which may be instituted against him,
is termed warranty. The one who has contracted this obli
gation is called the warrantor.

219, 254, 828 ; 6 A. 32.
SEC. 379.—Warranty may be of two kinds, real or per
sonal.
Real warranty is that which arises in real, or hypothecary
actions, as when a purchaser is sued in eviction of an immov
able property which has been sold to him.
Personal warranty is that vvhich takes place in personal ac
tions ; it arises from the obligation which one has contracted,
to pay the whole, or a part of a debt, due by another to a
third person.
8 R. 27.
SEC. 380. —When one is sued in eviction of an immovable
property sold to him, or for the payment of a debt which an
other had promised to pay on his account to the plaintifff, he
shall be entitled to a delay, in order to have his warrantor
made a party to the suit, as provided in the following ar
ticle.
7 N. S. 587.
SEC. 381. —The delay granted to call the warrantor, must
be the same as that given to such warrantor, to answer to the
demand instituted against him, according to the distance of
his domicil from the place where the court is held, in which
the main action is pending.
14 L. 497 ; 19 L. 473; 1 R. 133.
SEC. 382.—The defendant wishing to call one in warranty,
may, in his answer, pray the court to decree against his war
rantor the same judgment which may be rendered against him
on the principal action ; such prayer will be considered as a
demand in warranty.
SEC. 383.—The clerk of the court in which the defendant
has in his answer, called one in warranty, must make out a
copy of such answer, and issue a citation, both of which sball
be served on the warrantor, who shall be allowed for answer
ing, the same delay as in ordinary suits ; and he shall address
the same to the sheriff of the parish, in which the warrantor
resides, in order that it be notified to him, in the same manner
as is directed in ordinary suits.
SEC. 384. —The warrantor thus cited, is bound to appear
before the court in which the principal demand has been insti
tuted, even when he resides out of its jurisdiction, in order to
defend the suit for the defendant ; he may plead every excep
tion in defending the cause which the defendant himself might
have pleaded, even such as are personal to such defendant.
4 N. S. 393 ; 8 N. S. 156 ; 1 L. 38 ; 6 L. 350, 378 ; 8 L. 239, 252 ; 10 L. 271.
SEC. 385. —If the defendant is cast in the action, the
judge, when he gives judgment against such defendant, must
render, at the same time, a judgment in favor of the defend
ant against his warrantor, for whatever indemnity may be due
to such defendant, as well as for all the loss and damage he
may have sustained, by reason of the action.
No. 298. Stat. 30th April, 1853.—An act to amend tlie
three hundred and eighty-fifth article of the Code of Practice.
That article three hundred and eighty-five of the Code of Prac
tice he amended and re-enacted so as to read as follows : " If the
defendant is cast in the action, the judge, when he gives judg
ment against such defendant, must render at the same time a
judgment in favor of the defendant, against his warrantor, for
whatever indemnity may be due to such defendant, as well as for
all the loss and damage he may have sustained by reason of the
action. But no sheriff, constable, or other officer of court, shall
have the right to recover of any seizing creditor, sued as warran
tor, the counsel fees of such sheriff, constable or other officer, in
curred by calling such creditor in warranty, unless the latter
shall, within ten days only from service of the call in warranty,
fail to appear and make defense for the defendant who calls
him.
6 N. S. 117 ; 5 R. 76 ; 8 R. 488 ; 9 R. 50.
SEC. 386.—The judgment so rendered, shall be executory
on the part of the plaintifff against the defendant, and on the
part of the defendant against his warrantor.
8 R. 488.
SEC. 387. —If one called in warranty has himself a warran
tor who is bound to defend him, he may also in his answer,
pray that his warrantor be cited to appear to the suit ; he
shall be entitled, in order to do so, to the same delay granted
to the defendant for calling Ins warrantor ; the same rule shall
govern, if there be a greater number of warrantors. In such
cases, the proceedings shall be carried on, and the judgment ren
dered and executed in the manner provided in the preceding articles.
SEC. 388.—The defendant, though he has not called his
warrantor to defend the suit brought against him, does not lose
on that account, his action in warranty, unless the warrantor
prove that he had means for defeating the action, which were
not used, owing to the defendant having failed to call him in
warranty, or having neglected to apprise him of the suit hav
ing been brought.
Sec. IV.—Of Intervention or Interpleading.
SEC. 389. —An intervention or interpleader, is a demand
by which a third person requires to be permitted to become a
party in a suit between other persons ; either by joining the
plaintifff in claiming the same thing, or something connected
with it, or by uniting with the defendant in resisting the claims
of the plaintifff.

SEC. 390. —In order to be entitled to intervene, it is enough
to have an interest in the success of either of the parties to
the suit.
Stat. 7th April, 1836, p. 172.—§ 10. Articles three hun
dred and eighty-nine and three hundred and ninety, shall be
so amended, that it shall not be necessary that the party in
terpleading should join either the plaintifff or defendant, but
that it may be lawful for him, where his interest requires it, to
oppose both.
1 L. 431; 7L. 196; 4R. 290; 11 R. 326.
SEC. 391. —One may intervene, either before or after issue
has been joined in the cause ; provided the intervention do not
retard the principal suit : the person intervening must be
always ready to plead, or to exhibit his testimony ; because
he has always his remedy by a separate action to vindicate his
rights.
5N.S.501; 71J.S.587; 11R.326; 4A.206.
SEC. 392.—The plaintifff, in intervention, must institute
his demand before the court in which the principal action has
been brought ; being considered as plaintifff, he must follow
the jurisdiction of the defendant.
SEC. 393.—The intervention must be formed by a petition
addressed to the court, before which the principal demand has
been brought ; it must set forth the grounds on which the
cause is supported.
This petition must be served on the party against which it
is directed, in order that he may answer to the same in the
delay given in ordinary suits.
19 L. 154; 3 A. 366.
SEC. 394. —The judge cannot refuse to admit an inter
vention ; but he must pronounce on its merits, at the same
time that he decides the principal action ; if the demand be
not sustained, the person intervening shall be decreed to pay
the incidental costs.
3 A. 321, 366; 4 A. 212.
Sec. V.—Of the opposition of third persons.
SEC. 395.—This opposition is a demand brought by a
third person, not originally a party in the suit, for the purpose
of arresting the execution of an order of seizure, or judgment
rendered in such suit, or to regulate the effect of such seizure,
in what relates to him.
8 L. 495; 7 L. 486; 4 R. 39,466; 5 R. 68, 352, 496;6R.427; 8 R. 14; 9 R. 302;
1 A. 146, 330 ; 3 A. 454, 597.
SEC. 396. —Such opposition may take place in two cases :
1. When the third person making the opposition, pretends
to be the owner of the thing which has been seized ;
2. When he contends that he has a privilege on the pro
ceeds of the thing seized and sold.
5R.496; 10R.28; 11 R. 181; See notes to art. 395.
SEC. 397.—This opposition must be made before the court
which has granted the order of seizure, or the judgment in
virtue of which the provisional seizure has been effected.
10R.424; 11 R. 181; 12 R. 519; 8 A. 454; 19 L. 151 ; See notes to art. 395;
See also 4 N. S. 390; 7 N. S. tioy.
SEC. 398. —If the opposition has for its object to set aside
the order of seizure, as having been effected on property not
belonging to the party against whom the order was directed,
but owned on the contrary by the third person making the op
position, it must be done by means of a petition, which, to
gether with a citation, must be served on the party making
the seizure, as in ordinary suits : but such opposition shall be
considered as a separate demand, distinct from the suit in
which the order was granted.
3 L. 495 ; 1 R. 41 ; 8 R. 14 ; 10 R. 424 ; See art. 395.
SEC. 399. —The court may, nevertheless, at the request
of the third opponent, enjoin the sheriff not to proceed to the
sale of the property thus claimed : provided such third person
give security to the plaintifff, for such an amount as the court
shall determine, to be responsible for all damages which said
plaintifff may sustain, should the opposition be wrongfully
made.
4 A. 279; See art. 400.
SEC. 400. —If the third person, who has intervened in the
suit, has not injoined the sale of the property of which he
claims the ownership, or has failed to furnish the surety re
quired, his opposition shall not prevent the sheriff from sell
ing the property under seizure ; but, in such case, the sheriff
shall be personally responsible for all damages which said sale
may occasion to the intervening party ; and the sheriff shall
have his recourse against the party who has obtained the order
of seizure. If the opposition be sustained, the sale made by
the sheriff shall be null.
Sec art. 395.
SEC. 401. —If, on the contrary, the opposition be made on
the ground that the third opponent has a privilege which en titles him to be paid, in preference to the party making the
seizure, out of the proceeds of the sale of the property seized ;
as when there are several seizures or conflicting claims, on the
same property ; such opposition may be made by motion, of
which due notice must be given, both to the party who has
made the seizure, to the sheriff; and the court, without
requiring any security from the third opponent, shall direct
the sheriff to retain in his hands, subject to their further order,
the proceeds of the sale.

SEC. 402. —If the third person has, either a privilege of
a higher class than that of the party who has made the seiz
ure, or a special hypothecation duly registered, anterior to that
of such party ; in such case, the third opponent shall be paid
for the amount of his claim, together with the interest and
costs ; and the plaintifff in the cause shall be entitled only to
receive the surplus, if there be any.
5 A. 73« ; See also ante, art. 401.
SEC. 403.—If, on the contrary, the third person interven
ing has only a general or legal hypothecation on the property
seized, the plaintifff in the original suit shall be paid in pre
ference, if he prove that the defendant has other property of
sufficient value, to satisfy the claim of the third opponent :
in such case, the third person intervening shall be condemned
to pay the costs.
See art. 401.
CHAPTER IV.
Of the proceedings after issue joined, until judgment be given.
Sec. I.—Of real tender.
SEC. 404.—When the defendant confesses that he owes
the whole or a part, either of the debt, or of the property de
manded of him, and the plaintifff refuses to receive what such
defendant acknowledges that he owes him, such defendant
may make a real tender of the same to such plaintifff, either
after the issue has been joined, or even previous to any judicial
proceeding having been instituted against him.
SEC. 405.—It is necessary to distinguish such real tenders,
which are made for a debt for money due, from those which
have for their object, the obligation of delivering a thing cer
tain and specific, or a qantity of any particular thing, or im
movable property.
SEC. 406. —A real tender must be made in the place
agreed upon for the payment ; or if there be no special agree
ment as to the place of payment, it must be made either to
the creditor himself, or at his dwelling, or at the domicil
chosen for the execution of the agreement.
15 L. 483.
SEC. 407.—When the tender is for money due, it must
be made to the creditor himself, or at his actual or chosen do
micil, by the debtor, or by his agent, in the presence of two
witnesses residing in the place, by tendering to such creditor
the sum which is due to him, with the interest, and such
costs as he may have incurred, and exhibiting such sum to
him in the presence of such witnesses, in the current coin of
the United States.
The same formalities must be observed in making a tender
of any thing due, and consisting of things certain, which the
debtor can easily carry about him.
9 L. 11 ; 15 L. 206; 4 R. 144; 2 A. 441; 6 A. 13.
SEC. 408.—If the debt be for a specific thing, or for a
quantity of any kind of movable property, which cannot be
easily transported, or which are to be delivered at a place de
signated in the contract, or necessarily indicated by the nature
of the obligation, the debtor must give previous notice in writ
ing to the creditor, that on such a day and hour, he shall be
at the place where the things to be tendered are deposited, in
order there to make a delivery of the same to him.
11 R. 516 ; see 3 L. 385.
SEC. 409.—After such notice, the debtor or his agent
must, on the day and at the hour appointed, be present at
the place where the property to be delivered is deposited ; and
there, in the presence of two witnesses residing in the place,
make a real tender of the same to the creditor, by showing
them, if he be present, and designating them to him, and by
offering to deliver the same to him immediately.
11 R. 516.
SEC. 410.—If the object, on the part of the debtor, be
real property, a debt, or some other personal right which the
debtor has promised to sell, transfer, or convey, to the creditor,
such debtor must previously give written notice to the credi
tor, to be and appear, on a certain day, and at a fixed hour,
at the office of some public notary, or of some officer exercis
ing similar functions, or at such other place as he may desig
nate, in order there to receive the sale, cession, transfer or
conveyance, which he is ready to make to him, either of the
real estate, debt, or personal right which he had contracted to
transfer to such creditor.
When the debt to be transferred, consists in bank stock,
the tender of the same must be made at the bank whose stock
is to be transferred.
SEC. 411.—After due notice having been given, the debt
or must appear either in person, or by his agent, at the place
designated, pursuant to the provision of the preceding article,
and there, in the presence of two witnesses, residing m the
place, offer to the creditor, if he appear, to execute in his fa
vor, in due form, either the sale, conveyance, or transfer,
which he had contracted to execute.
SEC. 412.—If the creditor refuse to accept the real ten
der thus made to him, or do not attend, on the day, hour, and
at the place designated to him by the debtor, to receive the
delivery of the property contracted to be sold, conveyed, or
transferred as prescribed in the preceding articles, the debtor
will have the option either to retain such property, in his pos
session until the creditor demands the same, judicially, or to
deposit them at the charge and risk of such creditor.
11 R. 516; 2 A. 243.
SEC. 413.—If the debtor determine to deposit the pro
perty, it must be deposited, if it consists in specie, in some of
the banks of the State, or in some of their branches ; if in
goods, merchandise, or some other personal property, the same
must be deposited in some store, warehouse or other safe
place, for the account of the creditor. If the property con
sist in slaves, and the debtor apprehend their running away,
he may have them committed to jail, and employ them on
public works for the account of the creditor.
The debtor must apprise the creditor, by a written notice,
of his having placed the property in deposit, and of the man
ner of his having effected the same ; he shall be bound to give
to the preservation of the property deposited, the same atten
tion as he would give to that of his own property. The cred
itor shall be bound to reimburse all the expenses which he
shall incur, on account of the said deposit, if the tender is de
creed to have been properly made.
4R. 144; 11 R. 510; 2 A. 243.
SEC. 414. —After depositing the property as above pre
scribed, should it perish, be spoiled, or its value diminish,
without any fault on the part of the debtor, the loss shall be
on the account of the creditor, if the tender be adjudged
valid.
11 R. 516; 2 A 243.
SEC. 415.—If, on the trial of a cause, it appear, that pre
vious to the suit having been instituted, the defendant had
made a real tender, in the form above prescribed, of the sum
due, or of the property demanded, the plaintifff shall be de
creed to pay all the costs of the suit, and all the expenses in
curred for the preservation of the property, if the same has
been deposited, and shall recover only the sum or thing ten
dered to him, and such interest only as had accrued, previous
to bringing the action.
4 L. 94; 6 L. 19; 4 R. 144; 2 A. 243, 441, 496.
SEC. 416. —When the real tender has been made since
the institution of the suit by the plaintifff, though the proper
ty has been placed in deposit as above prescribed, the defend
ant shall nevertheless, although the tender be declared valid,
be condemned to pay the costs, and all the expenses which
have been incurred up to the date of such real tender ; and
the plaintifff shall be bound to pay only such costs as have
arisen since his refusal to accept such real tender.
2 A. 243.
SEC. 417. —Real tenders may be made at every stage of
the suit, previous to the definitive judgment.
2 A. 243.
SEC. 418. —All the other rules relative to real tender, pro
vided by the Civil Code, not re-enacted in this section, and
which are not contrary to the provisions above expressed, must
be observed ; but all the provisions of the other statutes relat
ing to the same subject, are hereby repealed.
2 A. 243.
Sec. II. —Of the amendments ichich may be made to the peti
tion, or to the answer, of the consolidation of causes, and of
commissions for examining zoitnesses.
SEC. 419. —After issue joined, the plaintifff may, with
the leave of the court, amend his original petition ; provided
the amendment does not alter the substance of his demand,
by making it different from the one originally brought.
See references to art. 421.
SEC. 420. —The defendant may also amend his answer,
subject to the same rules, and add to it new exceptions : pro
vided they be not of the dilatory kind. After answering on
the merits, dilatory exceptions shall not be raised by way of
amendment, unless with the consent of the plaintifff.
See references to art. 421.
SEC. 421. —When one of the parties has amended, either
his petition, or his answer, the other party has the right of
answering the amendment ; but it must be done immediately,
unless the amendment be of such a nature as to induce the
court to grant further time for answering the same.

other several suits, either as principal or incidental demands,
before the same tribunal, the court may, at the request of one
of the parties, order that the same be consolidated, if from
their nature they may be compensated, in order that they may
be all decided by one single judgment.
SEC. 423. —Consolidation of suits may be ordered, when
ever a demand in warranty has been instituted before the
same court, separately from the main action, provided the
two suits are ready for trial at the same time.
SEC. 424. —When either the plaintifff or the defendant
has witnesses whom he wishes to be heard in support of his
claims, he must cause the testimony of such witnesses to be
taken in writing, to be read in evidence on the trial of the
cause, pursuant to the rules of the respective courts.

which depends on the will of the parties without their being
obliged to make known their motives for so doing.
SEC. 503. —Challenges to the polls, the causes of which
the parties are bound to declare and prove, are those which
are founded :
L Upon the juryman's filling some public employment
which exempts him front serving in this capacity ;
2. Upon his not having the qualifications required by
law ;
3. Upon his being suspected of some partiality or favor
for one of the parties ;
4. Upon his having been convicted of some crime or mis
demeanor, which legally renders him incapable of acting as a
juryman.

tioned in the preceding article, are to be understood in the
sense, and under the modifications hereafter mentioned.

that he do not expose himself to injure his reputation, or ac
cuse himself of some crime or misdemeanor.
SEC. 510.—The judge shall pronounce upon the challen

by his decision, may, in like manner, take an exception to his
opinion.
SEC. 511.—Besides the challenges, the causes of which
the parties must declare and prove as above, the plaintifff and
defendant have each the right of challenging peremptorily four
jurymen.
SEC. 512.—When there are many plaintifffs or defendants
in a cause, the parties who are equally interested, will be
obliged to join, in order to enjoy the right of challenging which
has been mentioned in the preceding article, so that there may
be no more than four jurymen peremptorily challenged, on
each side.
SEC. 513.—If, on account of the challenges, absence, or
sickness of some of the jurymen, or of any other legal excuse,
the jury should not be complete, the court shall order the
sheriff to summon a certain number of persons present, having
the legal qualifications, in order to complete it.
Stat. 8th March, 1841, p. 56.—§ 1. To amend the 513th article of the Code of Practice. Hereafter the district judge
of the ninth judicial district court in cases where juries are

whatever, the regular panel of jurors may be exhausted, to
direct the clerk of the court, in open court, to put in a box to
be prepared for that purpose, the names of such a number of
persons having the qualifications to serve as jurors, as he may
think necessary, not to exceed one hundred, and to direct said
clerk in open court, to draw from the said box such a number
of names as he may deem necessary, not to exceed fifty, and
that the same course may be pursued during the same court,
as frequently as in the opinion of the said judge, it may be
necessary, and the said clerk shall, immediately after the said
drawing, hand to the sheriff or proper officer, a summons for
the said jurors, and the said sheriff or officer shall immedi
ately proceed to summon the said jurors, who are hereby re
quired to obey the said summons, under the penalties now
provided for the punishment of defaulting jurors.
SEC. 514.—As soon as a juryman shall have been accepted
by the parties, or the challenge made to him shall have been
overruled by the court, he shall take an oath, that he will
pronounce, in a just and impartial manner, and to the best of
his judgment, in the case of such a one against such a one,
(naming the title of the cause) which is about to be submit

sworn, the court shall name, from amongst them, a foreman,
who shall preside over them and sign the verdict which they

12 R. 102 ; 2 A. 1019.
SEC. 517.—If, when the judge shall have finished his
charge to the jury, one of the parties believes that the judge
has mistaken the law, which he has stated to the jury, or in
the application which he has made of it, he may require the
judge to give his opinion in writing, touching this matter, and
on his refusal, he may take an exception, in the manner and
form heretofore set forth.
4 L. 18 ; 8 L. 32, 138 ; 11 L. 309 ; 5 R. 213 ; 12 R. 162.
SEC. 518.—When the jury shall have retired into the room
designated for this purpose, they shall deliberate under the
direction of their foreman, upon their verdict, and as soon as

hereafter mentioned, and give notice to the court, if it be still
in session, that the jury are ready to give their verdict.
5 N. S. 267 ; 9 L. 410 ; post, 522, 526, 527.

A general verdict is that by which the jury pronounce at the
same time on the fact and the law, either in favor of plaintifff
or defendant.

the facts only, leaving to the court the right of giving judg
ment on these facts and the law applicable to them.

SEC. 520. —The jury is always at liberty to give a general
verdict, by pronouncing on the law and on the fact, in the case
submitted to them.
Therefore, the law permitting cither party to submit, spe
cially, the facts in the case, to the jury, and so depriving them
of the right of giving a general verdict in the suit, is abro
gated.
8 lu 33; 10 L. 81 ; 12 R. 162.
SEC. 521. —But, should the jury think proper to render a
special verdict on the facts of the cause, those facts which the
jury shall have found, shall be considered as true, and the
judge shall render judgment accordingly, saving the right of
granting a new trial, if he believe that the jury have given
their verdict contrary to the evidence.
5 R. 78.
SEC. 522—The form of a general verdict consists in the
foreman indorsing on the back of the petition, these words,

the verdict is for plaintifff 01 defendant.
Ante, 518 ; 13 L. 109 ; 14 L. 3-JH ; 9 R. 59.
SEC. 523.—The jury has nothing to do with the costs in
a general verdict, inasmuch as it is entirely reserved for the

must write on the petition, or on a separate sheet of paper,
and successively, the different facts which they find in the

intelligible voice.
SEC. 527. —After the reading of the verdict, he shall ask
the jury if the verdict has been agreed to, and if the foreman
answer affirmatively, he shall enter the verdict on the records
of the court, unless one of the parties require that the jurors
be called, and each of them asked if he has agreed to the ver
dict, and if it appear that all the jurors have agreed to the
verdict, the same shall be recorded.
SEC. 528. —If, on reading the verdict, it appear that there
is some want of form as to the manner in which it has been
drawn, it may be corrected at the request of either of the
parties, under the direction of the court, either in their pre
sence, or after the jury shall have retired for that purpose, in
which case it shall again be brought into court after having
been corrected, in order to be read and recorded, as above di

at the reading of their verdict.
1 N. S. 225; 8 N. S. 274.
SEC. 530. —If, pending the adjournment, some member of
the jury have fallen sick, so as to be unable to be present in
court when the verdict is read, the court may commission a
justice of the peace to take the declaration on oath, of such
juror as to the manner in which he voted, at the time the
verdict was agreed to, unless the parties agree to dispense
with his declaration.
SEC. 531.—If a juror die during the adjournment, the
court shall examine, on oath, either the foreman or any other
member of the jury, in order to ascertain the manner in which

declaration of the deceased would have had, were he alive.
SEC. 532.^—The plaintifff, until the moment when the jury

withdraw, before discontinuing his suit, the verdict shall be
binding on him.

fault, or after hearing the parties.
6 N. S. 514; 8R. 254.

the demand of one only of the parties to the suit, whether he

8 R. 254.
SEC. 536.—If after the cause has been set down on the
docket for trial, the plaintifff does not appear either in person
or by attorney, to plead his cause, on the day fixed for trial,
the defendant may require that judgment of nonsuit be ren

SEC. 537. —Another distinction of judgments is into inter
locutory and final.
SEC. 538. —Interlocutory judgments do not decide on the
merits, they are pronounced on preliminary matters, in the
course of the proceedings.
SEC. 539.—Definitive or final judgments are such as de
cide all the points in controversy between the parties.
Definitive judgments are such as have the force of res ju

SEC. 540. —Courts give mandates or orders, which, though
they are not termed judgments, have, nevertheless, the same
effect as judgments ; such are mandates of arrest, and of
seizure.
SEC. 541.—When a cause has been tried by a jury, and
such jury have given a general verdict, the court must give
judgment pursuant to the same, within three days from the
time when such verdict has been entered on the records, unless

whether three judicial days shall have elapsed or not : Provid
ed, that this amendment does not apply to the parish of Or
leans.
SEC. 547. —Judgments may be amended by the court un
til after having been signed, in order,
1. To alter the phraseology of the judgment but not its
substance ;
2. To correct errors of calculation, as for instance, if more
have been given than was demanded, or if the party in favor
of whom the judgment was given, had been ordered to pay the
costs.
Except in the cases above provided, courts cannot alter
their judgments ; but they may, ex officio, direct a new trial
in order to revise their judgments.
6 L. 69; 7 R. 451.

rendered.
SEC. 635.—If the party, who has been condemned to de
liver a slave or other object, conceals it, or carries it out of the

paid to him, when the judgment of the court shall have been
complied with, and he shall have been paid the expenses and
damages which may be allowed to him, as provided in the fol
lowing article.

writs of possession and order of distringas, which were directed

debtor.

SEC. 705.—If the sale has been made on a credit, either
for the whole or a part, and payable in notes, by virtue of a
permission to that effect, granted by the parties, the sheriff
shall take from the purchaser separate notes for the portions
respectively coming to them, and shall deliver the notes in the
same manner as when the sale is made for ready money.
6 N. S. 472; see 681.
SEC. 706. —But when the property sold is subject to privi
leges or special mortgages in favor of other persons besides the
suing creditor, the sheriff shall require from the purchaser, and
he shall be compelled to deliver to the creditor, whether the sale
be made for ready money, or on credit, only the surplus of price,
beyond the amount of the privileges or special mortgages, if
there be any surplus.
5 R. 272 ; 6 R. 407.
SEC. 707.—On the other hand, if the suing creditor him
self has a privilege or special mortgage which is preferable or
anterior to other mortgages existing on the property sold, the
sheriff shall require of the purchaser, the payment of the price,
to the amount of the privilege or special mortgage of the seiz
ing creditor, and the purchaser shall apply the surplus of the
price, if there be any, to paying the special mortgages existing
on the property, subsequent to that of the suing creditor.
5 R. 272 ; 6 B. 407 ; 7 R. 398 ; 8 R. 175.
SEC. 708.—The purchaser is bound for nothing beyond the
price of his adjudication, and if, after paying the suing creditor,
as directed in the preceding article, there remains nothing
more due, to discharge the mortgages subsequent to that of the
suing creditor, the sheriff shall give him a release from these
mortgages.

SEC. 709. —The hypothecary action lies against the pur
chaser of a property seized, which is subject to privileges or
mortgages in favor of such creditors as have said privileges and
mortgages, in the same manner and under the same rules and
restrictions as are applicable to a third possessor of a mortgaged
property.
3 R. 160; 3 A. 542.
i
SEC. 710.—If there exist a general mortgage on the pro
perty, resulting either from a legal or judicial mortgage, the"
purchaser cannot avail himself of this, mortgage, although it be
duly recorded, to retain part of the price for the purpose of pay
ing it, or to refuse paying the price, if that has not been already
done, unless there has been a suit commenced against him, in
virtue of this general mortgage, to make him quit the property,
or unless he has just reason to fear that such a step will be taken
in which case he may retain the price, unless the suing credi
tor shall relieve him from this disturbance, or give him proper,
security against it.

398 , 8 R. 175 ; 9 R. 414 ; 1 A. 219 ; 2 A. 384 ; 5 A. 736.
SEC. 711.—However, if the purchaser has been evicted from
the thing adjudged to him, on the ground that it belongs to
another person than the party in whose hands it was taken, he
shall in that case, have his recourse for reimbursement against
*
the seized debtor and the seizing creditor ; hut upon the judg
ment obtained jointly for that purpose, the purchaser shall first
take execution against the debtor, and upon the return of such
execution, no property found, then he shall be at liberty to take
out execution against the creditor.
5 N. S. 81 ; 6L. 737 ; 5 R. 247 ; 9 R. 206; 10 R. 65 ; 11 R. 522; 2 A. 479.
Akt. 712. —The suing creditor shall be allowed his action
against the party in execution, for the reimbursement of what
ever he shall have been thus obliged to pay to the purchaser,
upon the return of the execution, no property found belonging
to the debtor.
SEC. 713. —On the other hand, if the purchaser is obliged
to quit the property sold to him, on the hypothecary action of
the creditor who had a legal or judicial mortgage, on all the
property of the party in execution, or if he has paid the amount
of such mortgage to avoid being dispossessed, he shall only
have recourse to the party in execution, and not to the suing
creditor.
3 R. 5; 5 R. 496; 11 R. 522.
SEC. 714. —rThe purchaser shall even lose the redress grant
ed by the two preceding articles, if an action is instituted against

provided this party possessed the means of repelling the de
mand, if informed of its having been made.
5 R. 496.
SEC. 715.—The purchaser against whom a suit is com
menced by a creditor having a legal and judicial mortgage on
the property of the debtor sued, may require the creditor to
discuss the other property which the debtor has in his posses
sion, and even that which he has alienated since the purchase,
because the creditor who has a general mortgage can only act
against the property of which his debtor has disposed, in the
order in which alienations have been made, beginning at the
most recent, and ascending to the most ancient.
SEC. 716.—When the sale has been made on twelve
months' credit, by reason of the property not having been bid
for at two-thirds of the appraisement, if the whole price be
coming to the judgment creditor, including interest and costs,
as provided for in the preceding paragraph, the sheriff shall re
quire from the purchaser his bond with security, for the bene

security, refuse or neglect to pay it when due, together with
the interest, the clerk who first issued the order of seizure,
shall, on the demand of the judgment creditor, or any other

sue an execution for the amount, both against the purchaser
and his surety, in the same manner as on a final judgment ;

SEC. 720.—If the amount of the bond, with interest and
costs, be not paid to him on demand, it is the duty of the
sheriff, under this execution, to seize immediately the property
of the purchaser, or of the surety, or of both, to the amount

the advertisements directed above, but with the modifications
contained in the following article.
Stat. 7th April, 1826, p. 174.—§ 14. The following words

cution according to the provisions of article seven hundred and
twenty, to indorse thereon, that the same issued on a twelve

same, shall be sold for whatever it will bring in cash, and it
shall be the duty of the sheriff to execute the same by seizing
the property of the principal or security, or both, and to sell
the same for whatever it will bring in cash after making the
advertisements required by law.
7 N. S. 194; 4 R. 181 ; 2 A. 230.
SEC. 721.—Property seized on execution issued on a
twelve months' bond, shall not be sold for less than one-half
of its appraised value ; the* appraisement to be made in the
manner prescribed for appraisements on the primary seizure.
See ante, 720, and 682 ; where the acts repealing this article will be found.
SEC. 722.—The creditor, by the mere act of seizure, is in
vested with a privilege on the movable and immovable pro
perty thus seized, which entitles him to a preference over other
creditors, unless the debtor has become bankrupt, previous to
the seizure.

40, 436.
SEC. 723.—When several successive seizures are made of
the same property, the creditors making them are entitled to
a preference over other ordinary creditors, according to the or
der of their seizures.
SEC.724. —Provisional seizures and sequestrations give no
privilege to those who have made them, until they have ob
tained a judgment and order of execution on the property se
questered or provisionally seized.
3 L. 183 ; 4 L. 224 ; 8 L. 42 ; 6 A. 444 ; see 275, 289.
SEC. 725.—But the provisional seizure in executory pro
ceedings and in actions in rem, gives the same privilege as the
seizure in execution.
See 292.
Sec. IV. —Of Imprisonments on Judgment.
SEC. 726.—When the sheriff to whom an execution is di
rected, can find no property to seize, he may call upon the
party against whom the execution is awarded, to point out to
him property which he may possess in the parish.
10 R. 136 ; 2 A. 407.
SEC. 727. —If, on this application, the debtor shows him
no property, and the judgment creditor is unable to point out
any, the sheriff shall return the execution into court, after in
dorsing on it a report signed by him, in which he shall declare
that he has found no property to seize, notwithstanding the
demand made of the parties.
4 L. 301 ; 6 L. 63 ; 10 R. 136 ; 2 A. 407.
SEC. 728. —If, after this report, the judgment creditor dis
covers any property belonging to his debtor, he may obtain a
new execution, to be carried into effect in the same manner as
the one first issued.
SEC. 729.—If, on the contrary, the judgment creditor can
find no property belonging to his debtor, he may demand of
the clerk, and it shall be the duty of that officer to deliver to
him an order to imprison the body of the debtor (a capias ad
satisfaciendum) until he shall have made a cession of property
to his creditors, and have obtained a discharge in conformity
to the provisions of an act entitled " an act for the relief of
insolvent debtors who are in confinement, &c."
Stat. 28th March, 1840, p. 131.—§ 1. The writ of capias
ad satisfaciendum be and the same is hereby abolished.

against the security on such obligation, on the return of " no
property found" on the writ of fieri facias, on giving ten days
notice to such security as provided for by law.
4. No debtor shall hereafter be held in imprisonment
under a writ of arrest, for a term exceeding three months, pro
vided that if the debtor reside within the State of Louisiana, he
shall at the expiration of such time, if so required by the com
plaining creditor, be ordered by the court to surrender his
property to his creditors ; which order shall be rendered on the
petition of such creditor, setting forth the facts and stating
under oath that he has reason to believe that such debtor is
possessed of property or assets which may be made available
to his creditors ; and such debtor shall not be discharged from
imprisonment until he shall have filed in the court from which
the order of arrest issued a schedule of his affairs and surren
dered his property to his creditors ; that said schedule shall
be made and all the proceedings in such surrender shall be
had and conducted in conformity with the provisions of the
act entitled " an act for the relief of insolvent debtors in actual
custody, and for establishing prison bounds for the public jail
and for other purposes" approved March twenty-fifth, eighteen
hundred and eight, and of the act amendatory of and supple
mentary to said act, and the provisions of this section shall
apply to debtors now in imprisonment under writs of arrrest.
5. Whenever two or more final judgments, each for a sum
exceeding three hundred dollars, shall have been rendered
against a debtor and execution issued thereon and returned
" no property found," and the plaintifffs shall unite in a petition
setting forth under oath that they have reason to believe that
the defendant has property, rights or assets of some descrip
tion within the State of Louisiana which may be made avail
able to his creditors, the court shall order such defendant to
show cause within ten days why he should not pay the amount
of such judgment, or in default of such payment, why he
should not make a surrender of his property to his creditors,
and in case said judgments are not satisfied on or before the
return day of said order to show cause, the court may if
satisfied with the showing, render judgment on said petition,
ordering; the defendant to file in court within a reasonable
time to be fixed by the court, a schedule of his affairs and to
surrender his property to his creditors ; which schedule shall
in all things be made conformably to the laws now in force
relative to the voluntary surrender of property, and all the pro
ceedings had in such matter shall be conducted as provided for
by said laws ; provided that if such judgments shall have been
rendered by the city court of New Orleans, the judgment
creditors shall address their petition either to the parish, dis
trict, or commercial courts.
6. In case such debtor shall fail or refuse to comply
with the judgment of the court, ordering surrender within
the delay fixed, the court shall on motion order such debtor
to prison there to remain until he shall have complied with
such judgment.
7. In case any debtor who shall have surrendered his
property under this, or any other act shall be convicted of
fraud, he shall be sentenced by the coHrt to suffer imprison
ment for a term not exceeding three years.
8. All debtors now in actual custody, shall be discharged
therefrom on the tenth May, eighteen hundred and forty ; pro
vided that there be no charge of fraud pending and undecided
against them ; provided further that when a debtor has not
been convicted of fraud, a charge of fraud may still be made
against him.
9. No citizen of another State shall hereafter be arrested
in this State, at the suit of a non-resident creditor, except in
cases where it shall be made to appear that the debtor has ab
sconded from his residence.
10. If a debtor who has not voluntarily surrendered his
property to his creditors or has not been proceeded against for
a surrender under the provisions of this act shall, in violation
of any existing law, have within the year, given an unjust ad
vantage or preference to any one or more of his creditors, by
payment or otherwise, or shall have anticipated the payment,
or provided for the payment of a debt not due, the effect
whereof shall be to injure the complaining creditor ; or shall
purchase property for cash, the delivery whereof shall be made
to him, and then shall sell or dispose of the same without pay
ing his vendor, or shall remove the same beyond the reach of
such vendor, or shall conceal or cover the same in any man
ner so that his vendor cannot render the same liable, (or shall
fail to pay over money received or collected for, or deposited
with him for another,) or shall have made a conveyance, or
transfer, or mortgages, or pledge of his property to the preju
dice of the complaing creditor ; any of such facts shall be held
presumptive evidence of fraud, liable, however, like all other
presumptions, to be disproved.
11. Any creditor who under the tenth section of this act
may justly believe that he has good cause of complaint, may
apply to a competent judge, who may thereupon order the ar
rest and confinement of the party complained of, until such
party shall give bond in a sum to be fixed by the judge, with
one or more solvent sureties residing in the State, conditioned
for such party's appearance to answer the petition and abide
the final order of the court thereon.
12. All cases which shall originate under the provisions
of this act, shall be tried within the shortest delay and in pre
ference to all other cases on the docket ; not, however, deny
ing to either party sufficient time to procure witnesses and
evidence upon a proper showing ; and either party may require
the same to be tried by jury.
13. When the causes mentioned in the tenth or eleventh
Bections of this act shall be tried, if the jury or court, as the
case may be, shall be satisfied that the defendant has been
guilty of defrauding the complaining creditor, the court shall
condemn the defendant to be imprisoned for a period not ex
ceeding three years ; and if it shall appear that the defendant
has only been guilty of conferring an unjust preference or ad
vantage upon another bona fide creditor, whose demand was
actually due, such defendant may be relieved from the im
prisonment by paying the complaining creditor, or repairing
the injury or fraud complained of ; and in case the jury or
court, as the case may be, shall find the charges against the
debtor unfounded, and that the creditor has proceeded without
reasonable ground of suspicion, they may impose such damages
against the party complaining as may be reasonable and just.
14. The creditor who may proceed against his debtor
under the provision of the tenth or eleventh sections of this
act may in the same action proceed against the party in favor
of whom the defendant may have made the sale, conveyance,
mortgage, transfer, pledge, assignment or payment complained
of and the court may render judgment against such third
party in pursuance of the existing laws.
15. The debtors complained of, shall not by the provisions
of this act, be denied or deprived of the benefit of the writ of
habeas corpus.
Stat. 10th February, 1841, p. 17.—§ 14. Whenever a judg
ment is rendered against a sheriff or other public officer, for
money by him or them received, in his or their official capacity,
and converted to his or their own use, or not accounted for,
and the writ of fieri facias is returned " no property found,"
a capias ad satisfaciendum may be taken out and executed
against such defendant or defendants.
Stat. 10th February, 1841. p. 18.—§ 19. Nothing contained
in the act entitled " an act to abolish imprisonment for debt,
approved twenty-eighth March, eighteen hundred and forty,"
shall be construed in any manner to impair the remedy of
creditors on bail bonds, executed prior to the passage of said
act ; and that lor the purpose of fixing the security on said
bonds, the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum shall remain in
force ; provided, that a debtor arrested under such writ, shall
be entitled to be discharged on complying with the provisions
of said act.
SEC. 730.—This order shall be directed to the sheriff of
the parish in which the debtor resides, who shall execute it,
by confining the body of the debtor, unless he pays the amount
of the judgment, with interest and costs, unless he takes the
prison limits.
SEC. 731.—If a debtor against whom a warrant of impris
onment has been rendered, shall fly into another parish, to
avoid being imprisoned, "he may be arrested by the sheriff or
any constable bearing the order, in the parish where he shall
be found, provided that the officer shall cause to be indorsed
on the warrant, an authorization to that effect, by the judge
or any justice of the peace of the parish or district in which it
is to be executed.
CHAPTER VII.
Of Executory Process.
SEC. 732.—Executory process can only be resorted to in
the following cases :
1. When the creditor's right arises from an act importing
a confession of judgment, and which contains a privilege or
mortgage in his favor ; ,
2. When the creditor demands the execution of a judg
ment which has been rendered by a tribunal different from that
within whose jurisdiction the execution is sought.
The proceeding by provisional seizure, (attachment,) or in
rem, resembles in some sort the executory process, but should
not be confounded with it, as they are subject to different
rules.
SEC. 733. —An act is said to import a confession of judg
ment, in matters of privilege and mortgage, when it is passed
before a notary public, or other officer fulfilling the same func
tions, in the presence of two witnesses, and the debtor has de
clared or acknowledged the debt for which he gives the privi
lege or mortgage.
12 L. 476 ; 4 11. 328; 5 R. 27; 6 R. 26; 10 R. 180; 3 A. 150; see 7 M. 239.
SEC. 734.—When the creditor is in possession of such an
act, he may proceed against the debtor or his heirs, by caus
ing the property subject to the privilege or mortgage to be
seized and sold, on a simple petition, and without a previous
citation of the debtor, in the manner laid down in the third
paragraph, second section, third chapter of the first part of
this code.

to 67, 744.
SEC. 735.—In obtaining this order of seizure, it shall suf
fice to give three days' notice to the debtor, counting from that
on which the notice is given, if he resides on the spot, adding
a day for every twenty miles between the place of his residence,
and the residence of the judge to whom the petition has been
presented.
7 N. S. 516; 4 L. 308; 6 R. 192, 463 ; 9 R. 8 ; 2 A. 145 ; 3 A. 268; see 163.
SEC. 736.—The judge within whose jurisdiction is situated
the property subjected to the privilege or mortgage, has the
power to issue this order of seizure and sale, although the
debtor resides out of his jurisdiction ; and in this case, the
clerk of the court issuing the order shall direct to the sheriff
of the parish where the debtor resides, a written notice to be
given to him, and it shall be the duty of the said sheriff to
serve the notice, and return the original with his report in the
same manner as in ordinary citations.
2 A. 145.
SEC. 737.—If the debtor who has granted the privilege or
mortgage is absent, and not represented in the State, the judge,
at the request of the plaintifff, shall appoint him an attorney,
to whom notice of the demand shall be given, in the manner
above directed, and contrarily with whom the seizure and sale
shall he prosecuted.
8 N. S. 584; 3 L. 444 ; 7 L. 66 ; see 748, 749.
SEC. 738.—The debtor, against whom this order of seizure
shall have been rendered, may obtain an injunction to suspend
the sale, if before the time of sale, he files in the court issuing
the order, his opposition in writing, alleging some of the rea
sons contained in the following article, and of which he shall
swear to the truth.
2 E. 90 ; 4 R. 490.
SEC. 739.—The debtor can only arrest the sale of the
thing thus seized, by alleging some of the following reasons to
wit :
1. That he has paid the debt for which he is sued ;
2. That it has been remitted by the creditor ;
3. That it has been extinguished by transaction, novation,
or in some other legal manner ;
4. That time has been granted to him for paying the debt,
although this circumstance be not mentioned in the contract ;
5. That the act containing the privilege or mortgage, is
forged ;
6. That it was obtained by fraud, violence, fear, or some
other unlawful means ;
7. That he has a liquidated account to plead in compensa
tion of the debt claimed ;
8. And finally, that the action for the recovery of the debt
is barred by prescription.
15 L. 431 ; 3 R. 345 ; 4 R.^27, 95, 490 ; 10 R. 68 ; 5 1 634.
SEC. 740. —When the judge grants an injunction, on the
allegation under oath, of any of the reasons mentioned in the
preceding article, he shall require no surety from the defendant,
but he shall pronounce summarily on the merits of his opposi
tion, if the plaintifff requires it, as is explained below.
SEC. 741.—The plaintifff against whom the injunction has
been obtained, may compel the defendant to prove, in a sum
mary manner, before the judge, the truth of the facts alleged
in his opposition.
2 L. 321, 482 ; 4 L. 90 ; 4 R. 59 ; 6 A. 634 ; see 756.
SEC. 742.—If, on being thus required, the defendant proves
that the action on which the seizure has been obtained is ex
tinct or prescribed, or that the cause of it is void, or that the
debt on which it is founded is paid, remitted, or compensated,
the judge shall revoke the order of seizure, and condemn the
plaintifff to pay costs.
SEC. 743.—But if the defendant does not prove the truth
of the facts alleged in his opposition, or if it appears that he
has paid or can plead in compensation, for only a part of the
debt, the judge shall dissolve the injunction he had granted,
and the sale of the property shall proceed, either for the whole
debt or for a part, as the case may be.
2 A. 763.
SEC. 744.—The executory process in matters of privilege
and mortgage, may be pursued, not only against the debtor,
or his heirs, but also against the third possessors of the things
subjected to it, according to the forms prescribed in the 3d
paragraph, 2d section, 3d chapter of the 1st part of this code.
3L.319; 1 A. 204; see 61, 68.
SEC. 745.—When the sheriff sells property which he has
seized conformably to the provisions contained in this chapter,
he must cause the same appraisements to be made, and ob
serve the same delays and formalities as are prescribed for the
sale of property seized in execution.
8 L. 581 ; 9 E. 8 ; 5 A. 737 ; see 654, 664.
SEC. 746.—When a creditor has obtained against his debt
or a judgment having the force of res judicata, in*a tribunal
different from that in which he seeks the execution, whether
the judgment was rendered in this State or another State of the
Union, or iii a foreign country, he may, on this ground, pro
ceed by executory process, and cause to be seized and sold the
property of his debtor, without previous citation, in the same
manner as on privileged or mortgaged debts, contained in acts
importing confession of judgment, except in the case mention
ed in the following article.
3 L. 475 ; 8 L. 581 ; 10 L. 222, 381 ; 12 L. 44, 46 ; 3 R. 94 ; 4 R. 274; 9 R
267 ; 2 A. 212 ; 3 A. 253, 693, 698 ; see 747.
SEC. 747.—If the judgment of which the creditor is in pos
session, shall appear to have been rendered by default, or on
attachment, in other tribunals than those of this State, he
cannot proceed by the executory process under the pretext
that the judgment has acquired the force of res judicata, but
must adopt the ordinary mode.
Stat. 1st June, 1846, p. 166.—So much of articles seven
hundred and forty-six and seven hundred and forty-seven of
the Code of Practice as authorizes a creditor having obtained
a judgment in another State of the Union, or in a foreign
country, to proceed by executory process on said judgment be,
and the same is hereby repealed.
1 L. 207 ; 8 L. 294; 6 R. 29 ; 9 R. 267 ; 2 A. 212; 3 A. 693, 698.
SEC. 748.—The defendant, against whom an order of
seizure has been obtained, by virtue of a judgment, as stated
above, may obtain an injunction to stop the sale of the proper
ty seized, if he alleges under oath, in his opposition, that the
judgment has not acquired the force of res judicata, because
he has appealed from it, or because it is void by the law of the
place where it was rendered.
4 R. 274 ; 2 A. 212; see 304.
SEC. 749.—The defendant may also obtain an injunction,
on alleging, under oath, any of the causes which prevent the

court that the sheriff has neglected or refused to pay over any
funds, or deliver any bonds or obligations in his possession to
the party entitled to the same, without any legal cause or rea
sonable excuse, the judgment of the court on said case shall be
certified to the governor of the State of Louisiana, whose duty
it shall be forthwith to remove such sheriff from office, and to
appoint another sheriff in his place : and if said appointment
should take place during the recess of the legislature, the com
mission of such sheriff shall expire in the same manner as other
appointments by the governor during the recess.
Stat. 10th February, 1841, p. 17—§ 14. Whenever a

the manner required by law, to bring parties into court, and
the legal delay for considering or opposing such accounts shall
have elapsed.
4. No account as aforesaid shall be homologated and ap
proved until the heirs or their representatives, or the parties
interested therein, who reside out of the parish in which the
court, having jurisdiction of the matter, is held, shall have
been notified for at least thirty days, which notice shall be
given by advertisement in the same manner, as an advertise
ment of sheriff sales are made in said parish, and shall have
the same effect as a citation regularly issued and served ; nor
until the legal delay for considering and opposing such accounts
shall have elapsed : Provided, that neither advertisement nor
citation shall he necessary in any case when the heirs or their
legal representatives, or other persons interested, consent to the
homologation of said accounts.
5. Whenever opposition is made and filed to the homo

\
CHAPTER X.
Of Order8 which Courts of Justice may render in certain
Cases.
SEC. 786. —Besides the powers which are granted to courts
of justice, according to the provisions above mentioned, there
are others conferred on them in certain cases, which are exer
cised in a summary manner, without going through the ordinary
forms of action.
It is of these powers and the manner of their exercise that
we shall treat in the present chapter.
SEC. 787. —The first of these powers is that of issuing the
writ of habeas corpus, that privilege granted to all free persons
of being released from illegal arrest or detention.
SEC. 788. —The other extraordinary powers belonging to
courts of justice, may be divided into two species, which are
enumerated in the two following articles.
SEC. 789.—Courts of justice may, in certain cases hereaf
ter provided, direct orders to individuals or corporations to com
pel them to perform certain duties prescribed for them by the
law, or to prevent them from usurping powers which do not
belong to them.
1 A. 162; see 2 L. 89.
SEC. 790.—Courts of appeal have the right to issue orders
to inferior judges :
1. To compel them to render justice to parties, or to per
form certain duties belonging to their office, or to prevent
them from usurping an authority which does not belong to
them ;
2. To oblige them to send up a copy of their proceedings,
that the validity of them may be examined, when they are ac
cused of having violated any of the forms of law.
Sec. I. —Of the writ of Habeas Corpus.
SEC. 791.—The habeas corpus is an order in writing, issued
in the name of the State, by a judge of competent jurisdiction,
and directed to a person who has another in his custody, or
detains him in confinement, commanding him to bring before
the judge the person thus detained, at the time and place ap
pointed, and to state the reasons for which he thus keeps him
imprisoned and deprived of liberty.
6 L. 436.
SEC. 792.—The district judges and the judge of the crimi
nal court of New Orleans, and the courts established or to be
established, whose jurisdiction exceeds three hundred dollars,
shall alone have the right of granting writs of habeas corpus
within the limits of their respective jurisdictions, except in the
case provided by the following article.
Const. 1845, art. 62. Const. 1852, art. 61, 69.
Stat. 16th March, 1828, p. 156, 416.—Without altering in
any manner the powers by which the judge of the parish of
Orleans is authorized by the Code of Practice to issue writs of
habeas corpus and other extraordinary process, it shall be law
ful for the other parish judges of this State to issue writs of
mandamus, certiorari and prohibition, directed to the justices
of the peace under their jurisdiction to compel the said justices
to comply with the duties which are imposed on them by law,
or to prevent them from exceeding the limits of their jurisdic
tion ; and that the said parish judges may issue writs of habeas
corpus in all cases not capital.
SEC. 793. —When the judge of any district is absent, in
terested, or prevented by any cause whatever, from acting in
that quality, and there is no criminal court, or court of con
current jurisdiction in the district, the habeas corpus may be
issued by any judge of competent jurisdiction, in one of the
adjoining districts. But in this case, the absence, interest or
disability of the judge of the district where the imprisonment
exists, shall be made to appear by the oath of the petitioner,
or other sufficient proof.
SEC. 794.—The habeas corpus may be obtained on a peti
tion being addressed to a judge who has the power of granting
it. It must be signed by the party, or some other person in
his name, mentioning, in the latter case, the name of the party
confined.
SEC. 795. —This petition shall state in substance, that the
party applying is imprisoned or deprived of liberty, and by
whom, if the person's name be known, or if it be not known, by
designating or describing his person, as far as possible.
SEC. 796.—If the imprisonment or detention exists, by vir
tue or under pretext of a judicial order, the copy of such order
shall be annexed to the petition, or the petitioner shall allege
that a copy of it has been demanded and refused.
SEC. 797.—If the imprisonment or detention took place by
virtue of a judicial order, regular in its form, but illegally ob
tained or executed, the petition shall mention in what the ille
gality consists.
SEC. 798.—If the imprisonment or detention has not been
made by virtue of a judicial order, the petitioner need only
allege that he is illegally imprisoned or confined.
SEC. 799. —The petition shall conclude by praying for a
habeas corpus ; the petitioner shall swear that it contains the
truth to the best of his belief.
SEC. 800.—The judge to whom this petition is presented,
if he has the power of issuing a habeas corpus, shall immedi
ately grant one to the petitioner, unless it appear by the peti
tion itself, or by the documents annexed to it, that the party
cannot be set at liberty, nor admitted to bail.
SEC. 801.—The habeas corpus may be granted iu court,
with the signature of the clerk and the seal uf the court, or out
of court under the signature alone of- the judge, to whom the
petition is presented.
SEC. 802. —The habeas corpus may be served by any free
white male person, capable of giving evidence.
SEC. 803. —The person to whom the writ is delivered, may
serve it by delivering it to the person to whom it is addressed,
or who keeps the party in confinement ; and if that person re
fuses to receive the writ, he who is charged to serve it shall
inform him of its contents.
But if the person to whom the habeas corpus is addressed,
conceals himself or refuses admittance to the person charged
to serve it on him, the latter shall affix the order on the exte
rior of the place where the person resides, or in which the pe
titioner is confined.
SEC. 804.—The service of the habeas corpus shall be prov
ed by the affidavit of the person directed to serve it.
SEC. 805.—It is the duty of the person on whom a habeas
corpus is served, whether it be directed to him or not, to obey
and return the order without delay, to the court which issu
ed it
SEC. 806.—Obedience to the habeas corpus is manifested
on the part of the person to whom it is directed, by his pro
ducing the person to be set at liberty, if that person be in his
custody ; and by making on the back of the order or separate
ly, his answer in writing, in the form and manner hereafter
directed.
SEC. 807. —The person on whom a habeas corpus is served,
shall declare positively in his answer :
1. Whether he has or has not in his power or custody, the
person to be set at liberty, or whether that person is confined
by him.
2. By what authority or for what cause he arrested or de
tained him.
SEC. 808. —If the person on whom a habeas corpus is
served had held the petitioner in confinement, or had detained
him within three days preceding the service, or had transfer
red the custody to another, he shall state particularly in his
answer to whom, at what time, for what cause, and by what
authority, he made the transfer.
SEC. 809. —If the prisoner be kept in custody by virtue
of a jvidicial order, the original of that order must be annexed
to the answer.
SEC. 810.—This answer must be signed and sworn to by
the person making it.
SEC. 811. —Whenever a habeas corpus shall have been ob
tained for a person who is confined by virtue of a final judg
ment, or order of any competent tribunal of civil or criminal
jurisdiction, the officer having the legal custody of such per
son need not produce him, unless specially ordered to do so,
notwithstanding such final judgment, in the cases laid down in
the following article, and it shall be sufficient for him to return
the habeas corpus, with his answer in writing annexing the
judgment or order by virtue of which the person is confined.
SEC. 812.—The judge may direct that the person confined
shall be produced before him, notwithstanding any final judg
ment, sentence, or order under which he may have been de
prived of liberty, if it appears to him, that from some cause
expressed in the affidavit on which the habeas corpus was
granted, or in the answer accompanying the return of the writ,
this production is necessary, to enable him to grant to the par
ty the relief prayed for.
SEC. 813.—The return of a habeas corpus shall be made
in twelve hours after its service, or sooner, if it be so ordered
by the writ, in every case where the place of confinement is
not more than twelve miles from that to which the return is
to be made.
If the person confined is at a greater distance, the time
for the return shall be increased one day for every twenty miles
distance, and so in proportion for shorter distances.
SEC. 814. —When the habeas corpus has been duly served;
if the party in whose favor it has been granted, is not produc
ed within the time above fixed, the judge who issued the writ,
shall issue a warrant to some officer of justice, commanding
him to arrest and take in charge the person who disobeyed the
writ, and to bring such person before him, to be proceeded
against according to law.
SEC. 815. —If the person thus brought before the judge,
refuses to deliver the habeas corpus which has been served up
on him, or to produce the party whom he was ordered to pro
duce in the cases where, according to the above provisions,
he might be compelled to do it, he shall be sent to prison, and
shall remain there until he obeys the habeas corpus ; and
shall be comdemned to pay all the costs of the proceeding, be
sides the action for false imprisonment, which the party may
institute against him.
SEC. 816.—Whenever, by reason of the sickness or infirm
ity of the party confined, he cannot be brought before the
judge, without endangering his life, he who has him in confine
ment, shall mention it in his answer on returning the habeas
corpus : and if this act be proved by the certificate of a phy
sician or surgeon, regularly authorized to practice, and by the
declaration of two other witnesses, and the signature of the
party confined, if he can write, if the answer appears to him
sufficient in other respects, the judge shall repair to the place
where the party is confined, if he can do it without quitting
the place of holding his usual sittings, otherwise he may de
termine on the habeas corpus, in the same manner as if the
party was produced before him.
SEC. 817.—If the person confining the petitioner, cannot
produce him, because he is dead, or through some other una
voidable accident, or overpowering force, he shall mention it
in his answer to the writ, but this fact, to form an excuse,
must be proved in a perfectly satisfactory manner to the
judge.
It is to be understood, that in this case, and in every other,
where the person confining another, is bound to make proof
of the causes which prevent producing him, proof to the con
trary may be offered by the person who obtained the habeas
corpus.
SEC. 818. —If the person kept in confinement is repre
sented before the judge, he may deny all the facts stated in
tbe answer to the habeas corpus, or he may allege others on
his side, to show that his detention or imprisonment is illegal,
or that he has a right to be set at liberty ; which denials and
allegations shall be made under oath.
SEC. 819. —The judge shall then proceed in a summary
manner to hear the testimony and the reasons adduced, as
well by the party confined as by the party confining, and shall
pronounce on the whole subject as the nature of the case may
require, and according to the rules hereafter established.
SEC. 820. —If the judge cannot pronounce immediately on
the habeas corpus, he may, until his judgment is rendered,
commit the party to the sheriff of the parish where the writ is
issued, or to such other person as the age of the party and
other circumstances may render proper.
SEC. 821.—If it appear to the judge, by the return of the
habeas corpus, or by the documents which accompany that
return, that the person whose liberation is solicited is detained
by virtue of an order rendered in a civil suit, or at the request
of an individual having an interest in his confinement, the
said judge shall not pronounce on the habeas corpus unless it
be proved to his satisfaction, that previous reasonable notice in
writing has been given to the plaintifff in such civil action, or
to any other party interested, or his agent or attorney, if they
are not more than twenty miles distant from the place where
the habeas corpus has been obtained.
SEC. 822. —If it appear to the judge, from the return to
tb.3 writ or from the accompanying documents that the party
is confined by the order of Bome tribunal, he can only restore
such party to liberty in the following cases :
1. "Where such tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction, as
defined by law :
2. Where the original imprisonment was lawful, but by
some act, omission or event which has since occurred, the par
ty becomes entitled to his liberty :
3. Where the order of imprisonment is deficient in some
legal requisite :
4. Where the order, although in due legal form, has been
rendered in a case where the law does not allow the issuing of
orders of arrest or imprisonment :
5. Where the order is in due form, but has been rendered
or executed by a person not authorized for that purpose, or
where the person detaining the prisoner is not the person to
whom the law has prescribed that duty :
6. Where the order appears to have been obtained under
false pretenses, or by corruption : .
7. Where there exists no general law, judgment, order or
decree of a court of justice, if it be in a civil suit, or sentence
of conviction, if in a criminal suit, to justify the imprison
ment:
SEC. 823.—The judge pronouncing on the habeas corpus
can no otherwise examine the validity or propriety of the judg
ment or decree of a regularly constituted tribunal, under
which the imprisonment has taken place ; and whenever it
shall appear to him that there exists sufficient legal ground for
the detention of the prisoner, on account of any offense with
which he may be charged, although the order of imprisonment
may have been rendered in an irregular and unauthorized
manner, or have been executed by a person not duly author
ized for the purpose, the judge shall render a new order of ar
rest, in regular form, directed to the proper officer, or admit
the party to bail, if the nature of the offense allows it.
SEC. 824. —But if it shall appear to the judge from the
return and annexed documents, or otherwise, that there is no
cause for arrest or confinement, or if he thinks that such ar
rest and confinement cannot legally continue, he shall imme
diately set the prisoner at liberty.
SEC. 825. —But if the judge decide that the party cannot
be released from confinement, nor admitted to bail, he shall
remand him to prison, or place him under the same custody
in which he was, if the detention was legal ; otherwise he
shall place him in the custody of the person to whom the law
confides such duties.
SEC. 826.—A party discharged from imprisonment under
a habeas corpus, in a criminal proceeding, through deficiency
of proof, or some important defect in the warrant of imprison
ment, may be arrested and confined anew, on satisfactory
proof, and under a legal warrant, although it be for the same
offense.
SEC. 827.—So also in a civil suit, a party who has been
released on account of illegality of the warrant under which
he is confined, or want of authority in the person confining
him, may be arrested anew and imprisoned, for the same cause
of action, provided it be done in a legal manner.
Seo. II.—Of other Orders which Courts of Justice may
render.
SEC. 828. —Besides the habeas coi-pus, there are four other
species of orders which courts of justice may issue, to wit :
1. The order directing the performance of some specific
act ; (writ of mandamus.)
2. The order forbidding further proceedings in a suit ; (writ
of prohibition.)
3. The order of which the object is to pronounce on the
validity of a judicial proceeding ; (writ of certiorari.)
4. The order of which the object is to prevent an usurpa
tion ; (writ of quo warranto!)
1. Of the order directing the performance of some specific act,
(writ of mandamus.)
SEC. 829. —This is an order issued in the name of the
State, by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, and addressed
to an individual, or corporation, or court of inferior jurisdiction,
directing it to perform some certain act, belonging to the place,
Juty, or quality with which it is clothed.
4 R. 227 ; 11 R. 285; see 11 L. 285.
SEC. 830. —The object of this order is to prevent a denial
of justice, or the consequence of defective police, and it should
thereforee be issued, in all cases where the law has assigned no
relief by the ordinary means, and where justice and reason re
quire that some mode should exist of redressing a wrong, or
an abuSe of any nature whatever.
4 R. 227.
SEC. 831. —This order may be issued, at the discretion of
the judge, even when a party has other means of relief, if the
slowness of ordinary legal forms, is likely to produce such a
delay that the public good and the administration of justice
will suffer from it.
3 M. 171, 182 ; 5 M. 271 ; 2 N. S. 571 ; 4 N. S. 189 ; 7 N. S. 1 ; 2 L. 88, 394, 503 ;

though legally chosen, or whom they shall have removed with
out sufficient cause.
5 L. 332; 6 L. 598; 7 L. 511,'9 L. 332; 11 L. 369; see S67.
SEC. 836.—This order, in all the above-mentioned cases,
can only be issued by courts whose jurisdiction in civil matters
exceeds the sum of three hundred dollars.
SEC. 837. —It may be directed more particularly to judges
of inferior courts, commanding them to render justice, and to
perform the other duties of their office conformably to law.
1 A. 25.
SEC. 838. —In this last case, the order (or writ of manda
mus) issues not only when the judges of inferior courts are
guilty of a denial of justice or unreasonable delay, in pronounc
ing judgment on causes before them, but also if they refuse or
neglect to perform any of the duties required of them by law,
or which may enable the superior courts to exercise their ap
pellate jurisdiction.
SEC. 839. —It is only the court which exercises appellate
jurisdiction over an inferior court that can direct to the latter

of the cases mentioned in this paragraph, must apply to any
competent tribunal by petition, stating the nature of his right,
or of the injury he sustains, or of the denial of justice which
he experiences, and shall make oath of the truth of the facts
thus alleged.
SEC. 841. —The court to whom the complaint is addressed,
if it thinks there is ground for interposing its authority, shall
issue an order addressed to the party or to the inferior judge,
against whom the complaint is made, by which he shall he
directed to do what has been demanded of him, or show cause
to the contrary, within a certain time after the service of the
order, to be fixed by the court.
SEC. 842. —If, on the day assigned for answering the order,
the party or judge to whom it is directed answers and states
sufficient reasons to justify his conduct, the complaint shall be
dismissed, and the petitioner sentenced to pay costs.

by an appellate court of competent jurisdiction, and directed to
the judge and to the party suing, in a suit before an inferior
court, forbidding them to proceed further in the cause, on the
ground that the cognizance of the said cause does not belong
to such court, but to another, or that it is not competent to
decide it.
SEC. 847. —To obtain this mandate, the defendant who
complains that the inferior court wishes to transcend its juris
diction, shall apply by petition to the court having cognizance
of appeals from such inferior court, stating the cause and na
ture of the action brought against him, and showing that the
said court is not competent to try it.
SEC. 848. —The court to which this petition is offered,
shall require the oath of the petitioner to the truth of the facts
stated in it, unless these facts be proved by the mere ex
amination of the prayer, or of the proceedings which took place
before the inferior court.
19 L. 174; 1 R. 550.
SEC. 849.—If the court shall think that the matters stated

give a written answer to the order, after which the court is
suing it shall pronounce finally and summarily on the right of

competent to judge the cause, it shall render its prohibition
perpetual, otherwise it shall allow the judge to proceed to the
trial and judgment of the case.

SEC. 852. —If, in contempt of the order, the judge or the *
party shall proceed any further in the suit, the superior tri
bunal shall cause them to be arrested, and shall punish them
for such contempt, and the opposite party shall have an action
for his damages against them.
SEC. 853. —If an inferior judge has rendered judgment in
a case where he had not jurisdiction, and the execution has
issued, the court may direct its order as well to the party pro
secuting, as to the officer charged with the execution, forbid
ding them to proceed in the execution, in the same manner as
if the prohibition had been addressed to the judge before issu
ing the order of execution, and under the same penalties above
enacted.

inferior judge to proceed no further in the case, until judg
ment shall be pronounced on the regularity of his proceed
ings.
SEC. 857. —This mandate is only granted in cases where
the suit is to be decided in the last resort, and where there

without having cited him to appear.

SEC. 863. —The mere service of the order to send up the
record, renders void every act which may have been subse
quently performed by the judge to whom it was directed, or by
his order.
SEC. 864.—If upon examining the certified record thus
sent, it shall appear to the court issuing the mandate, that the
proceedings are null and ha\;e not been sanctioned by the party

the provisions of the law.

is brought up, he files in the supreme court a written paper,
stating specially such errors as he alleges ; otherwise his ap
peal shall be rejected.

appeal to the supreme court shall be dismissed on account of
any defect, error, or irregularity in the petition or order of ap

tion of appeal or service thereof, or because the appeal was not
made returnable at the next term of the supreme court, when
ever it shall not appear that such defect, error, or irregularity
is imputable to the appellant, but in all such cases the court

case, permit the appellant to withdraw his appeal, without the
consent of the appellee, and the cause shall take its course,
whether the appellant make default or not.
SEC. 902. —Although in general, parties before the su
preme court are not allowed to plead other matters than those
which were before the inferior court, nevertheless it may depart
from this rule, when the exception taken is one of those which
may be pleaded at any period of a cause, and the proof of it
appears by the mere examination of the record.
Thus prescription may be pleaded before the supreme court,
when the proof of it appears on the face of the proceedings in
the lower court. But the party to whom it is opposed shall
have the privilege of demanding that the cause be remanded
for trial upon that plea.

peace for a specific object, or any movable of a value within
