in such
name
as is
authorized
by
law, and
official
bonds
may be

i.a
the same way.
� 27.
Where
a
married
woman

action
concerns 
her

infant,
if
he
be
of
the
age
of
fourteen
years,
and 
apply
within
twenty
days
after the
return
of the summons.
If he
be under

a
defendant,
who
has
or
claims
an
interest
in
the
controversy
adverse
to
the
plaintifff,
or

is
a
necessary
party
to
a
complete
determination
or
settlement of
the question involved
therein.
� 35. Of the parties
to the action, those who are
united
b
in interest
must be joined,
as plaintifffs
or defendants;
but

one who should have
been joined as
plaintifff,
can
not
be
obtained,
he may
be made
a defendant,
the reason being stated in the petition.
� 36. When
the question
is one of a
common or general
interest
of many
persons; or
when the
parties are
very
numerous, and it
may be impracticable to
bring them all
before the court,
one or more may sue or
defend for the
benefit of all.
� 37. Persons
severally
liable
upon
the same
obligation
or
instrument,
including
the
parties
to
bills
of

same
action,
at
the
option
of
the
plaintifff.

action
does not abate
by the
death, marriage,
or
other

a party,

by
the
transfer
of
any
inte-
rest
therein,
during
its pendency,
if the

or continue.
In the
case of
a marriage
of
a female
party,
the
fact
being
suggested
on
the
record,
the
husband
may be
made a party with his wife;
and in the case of the
death or
other disability of a party,
the court may allow
the action to continue
by or against his
representative or
successor
in interest.
In case of
any other transfer
of interest,

the action
may be continued in the
name of the ori-
ginal party; or the court may allow the person to whom the
transfer is made, to be substituted in the action.
�
39.
The
court
may
determine
any
controversy
between
parties
before
it, when
it
can
be
done
without
prejudice
to the rights
of others, or by
saving their rights;
but when
a determination
of
the
controversy
can
not
be
had
without
the presence
of other
parties, the
court must
order them to
be brought in.

a party,
the court
may
order
it to
be done.

a defendant before
answer in
an action upon contract, or for the recovery of personal
property,

third party, without
collusion
with him,
has or
makes a claim
to the subject
of the action
and that 
he
is ready
to
pay or
dispose
of
the same,
as
the court
may
direct,
the court may
make an order
for the safe keeping,
or for
the payment, or deposit
in court, or delivery
of the
subject
of the action, to such person
as it may direct, and
an order requiring such
third party to appear in
a reasonable

time and maintain
or relinquish his claim
against the
defendant.
If
such
third
party
being
served
with
a copyIf 
of
the order,
by the sheriff
or such
other
person as
the court
may
direct,
fail
to
appear,
the
court
may
declare
him
barred 
of all claim in respect
to the subject of the action,
against
the
defendant
therein.
If
such
third
party
appear,
he shall 
be allowed
to
make
himself
defendant
in
the
action,
in
lien
of the original defendant,
who shall be discharged
from all
liability to either of the
other parties in respect
to the subject
of

the action, upon
his compliance with the
order of
the court for the payment,
deposit, or delivery
thereof.

of

last
section
shall

ble to an
action brought
against a sheriff,
or other
officer, 
for the recovery
of personal property taken
by him under
execution,
or for
the proceeds
of such property
so taken
and sold by him.
And the defendant
in such action shall
be entitled to
the benefit of those provisions
against the
party,
in whose favor the execution
issued, upon exhibiting
to the court
the process
under which he
acted, with his
affidavit
that the
property, for
the recovery
of which,
or
its proceeds,
the action is brought, was
taken under such
process.

upon
application
of
the
defendant
and

the
party
in
whose 
favor
the

issued,
permit
the latter
to

tuted as
the defendant,

for the costs
being given.

or
the
person
having
the
care
or

Of 
the

shall
allow him,
with
or without

CHAPTER

ANSWER.
SEC.
91.
The
answer
shall
contain,
1. A
general
or specific
denial
of each
material
allega- 
tion
of
the
petition
controverted
by
the
defendant. 
2.
A
statement
of
any
new
matter
constituting
a
defense,
counterclaim
or set-off,
in ordinary
and concise
language
and without
repetition.
�
92. The
defendant
may
set forth
in
his
answer
as
many
grounds
of defense,
counterclaim
and
set-off
as he
may 
have.
Each must
be
separately
stated
and
numbered,
and
they
must
refer
in
an
intelligible
manner
to
the
cause
of
action
which
they are
intended
to answer.
�
93. The
counter
claim,
mentioned
in
the last
section,
must
be one
existing
in faver
of
a defendant,
and against
a
plaintifff,
between
whom
a
several
judgment
might
be
bad
in the action,
and arising
out of the
contract
or transaction

set

forth
in the petition
as the
foundation
of the
plaintifff's claim, or
connected with the subject
of the action.
�
94.
If
the
defendant
omit
to
set
up
the
counterclaim
or
set-off, he
can not recover
costs against
the plaintifff in
any
subsequent
action thereon;
but this
section shall
not apply
to
causes
of
action
which
are
stricken
out
of,
or withdrawn
from
the answer,
as provided
in sections
ninety-five and
one
hundred
and eighteen.
�
95.
When
it
appears
that
a new
party
is
necessary
to
a final
decision upon
the counterclaim,
the court
may either
permit
the
new
party
to
be
made
by
a
summons,
to
reply
to
the
counterclaim, or may
direct the counterclaim
to be
stricken
out of the answer,
and made the subject
of a
separate action.
� 96.
A
set-off
can
only
be
pleaded
in
an
action
founded
on contract,
and
must
be a
cause
of action
arising
upon
contract,
or
ascertained
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
�
97.
When
it
appears
that
a
new
party
is
necessary
to
a final decision upon the set-off, the court shall permit the
new
party
to
be
made,
if
it
also
appear
that
owing
to
the
insolvency
or
non-residence
of
the
plaintifff,
or
other
cause,
the defendant will be in
danger of losing his claim,
unless
permitted
to use
it as a set-off.
� 98.
When
cross
demands
have
existed
between
persons
under
such
circumstances,
that
if one
had
brought
an
action
against
the other,
a counterclaim
or
set-off could
have
been
set
up,
neither
can
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
thereof,
by the assignment or
death or the other, but
the two demands

must be deemed
compensated, so far as
they equal
each other.
.�
99.
The
guardian
of
an
infant
or
person
of
an
unsound
mind, or
attorney for
a person in prison,
shall deny
in the
answer
all material
allegations
of the
petition
prejudicial
to
such defendant.
CHAPTER
V.
REPLY.
SEc.
100. There
shall be no
reply, except
upon the allegation

of a counterclaim or set-off in the answer.
� 101.
When
the
answer
contains
new
matter,
constitut-
ing
a counterclaim
or set-off,
the
plaintifff
may
reply
to
such
new matter, denying generallyor
specifically each allegation
controverted by
him; and he may allege, in ordinary and
concise language
and without repetition,
any new matter
not inconsistent with
the petition, constituting
a defense
such new matter
in the answer; or he may
demur to the
same for insufficiency,
stating in his demurrer
the grounds
thereof:
and he may
demur to one
or more of
such defenses
set up
in the answer,
and
reply to the
residue.

or person of
unsound mind,
or a person

and certain
by amendment.

submission
of

of

another
action.

counterclaim or set-off
is withdrawn, an action

MISTAKES
IN
PLEADING,
AND
AMENDMENTS.
SEC.
130.
No variance
between
the
allegation
in
a pleading

and

the

prodf,

is

to

be

deemed
material,
unless
it
have
theaculypry
redi,
actually
misled
the adverse
party to his
prejudice,
in main-
taining
his
action
or
defense
upon
the
merits.
Whenever
it is
alleged, that
a party has
been so misled,
that fact
must
be proved
to the satisfaction of
the court, and it must also
be shown
in what respect he has
been misled; and thereupon
the

court

may order the pleading
to be amended, upon
such
terms as
may be just.
�
131. When
the
variance
is not
material,
as provided
in
the
last
section,
the
court
may
direct
the
fact
to
be
found,
according to the evidence,
and may order an immediate
amendment
without
costs.
� 132.
When,
however,
the allegation
of
the claim
or defense,

to

which

the

proof

is

directed,

is

unproved,

not

in
some particular,
or particulars only, but
in its general scope
and meaning, it is
not to be deemed a
case of variance
within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
� 133.
The plaintifff
may
amend
his petition
without
leave,
at
any
time
before
the
answer
is
filed,
without
proju-
fiepIa
dice to the proceeding; but notice of such amendment shall
be
served
upon
the
defendant,
or
his
attorney,
and
the
defendant

shall have the same time to answer or demur
thereto,
as to
the original
petition.
�
134.
At
any
time
within
ten
days
after
a
demurrer
is
filed, the
adverse party may amend, of
course, on payment
of costs since filing the defective pleading. Notice of
filing an
amended pleading,
shall
be forthwith
served upon
the other party, who
shall have the same time
thereafter to
answer, or reply thereto,
as to an original pleading.
� 135. Upon
a demurrer being overruled,
the party who
demurred
may
answer
or
reply, if
the court
be
satisfied 
that
he
has
a
meritorious
claim,
or
defense,
and
did
not
de,
mur for
delay.
� 136.
The
court may,
before
judgment,
in furtherance
of
justice,
and
on such
terms
as may
be proper,
amend
any 
pleading, process or proceeding,
by adding or
striking out
the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake
in the
nafne of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect, or by
inserting other allegations material to the
case, or, when
the amendment
does not
change substantially
the
claim or
defense, by conforming
the pleading or proceeding
to the
facts proved. And whenever
any proceeding
taken by a
party fails to conform,
in any respect, to the provisions
of
this code, the court may
permit the same to be
made conformable

thereto,

by
amendment.
� 137.
The
court,
in
every
stage
of an
action,
must
dis-
regard
any
error
or
defect
in
the
pleadings
or
proceedings, 
which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse
party; and no
judgment shall be reversed,
or affected, by
reason
of such error
or defect.
�
138. If the
demurrer
be sustained,
the
adverse
party
may amend,
if the defect can be
remedied, by way of 
amendment, with, or without costs, as the court in its diS-allowed.
cretion shall direct.
�
139.
When
either
party
shall
amend
any
pleading,
or
proceeding,
and the court
shall be satisfied
by affidavit,
or 
otherwise, that
the adverse party could not
be ready for 
trial in consequence
thereof, a continuance
may be granted
to some day in term, or to another term of the court.
� 140.
When the
plaintifff
shall be
ignorant
of the
name
of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any 
pleading
or proceeding by
any name and description,
and
when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceed
ing may be
amended accordingly.
The plaintifff in such
case must state, in the verification of his petition, that he
could not discover the true name, and the summons must
contain the words,
"real name unknown,"
and a copy
thereof must
be served personally
upon the defendant.
� 141.
Either
party
may
be
allowed
on
notice,
and
Oil 
such
terms
as
to costs,
as the
court
may
prescribe,
to
file
a
supplemental
petition,
answer,
or
reply,
alleging
facts 
material
to
the
case,
occurring
after
the
former
petition,
answer, or reply.
�
142.
Whenever
two or
more
actions
are
pending
in
the
same court,
which
might
have
been
joined,
the
defendant 
may, on motion
and notice to the adverse
party, require
him
to
show
cause
why
the
same
shall
not
be
consolidated,
and if
no such cause
be shown,
the said
several actions
shall
be consolidated.
.joined, 
� 143. The order
for consolidation
may be
made by the
court,
or
by
a
judge
thereof
in
vacation.

shall
not
be issued
by
the
clerk, until there has been executed, by one or more suf- 
ficient
sureties of the plaintifff,
a written undertaking,
to
the effect that the plaintifff shall pay to the defendant all
damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, if
the order
be wrongfully obtained,
not exceeding double the
amount
of the plaintifff's claim
stated in the affidavit.
� 147.
The order
may

� 149. The return day of the order of arrest, when issued
at the commencement
of the suit,
shall be the same as that
of the summons;
when issued afterwards,
it shall be fifteen
days after it issued.
� 150.
The sheriff
shall
execute
the order
by
arresting
the defendant, and delivering to him a copy thereof, and of
the affidavit. If
the defendant can not
be found before
the return day, the plaintifff shall be entitled to further

sureties
shall be liable, and may
be proceeded against,
for any
default
in relation
thereto,
as
in other cases
of delinquency.

156.
Bail
may
be
given
by
the
defendant
on
his
arrest,
or at
any time
afterwards,
before
judgment.
It shall
be
done by causing one or more
sufficient bail to execute
a
written undertaking
to the plaintifff,
in the presence
of the
sheriff,
to the
effect that,
if judgment
shall be
rendered
in
the action
against the defendant,
he will render himself
amenable
to
the process
of
the court
thereon.
The
undertaking,

when

accepted,shall

be

returned

to

the

clerk's

office,
and the defendant
discharged.
�
157.
The
plaintifff,
or
his
attorney,
may
object
to
the
bail
for
insufficiency,
at
any
time
within
ten
days
after
the
undertaking
of
the bail
has been
given;
within
such time
he shall
serve
upon the
sheriff
a written
notice
that
he does
not accept
the bail, or
he shall be
deemed to have
accepted
it, and
the sheriff
shall
be exonerated
from
liability.
When
the undertaking
is given
after
the return
of the
order
of
arrest, the plaintifff
shall have notice
thereof.
� 158.
On
the
receipt
of
such
notice,
the
sheriff,
or
defendant may, within ten days thereafter, give to the
plaintifff,
or his
attorney,
notice
in writing
of the
justification

of

the same,
or other bail,
before a
judge, or clerk
of
the court,
in which the
action is brought,
a county
judge, or
justice
of the
peace, at
a specified
time
and place:
the time
to be
not less
than five
nor more
than
ten days
thereafter.
In case
other bail
be given,
there
must
be a
new undertaking.
� 159. For
the
purpose
of justification,
each
of the
bail
must
attend
before
the
proper
officer
at
the
time
and
place
mentioned,
and
may
be examined
on
oath or
affirmation
touching
his sufficiency,
in such
manner
as the
officer
may
think proper.
�
160.
If
the
officer
finds
the
bail
sufficient,
he
shall
indorse his allowance on the undertaking, and cause the
same to
be filed with the clerk;
and the sheriff shall there-
upon
be discharged
from liability.
�
161.
If
after
being
arrested,
the
defendant
escape
or
be
rescued,
or bail be
not taken or be
adjudged insufficient,
or
a deposit
be
not
made,
the
sheriff
shall
be
'liable
as
bail.
But he may discharge
himself from liability
by putting in
sufficient
bail at
any time
before judgment.
�
162.
The
return
of
"
not
found"
upon
an
execution
against
the body
of the
defendant,
shall
be
necessary
to
fix
the
liability
of the
sheriffas
bail,
which
liability
shall
be
the amount
of
the judgment,
interest
and
cost. This
liability
can be
enforced
only,
in a separate
action
against
him,
or
against him
and his sureties
on his
official bond,
as in other
cases of delinquency.
� 163.
The bail adjudged
insufficient,
shall be liable
to
the
sheriff for
the damages
he may
sustain by
reason ofble 
such insufficiency.
� 164.
The
liability
of
the bail
shall
be fixed
in
the
man-
ner
provided
in
section
one
hundred
and
sixty-two,
for
fix- 
ing the
liability
of
the sheriff
as
bail,
and the
bail
can be
proceeded against in an action only.
� 165.
A surrender
of the defendant
to the
sheriff of the
.county
in which
he
was
arrested,
with
a
delivery
of
a cer- 
tified copy
of the undertaking of
the bail, whether such
surrender
be
made
by
the
defendant
himself
or
by
his
bail,
shall discharge the bail; and such surrender may be made
at any time before
the return day of the
summons in an
action against
the bail.
The sheriff shall
give to the bail
a
written acknowledgment of the surrender, and hold the
defendant
in his custody
upon said
copy of the
undertaking
of
the bail, as upon
an order of
arrest. On
the production
of the sheriff's acknowledgment of the surrender, to the
clerk of the court,
an exoneration of the
bail shall be
entered on his undertaking.
� 166. For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, the
bail,
at
any
time
or
place,
before
he
is
finally
charged,
may 
himself arrest him,
or by a written authority
indorsed on a
certified copy of the undertaking,
may empower any person
of suitable age and discretion to do so.
� 167. The bail will be exonerated by the death of the
defendant,
or
his
imprisonment
in
a
state
prison,
or
by
his 
legal discharge from the obligation to render himself
amenable to the process of the court, or by his surrender
to the
sheriff of the county
in which he was
arrested in
execution thereof,
within the time fixed in
section one hundred

and sixty-five, or within such further time as the court
in which the action is pending may allow.
� 168.
If money
be
deposited
by the
defendant
in his dis-ni
charge,
bail
may
be
given
and
justified
upon
notice
as 
prescribed
in section
one hundred
and fifty-eight
at any
time before judgment;
and thereupon the
court in which
the action is brought,
on being satisfied that
the bail has
-been given and
adjudged sufficient, shall
direct that the
money deposited be refunded to the defendant, and it must
be refunded
accordingly,
� 169.
If,
at
any
time
before
or
after
judgment
against
the
bail,
proceedings
in
error
are
commenced,
on
the
jud1-inesagainst 
ment against
the principal
in the suit,
in which theirali 
undertaking
was
taken,
the
court
may,
on motion,
stay
pro- 
ceedings against such bail for a reasonable time, on their
paying
all the costs that have
accrued against them;
and
if,
on such proceedings, the
judgment against the principal
shall be reversed, and the principal discharged from said
suit, the bail shall be discharged from the undertaking.

county
than
the one in which the action is brought, for the delivery of
the
property
claimed.

taxed in the costs, unless other-
wise ordered
by the court.

after

having demanded
the same.
� 188. No suit shall
be instituted on the undertaking
given
under
section
one
hundred
and
seventy-eight,
before
an execution
issued on a judgment
in favor
of the defendant
in the action, shall

sufficient property,

whereon

to levy and
make the amount of such

causing a summons to
be issued upon it; and thereupon
such
proceedings may be had
as in other actions, and

the plaintifff,
for the amount

in the
possession of the garnishee,

defendant, and for the
costs of the
proceedings against the
garnishee. If the plaintifff
proceed
against the garnishee
by action, for the cause
that his disclosure

was

unsatisfactory, unless it
appear in the action
that
such disclosure
was incomplete,
the
plaintifff shall
pay
the costs of such action. The judgment in this action may
be enforced as judgments
in other cases.
When the claims
of the plaintifffs
in attachment
are satisfied,
the
defendant
in attachment
may, on motion,
be substituted
as the
plaintifff
in the judgment.
� 218. Final judgment
shall not be rendered
against the
garnishee,
until the action
against the
defendant in
attach-
ment has been
determined; and if
in such action judgment

for the defendant
in attachment, the

monies,
and credits
of the
defendant in
his possession,
and pay
all
the monies
from him due as the
court may order, the
garnishee
shall be discharged,
and the costs of the
pro-
ceedings
against him shall
be paid out of the property
and monies
so surrendered,
or
as the court
may think right
and proper.

rendered
in
the
action
for tle
defendant,
the attachment
shall
be discharged,
and

its proceeds
shall
be returned
to
him.

be rendered
for
the plaintifff,,
it shall
be satisfied
as follows:
So
much
of the
property
remain- 
ing
in the
hands
of
the
officer,
after
applying
the
monies
arising from
the sale of perishable
property,
and so
much 
of the
personal
property
and
lands
and
tenements,
if
any,
whether
held
by legal or equitable
title,
as may be
neces-
sary
to satisfy the
judgment,
shall be sold
by order of the
court, under
the same restrictions and
regulations, as if the
same
had been levied
on by
execution;
and the money
arising therefrom,
with the amount which
may be recovered
from the garnishee,
shall be applied to
satisfy the judgment
and costs.
If there
be not enough
to satisfy
the same,
the
judgment
shall
stand,
and the
execution
may
issue
thereon,
for the residue
in all respects as in other
cases. Any sur-
plus
of the
attached
property,
or
its
proceeds,
shall
be
returned
to the defendant.
� 221. The
court may compel
the delivery to
the sheriff, for
sale
of any
of
the
attached
property
for
which
an
undertaking
may have been given, and
may proceed summarily on such
undertaking,
to
enforce
the
delivery
of
the
property,
or
the
payment
of
such sum
as may
be
due upon
the
undertaking,

by

rules

and

attachments
as in
cases
of contempt.
� 222.
The court
may order
the
sheriff to
repossess
himself,

for the
purpose of selling it, any
of the attached pro-
perty which may have passed
out of his hands without
having
been
sold or converted
into money;
and
the sheriff.
shall,
under
such order,
have
the same
power
to take
the
property,
as
he would have
under an
order of attachment.
� 223.
If personal
property which
has been attached,
be
claimed
by
any
person
other
than
the
defendant,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
officer
to
have
the
validity
of
such
claim
tried and such proceedings
must be had thereon,
with the
like effect,
as in case
the property
had been
seized upon
execution, and claimed by a third person.
� 224.
Where
several
attachments
are
executed
on
the
same
property,
or
the
same
persons
are
made
garnishees,
the
court,
on
the
motion
of
any
of
the
plaintifffs,
may
order
a reference to ascertain
and report the amounts
and priori-
ties of the several attachments.

refrain
from
a particular
act.
It may
be
the final
judgment
in an action,
or
may be
allowed
as a provisional
remedy;
and when
so allowed,
it
shall be
by order.
The
writ
of injunction
is abolished.

When
it
appears
by
the
petition,
that
the
plaintifff
is entitled
to the relief demanded;
and such relief, or any
part
thereof,
consists
in restraining
the commission
or continuance

of

some
act, the
commission
or
continuance
of
which,
during
the
litigation,
would
produce
great
or irreparable

injury

to

the

plaintifff,
or when,
during
litigation,
it
appears
that the
defendant
is doing,
or
threatens,
or is
about
to
do, or is
procuring,
or suffering
to be done,
some
act in violation
of the
plaintifff's
rights, respecting
the subject

of

the

action,
and
tending
to
render
the
judgment
ineffectual,

temporary

injunction

may

be
granted
to
restrain
such act. It may
also be granted in any
case where it is
specially
authorized by
statute.

its
appearing

the
affidavit
of the
plaintifff
or his
agent,
that the
plaintifff
is
entitled
thereto.

party to the suit, should be
heard before
givenma

the
injunction,

for
such
purpose

a
specified
time and
place, and
may,
in the meantime,
restrain
such party.

An injunction
shall
not
be granted
against
a party
who has answered,
unless upon notice; but such
party may
be restrained, until

provided by special
statute,

clerk of the
court granting

amount to be fixed by
the court or judge
allowing the
same, to secure to the
party enjoined the
damages
he may sustain,
if it
be finally decided
that
the
injunction
ought
not to have
been granted.
� 242.
The
order
of injunction
shall
be addressed
to the
party
enjoined,
shall
state
the injunction,
and
shall be
issued 
by the clerk. Where the
injunction is allowed at the
con-
mencement
of
the action,
the
clerk shall
endorse
upon
the
summons
" injunction
allowed,"
and it
shall not
be necessary

to
issue the
order of
injunction;
nor
shall it
be necessary

to
issue the
same,
where
notice
of the application
therefore
has been
given
to the party
enjoined.
The
service
of the summons
so endorsed,
or
the notice
of the
application

for an
injunction,
shall be notice

litiga-
tion
and
without
notice
of
the
application
therefore,
the 
order of
injunction
shall
be issued,
and
the sheriff
forthwith

serve
the same
upon
each party
enjoined,
in
the manner

prescribed
for serving
a summons,
and make
return
thereof without
delay.
� 244. An injunction binds the party, from the time he
has
notice
thereof,
and
the
undertaking
required
by
the ap-
plicant
therefore,
is
executed.
� 245.
No
injunction
shall
be
granted
by a
judge,
after
motion
therefore
has
been
overruled
on
the
merits
of
the
ap- 
plication,
by
his court,
and
where
it has been
refused
by
the
court in
which
the action
is brought,
or
a judge
thereof,
it shall not
be granted to
the same applicant,
by
a court of
inferior
jurisdiction
or any judge
thereof.
�
246.
An
injunction
granted
by
a
judge
may
be
enforced,
as
the
act
of
the
court.
Disobedience
of
an
injunction
may 
be punished
as a contempt,
by the court
or any judge,
who
might have
granted it in
vacation.
An attachment
may be
issued by the
court or judge,
upon being
satisfied
by affidavit

of the breach
of the
injunction, against
the party
guilty
of the same;
and he may
be required,
in the discretion
of
the court or
judge, to pay
a fine not
exceeding two
hundred
dollars for the
use of the
county, to
make immediate
restitution

to the
party injured,
and give
further security,
to
obey the injunction;
or
in default thereof,
he may
be committed

to close
custody,
until be shall
fully comply
with
such requirement,
or be otherwise
legally discharged.
�
247. A party
enjoined
may,
at any
time before
judg-Partyenjoined
to
te prty ho as
otaied 
ment,
upon
reasonable
notice
to the
party
who
has
obtained
the injunction,
move
the court
for additional
security;
and
if it appear
that
the surety
in the
undertaking
has
removed
from
the
territory,
or
is insufficient,
the
court
may
vacate
the injunction,
unless
in
a reasonable
time
sufficient
security
be given.
� 248.
On the bearing
of an
application
for an
injunction,
each
party
may read
affidavits.
All
affidavits
shall be
filed.
� 249. If the injunction
be granted without notice,
the
defendant,
at any
time
before
the
trial,
may
apply,
upon
notice,
to
the
court
in
which
the
action
is
brought,
or
any
judge thereof,
to vacate or modify the
same. The applica-
tion may be made upon the petition and affidavits upon
which the injunction is granted, or upon affidavits on the
part of the party enjoined, with or without answer. The
order of the judge allowing, dissolving, or
modifying an
injunction, shall be returned to the office of the clerk of the
court in which the action is brought, and recorded
and
obeyed, as if made by the court.
�
250.
If
the
application
be
made
upon
affidavits
on
the
part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintifff may
oppose the same to affidavits
or other evidence,
in addition
to that on
which the injunction
was granted.
� 251.
A defendant
may
obtain
an injunction
upon
an
answer
in
the
nature
of
a counterclaim.
He
shall
proceed
in
the
manner
prescribed 
in
this
chapter.

264.
The

mode
of summoning,
impanneling,
challenging,
and
swearing
a jury, is
not changed
by this
code.
SUBDIVISION 2.
Conduct
of the Trial.
� 264. When the jury has been sworn, the trial shall 
proceed
in
the
following
order,
unless
the
court
for
special
reasons
otherwise
direct:
1. The plaintifff must
briefly state his claim,
and may
briefly state the evidenee by which he expects to sustain
it.
2. The defendant must
then briefly state his defense,
and
may briefly state the evidence he expects to offer in support

of it.
3. The party
who would be defeated
if no evidence were
given on either side, must first procure his evidence; the
adverse party will
then produce his
evidence.
4. The
parties will then be confined
to rebutting evidence,

unless the court,
for good reasons in
furtherance
of justice,
permits them to offer
evidence in their
original
case.
5. When the evidence
is concluded, either
party may
request instructions to
the jury on points of
law, which
shall be given or refused
by the court; which
instructions
shall be reduced
to writing, if either party
require it.
6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to the
jury.
In
the
argument,
the
party
required
first
to
produce
his evidence,
shall have the opening
and conclusion.
If
several defendants
having separate defenses,
appear by
different counsel, the court shall arrange their relative
order.
7. The court may again charge the jury after the argument
is

concluded.
� 266.
Whenever,
in
the opinion
of the
court,
it is
proper
for the jury to have
a view of property which
is the
subject
of
litigation,
or
of
the
place
in
which
any
mjaterial
fact
occurred, 
it
may
order
them
to
be
conducted 
in
a
body
under the
charge
of an
officer to
the place,
which
shall
be
shown
to them
by
some
person
appointed
by the
court
for
that
purpose.
While
the
jury
are
thus
absent,
no
person
other than
the person
so
appointed,
shall
speak to
them
on
any subject connected
with the
trial.
� 267. When the case is finally submitted to
the jury,
they
may
decide
in
court
or
retire
for
deliberation.
If
they
retire, they must
be kept together
in some
convient
place, under
the
charge
of an officer
until
they agree
upon
a verdict, or
are discharged
by the
court, subject
to the
discretion
of the court
to permit
them to separate
temporarily

at
night, and
at their meals.
The officer
having
them under
his charge,
shall not suffer
any communication
to be made
to them, or
make any
himself, except
to ask
them if
the have
agreed
upon their
verdict,
unless
by order
of the court,
and he shall
not before
their verdict
is rendered,

communicate
to
any person the
state of
their deliberations

or the
verdict agreed
upon.
�
268. If
the jury
are permitted
to separate
either
during
courtthtraosal
the trial,
or
aft r
the case
is
submitted
to
them,
they
shall
be
admonished
by
the
court
that
it is
their
duty
not
to
con-
verse with, or suffer
themselves to be addressed
by any
other person,
on any subject
of the
the trial, and
that it is
their
duty
not to form
or express
any
opinion
thereon,
until
the
cause is
finally
submitted
to them.
� 269. After
the jury have retired for deliberation,
if
there
be
a
disagreement
between
them
as to
any
part
of
the testimony,
or if
they
desire
fo be
informed
as to
any
part
of
the
law
arising
in
the
case,
they
may
request
the
officer to conduct them to the court, where the information
upon the point of law shall be given, and the court may
give its recollection
as
to the testimony
on the point
in dis-
pute, in the
presence of,
or after notice
to the
parties of
their counsel.
� 270.
The
jury
may be
discharged
by
the court
on
account

of

the
sickness
of a juror,
or other
accident
or
calamity
requiring
their
discharge,
or
by
consent
of
both
parties, or after they have
been kept together until
it satisfactorily

appears
that there
is no probability
of their
agree-
ing.
� 271. In
all cases where the
jury are discharged
during
the
trial,
or
after
the
cause
is submitted
to them,
it may
be
tried
again
immediately 
or
at
a
future
time,
as
the
court
may direct.
� 272.
When
the
jury
have
agreed
upon
their
verdict,
they
must
be
conducted
into
court,
their
names
called
by
the clerk,
and
the
verdict
rendered
by the
foreman.
When 
the verdict
is announced, either party may require the jury
to be polled, which is done by the clerk asking each juror
if it
is his verdict.
If any
one answers
in the negative,
the
jury must again
be sent
out for further
deliberation.
�
273.
The
verdict
shall
be
written,
signed
by
the
fore-
man,
and
read
by
the
clerk
to
the
jury,
and
the
inquiry 
made whether
it is their verdict.
If any
juror disagrees,
the jury must
be sent out
again; but
if no disagreement
be
expressed,
and
neither
party
requires
the
jury
to be
polled,
the
verdict is complete,
and
the jury discharged
from
the
case. If, however, the verdict
be defective in form only,
the
same way, with
the assent of the jury
before they are 
discharged, be
corrected by the
court.
SUBDIvIsIoN 3.
Verdict.
� 274.
The
verdict
of
a
jury
is
either
general
or
spe-Theverdictmay
cial.
A
general
verdict
is
that
by
which
they
pronounce, 
generally, upon all or
any of the issues, either
in favor of
the plaintifff
or
defendant.
A
special
verdict
is that
by
which the jury
finds the
facts only.
It must present
Ihe
facts as established
by
the evidence,
and not the
evidence
to prove them;
and they
must be so
presented
as that nothing
remains

to

the court,
but to draw
from them
conclu-
sions of law.
�
275.
In
every
action
for
the
recovery
of
money
only,
or
specific
real
property,
the
jury, in
their discretion,
may 
render
a general or
special verdict.
In all other cases,
thea
court may direct the jury
to find a special verdict
in writing
upon all or any of the
issues; and in all cases may
instruct
them if they
render a general
verdict,
to find upon
particular

questions
of fact to
be stated in
writing, and
may direct
a written finding thereon.
The special verdict
or finding
must be filed with the
clerk and entered on
the journal.
� 276. When
the special finding
of facts
is inconsistent
with
the general verdict, the former controls
the latter, and
the court may give
judgment accordingly. 
� 277. When by the verdict
either party is entitled
to
recover
money
of
the
adverse
party,
the
jury
in their
ver- 
dict must assess the amount of recovery.

report
of
the
referees
upon
the
whole
issue,
stands
as
the
decision
of

may
be entered
thereon
in
the same
manner
as if
the
action
had
been
tried
by
the
court.
When
the reference
is
to report
the
facts,
the
report

which he is
a member, could

In such

COMPETENCY OF WITNESSES.
SEC. 310. Every
human
being of sufficient
capacity
to
understand
the obligation
of an oath,
is a competent
witness

in all cases, both civil and criminal, except as other-
wise herein
declared. But an Indian,
a negro, or mulatto
or
black person
shall
not be
allowed
to give
testimony
in
any
cause.
� 311. Facts
which have heretofore
caused the exclusion 
of testimony,
may
still be shown
for the
purpose of lessening

its credibility.
� 312.
A
person
who
has
a direct,
certain,
legal
interest
in the suit is not a competent
witness unless called
on for
that purpose
by
the opposite
party, as
hereafter
provided.
�
313.
The
husband
can
in
no
case
be
a
witness
against
the
wife, nor
the wife
against
the husband,
except in 
criminal proceeding
for
a crime
committed by
the one
against the
other, but they
may in all
criminal prosecutions
be
witnesses
for
each
other.
�
314.
Neither
husband
nor
wife
can
be
examined
in
any 
case as to any
communication
made
by the one to
the other
while married,
nor
shall
they, after
the
marriage
relation
ceases, be permitted
to
reveal in testimony,
any
such communication

made

while
the marriage
subsisted.
� 315.

attorney,
counselor,
physician,
sur-communicatIons
geon,
minister
of
the

be
allowed,
in giving
testimony,
to
disclose
any con-
fidential
communication,
property
intrusted
to
him
in his
professional
capacity,
and
necessary and
proper to
enable
him to discharge
the functions of
his office according to the
usual
course
of
practice
or
discipline.
� 316.
The
prohibitions
in the
prpceding
sections
do
not
apply
to
cases
where
the
party
in
whose
favor
the

ive provisions are
enacted waives the rights
thereby conferred.
� 317.
A public
officer
can not
be examined
as to communications

made

to him in official
confidence, when the
public
interests would suffer by the disclosure.
� 318.
A witness
is
not excused
from answering
a question

upon
the

mere

ground
that he would
be thereby
sub-
jected to
a civil liability.
� 319.
But when
the matter sought
to be elicited
would
tend
to
render
him
criminally
liable,
or
to expose
him
to
public
ignominy,
he
is not
compelled
to inswer,
except
as
provided in the next section.
� 320. A-
witness may be
interrogated
as to his previous
convictions
for
a felony.
But
no
other
proof
of
such
con-
viction is competent except the record thereof.
� 321.
When
part
of
an act,
declaration,
conversation,
or
'writing, is given in evidence by one party, the whole
on
the
same
subject
may
be
inquired
into
by
the
other;
thus,
when a letter is read,
all other letters on.
the same subject
between
the same parties
may be
given. And
when a detached

act,

declaration,

conversation,

or

writing,

is

given
in
evidence, any
other act,
declaration,
or writing,
which is
necessary
to
make it fully
understood,
or to explain
the
same, may
also be given
in evidencc.
� 322.
When
an
instrument
consists

latter,
where the tivo are intonsistent. 3

When
the
terms
of an agreement
have
been in-
ailrtiestopretended
in
a different
sense
by the
parties
to
it, that
sense
is to prevail
against
either party
in which he
had reason
to
suppose
the other
understood it.
� 324.
Historical
works,
books
of science
or
art, and
published

maps

or

charts,

when

a subscribing
witness
denies,
or
does
not
recollect
the
execution

name
is subscribed as such witness, its execution may be proved
by other
evidence.
� 326.
Evidence
respecting

by experts or by the jury
with writings
of the same persons,
which are proved to be genuine.

of
the transaction,
and
in
a
position
to
know
the
facts
therein
stated,
are
presumptive
evidence of such facts, when the entry was made against
the interest
of the person
so tnaking
it, or when
made in
a
professional
capacity, or in the
ordinary course of professional

conduct, or when made
in the performance of a duty
specially
enjoined
by law.
� 328, Books of account,
containing charges by one
party
against
the
other,
made
in
the
ordinary

of
busi.
ness, are
receivable in evidence
only under the following
circumstances,
subject to all just
exceptions as to their credibility.
1. The

the same book.
2. It
must be shown
by the
party's oath,
or otherwise,
that they
are his books
of original entries.
3. It must be shown
in like manner, that the

Were made at or near
the time of the transaction
therein
entered,
unless satisfactory
reasons
appear
for not making
such proof.
4. The charges must also be verified by the party or the
clerk who made the entries,
to the effect that
they believe
them just and true, or a sufficient reason must be given why
the verification is not made.

The
judge
of
the
court
is
a
competent
witness
for
either
party,
and
may
be sworn
upon
the
trial.
But
in such 
a
case
it
is
in
his
discretion
to
order
the
trial
to
be
post-
poned
or suspended,
and to
take place
before another

The
usual
protest
by
a
notary
public,
without
proof
of
his
signature
or
notarial
seal,
is
evidence
of the 
dishonor
and notice
of a bill
of exchange
or promissory
note.

in
a court
of
this
territory,
in
which
such
testimony
will,
as
he believes,
be
material,
and
the obstacles
preventing

the

immediate

commencement

of

the

CHAPTER
I.
JUI)GMENT
IN GENERAL.
SEC.
386.
A
judgment
is
the
final
determination
of the
rights of
the parties
in an action.
� 387. Judgment
may be given for or
against one or more
of several plaintifffs,
and
for or against
one or moreof
seve-
ral defendants; it may
determine the ultimate rights
of the
parties
on either side, as between
themselves, and
it may
grant to the
defendant
any affirmative
relief to
which he
may
be
entitled.
In
an
action
against
several
defendants,
the
court may,
in its discretion,
render
judgment against
one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against
the
others,
whenever
a several
judgment
may
be
proper.
The court may
also dismiss
the petition
with costs,
in favor
of one
or more
defendants,
in case
of unreasonable
neglect
on
the part of the plaintifff
to serve the summons on
other
defendants, or to proceed in the cause against the defendant,
or

defendants served.
� 388.
An
action
may
be
dismissed
without
prejudice
to a 
future
action. 
1. By the plaintifff
before the final submission of
the case
to
the jury, or to the court, where
the trial is by the court. 
2. By the court, where
the plaintifff fails
to appear on the
trial.
3. By the court for want of necessary parties.
4. By the court, on the application of some of the de-
fendants, where there are others whom the plaintifff fails to
,prosecute with diligence.
5. By the
court, for disobedience
by the plaintifff of
an
order concerning the
proceedings in the action.
In all
other cases, upon the trial
of the action, the decision
must
be upon the merits.
� 389.
In any case
where a
set-off or
counterclaim
has
been presented, the defendant shall have the right of proceeding

to the trial of his claim, although the plaintifff may
have dismissed the action, or failed to appear.
CHAPTER
II.
JUDGMENT UPON FAILURE TO ANSWER.
SEC. 390. If the taking of an account, or the proof of a 
fact,
or the
assessment
of
damages
be
necessary
to
enable 
the
court
to
pronounce
judgment
upon
a
failure
to answer,
or after a decision of an issue
of law, the court may, with 
the
assent
of
the
party
not
in
default,
take
the
account,
hear the proof, or assess the damages; or may, with the
like assent, refer the same to a referee or master commissioner,

or may
direct the same to be ascertained
or assessed
by a jury. If a jury be
ordered, it shall be on
or after the
day on which the action is set for trial.
CHAPTER III.
JUDGMENT
BY
CONFESSION.
SEC.
391.
Any
person
indebted,
or
against
whom
a
cause 
of action exists, may personally
appear, in a court of com- 
petent
jurisdiction,
and, with the assent
of the creditor,
or
person having
such cause
of action,
confess
judgment
therefore; whereupon
judgment
shall
be entered
accordingly.
� 392.
The
debt
or cause
of action
shall
be
briefly
stated
in
the
judgment, 
other
actions.
or
in
a
writing
to
be
filed
as
pleadings
in

for
its
enforcement,
as
judgments
rendered
in
actions
regu-
larly
brought
and
prosecuted;
and
the
confession
shall
operate as a
release of errors.
� 394. Every
attorney, who
shall confess judgment
in any
case,
shall,
at
the
time
of
making
such
confession,
produce
shallImkn
uhcofsin
rdc
the warrant
of attorney
for making
the same, to
the court
before
which
he makes
the confession,
and
the original,
or
a copy of
the warrant
shall
be
filed with
the clerk
of the
court in
which the
judgment
shall be
entered.

be in custody
in a
civil action,

the
suit
of another,

warrant
of
attorney

whose

suit

he

is

in

custody,

shall

be

of

any

named
by
the
person
in
custody,

and
sign
the
warrant
of attorney
as a
witness.
CHAPTER
IV.
MANNER
OF GIVING
AND ENTERING
JUDGMENT.
SEC. 396. When a trial by jury has been had, judgment
must
be
rendered
by the
clerk
in
conformity
to
the
verdict,
unless
it
is
special,
or
the
court
order
the
case
to
be
reserved

for
future argument
or consideration.
397.
Where
the
verdict
is
special,
or
where
there
has
been
a special
finding
on
particular
questions
of fact,
or
where
the court has ordered the case to be reserved, it shall
order what judgment shall be entered.
�
398.
Where,
upon
the
statements
in
the
pleadings,
one
party
is entitled
by
law to judgment
in his
favor, judgment
shall
be so
rendered
by the
court,
though
a verdict
has
been found against such party.
�
399.
If
a
counterclaim
or
set-off
established
at
the
trial,
exceeds
the
plaintifff's
claim
so
established,
judgment
for the
defendant
must
be
given
for the
excess;
or, if
it
appear
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
any
affirmative
re-
lief, judgment shall be given therefore.,
400.
It shall
not
be
necessary
to
reserve
in a judgment
or order,
the right
of an
infant
to show
cause against
it
after
his
attaining
full
age;
but
in
any
case
in
which,
but
for
this
section,
such
reservation
would
have
been
proper,
the infant within
one year after arriving
at the age of
twenty-one
years,
may
show
cause
against
such order
or
judgment.
401.
All judgments
and orders must
be entered
on the
journal
of the court,
and
specify
clearly the
relief
granted 
or
order
made
in
the
action. 
� 402. The
clerk shall make a complete
record of every
cause,
as
soon
as
it
is
finally
determined;
unless
such
re- 
cord
or some
part thereof
be
duly waived.
� 403.
He
shall make
up such
record
in each
cause,
in the
vacation
next after
the
tern at
which
the same
was de- 
termined; and the
presiding judge of such
court shall, at
its
next
term
thereafter,
subscribe
the
same. 
� 404. The records shall be made up from the petition, the
process,
return,
the pleadings
subsequent
thereto,
reports, 
verdicts,
orders, judgments, and
all material acts and proceedings

of

the court; but if the
items of an account
or
the
copies
of a paper
attached
to the pleadings
be volumi-
nous,
the court may order the
record to be made by abbre-viated.
viating
the same, or inserting
a pertinent description
thereof,
or by omitting them
entirely. Evidence must
not
be recorded.
� 405. When
the judicial acts
or other proceedings
of any
court
have
not
been
regularly
brought
up and
recorded
by 
the clerk thereof, such court shall cause the same to be
made up and recorded within such time as it may direct.
When they are made up, and upon examination found to be
correct, the presiding judge of such court shall subscribe
the same.
� 406.
No
complete
record
shall
be
made
1. In criminal
prosecutions
where
the indictment
has 
been quashed,
or where the prosecuting
attorney shall have
entered
a iolle prosequi,
on the indictment.
2. In cases
where ail action has
been dismissed without
prejudice
to a future
action.
3. In actions in
which, in open court,
at the term at
which the final order
or judgment shall be
made, both parties

shall declare
their agreement that no
record shall be
made.
� 407.
In cases where an action
has been dismissed
without
prejudice to
a future action,
the clerk shall
make a
complete
record
of
the
proceedings,
upon
being
paid
for 
making
the same by the party
desiring the record
to be
made.
� 408. A
complete
record
shall
be made
in the
case mentioned

in section
three
hundred and
eighty-nine,
unless
waived by the parties.

can not be served upon
them, or that the names
and residence of the

him;
and
it

and
shall
be
liable
to

and
sold
as
hereinafter

provided.
�
435.
The
lands
and
tenements
of
the
debtor
within
the
county where
the judgment
is entered, shall
be bound for
the
satisfaction
thereof,
from
the
first
day
of
the
term
at
which
judgment
is
rendered;
but
judgments
by
confession,
and judgments
rendered
at the same
term at
which the
action is.commenced,
shall
bind such
lands only
from the
day on which
such judgments
are

All other
lands, as well
as goods and chattels
of the debtor, shall be
bound
from
the time
they shall
be
seized
in execution.
�
436.
If

shall
not
be

out
within
five
years
from
the
date
of any
judgment,
that
now is
or may
hereafter
be rendered
in
any court
of

such
judgment

judgment
shall
become
dormant,
and shall
cease
to operate
as
a lien on the estate
of the judgment debtor.

The
writ
of
execution
against
the
property
of
the
judgment debtor, issuing from any court of record in this
territory,
shall
command
the
officer
to whom
it'is directed,
that
of
the
goods
and
chattels
of
the
debtor,
he cause
to
be
made
the money
specified
in
the writ;
and
for want
of
goods
and chattels,
he cause
the same

made of
the
lands
and tenements
of the debtor;
and

exact amount
of the

damages
and
costs,
for
which
the judgment

or more writs of execution
against the 
same
debtor

be
sued
out

which 
judgment
was
rendered,
or within
ten days
thereafter,
and
when
two
or
more
writs
of
execution
against
the
same
debtor
shall
be delivered
to the
officer
on the
same
day,
no
preference
shall
be given
to
either of
such writs;
but
if a
sufficient
sum of money
be not
made to satisfy
all execu-
tions,
the amount
made
shall
be distributed
to
the several
creditors
in proportion
to the
amount of
their respective
demands.
In
all
other
cases,
the
writ
of
execution
first 
delivered
to the officer
shall be first satisfied.
And it shall
be the
duty of the
officer to indorse
on every
writ of execu-
tion the
time when
he received
the
same;
but nothing
herein
ocntained
shall be
so construed
as to
affect any
preferable 
lien,
which
one
or
more
of the
judgments,
on
which
execu-
tion issued,
may
have
on the
lands

I
db439.
The
officer
to
whom
a
writ
of
execution
is
deli- 
vered shall proceed,
immediately,
to levy the
same upon the
goods
and
chattels
of
the
debtor;
but
if
no
goods
and 
chattels can
be found,
the officer
shall
indorse
on the writ
of
execution
" no
goods,"
and forthwith
levy
the
writ of
execution
upon
the
lands
and
tenements
of
the
debtor,
which
may be liable to satisfy
the judgment.
�
440. If the
officer,
by virtue
of any writ
of execution,
issued
from
any
court
of
record
in
this
territory,
shall
levy 
the
same
on
any
goods
and
chattels
claimed
by
any
person
other than the defendant, it shall be the duty of said officer 
forthwith
to
give
notice
in
writing
to
some
justice
of
the
peace in
the county, in which shall
be set forth the names
of the plaintifff and defendAnt, together with the name of
the
claimant; and at the same
time he shall furnish
the
said justice of the peace with a schedule of the property
claimed.
And it
shall be the
duty of such
justice
of the
peace, immediately upon the receipt of such notice and
schedule,
to
make
an
entry
of
the
same
upon
his
docket,
and issue
a writ of summons, directed
to the sheriff, or any
constable of the county,
commanding him to summon
five
disinterested
men,
having
the
qualifications
of
electors,
who
shall
be
named
in
said
summons,
to
appear
before
him,
the
said
justice,
at
the
time
and
place
therein
mentioned,
which time shall not be
more than three days after
the date
of said
writ, to try
and determine
the right
of the claimant
to the property in controversy. And it shall be the duty
of the claimant to give
two days' notice, in writing,
to the
plaintifff
or other
party for
whose benefit
such execution
was issued and
levied as aforesaid,
his agent or attorney,
if within
the county,
of the
time and
place of such
trial;
and he shall,
moreover, prove to the
satisfaction of said
justice that
such notice was given, or
that the same could
not be
given by reason
of the
absence of
the party,
his
agent
or attorney.
�
441.
The
jury
summoned
as
aforesaid,
shall
be
sworn
to try and determine
the right of the
claimant to the pro-
perty in controversy,
and a true verdict
to give, according
to the evidence. If the jury shall find the right to said
goods and chattels, or any part thereof, to be in the claimant,

they

shall also find the
value thereof, and the
justice
shall
render judgment upon
such finding of the jury,
for
the
claimant, that he recover
his c6sts against the plaintifff
in
execution, or other party
to the same, for whose
benefit
the execution issued, and also that he have restitution of
said
goods and
chattels, or
any part thereof,
according
to
the
finding of
the jury. But
if the right
of the said
good;
and
chattels,
and
every part
thereof,
shall
uiot be
in the
claimant
according.
to the
finding of
said jury,
then the
said
justice shall
render judgment
on such
finding,
in favor
of
the plaintifff
in execution,
or other party
for whose
benefit

the

same, was
issued and
levied, against
said
claimant
for
costs,
and
award
execution
thereon.
Said
justice
of
the
peace,
in the taxation
of costs
accruing
by reason
of such
claim
and
trial
shall
allow
each
juror
summoned
and
sworn,
the
sum
of
fifty
cents;
and
for
the
sheriff,
constable,
or
other
officer,
and
witnesses,
and
for
himself,
he
shall
tax
such
fees
as are
allowed
by
law,
to each,
respectively,
for
like
services
rendered
in other
cases.
Such
judgment
for
the
claimant,
(unless
an
undertaking
shall
be
executed,
as
provided
in
the next
section)
shall
be
a justification
of
the
officer
in
returning
"no
goods"
to
the
writ
of
execution,
by
virtue
of
which
the
levy
has
been
made,
as
to
such
part
of
the
goods
and
chattels,
as
were
found
to
belong
to
such
claimant.
� 442. If
the jury shall
find the property
or any
part
thereof
to
be
in
the
claimant,
and
the
plaintifff
in
execution,
shall,
at any
time
within
three
days
after
such
trial,
tender
to
the
sheriff
or
other
officer
having
such
property
in
his
custody
on
execution,
an
undertaking
with
good
and
sufficient

sureties,

payable

to
such
claimant,
in
double
the
amount
of
the
value
of
such
property
as
assessed
by
the
jury, to the effect that they will pay all damages sustained
by
reason
of
the
detention
or
sale
of
such
property,
then
the
sheriff
or
other
officer
shall
deliver
said
undertaking
to
claimant,
and
proceed
to
sell
such
property,
as
if
no
such
trial
of
the
right
of
property
had
taken
place,
and
shall
not
be liable to the
claimant therefore.
443.
In
all
cases
where
a
sheriff,
coroner,
or
other
offi-
cer, shall by
virtue of an execution,
levy upon any goods 
and chattels which
shall remain
upon his hands unsold,
for 
.want
of
bidders,
for
the
want
of
time
to
advertise
and
sell,
or any
other
reasonable
cause,
the officer
may
for
his
own
security,
take of
the defendant
an
undertaking
with
security
in such sum as
he may deem
sufficient, to
the effect, that 
the
said
property
shall
be
delivered
to
the
officer
holding
an execution
for the
sale
of the
same,
at the
time
and place
appointed
by said
officer,
either
by notice
given
in writing
to said defendant
in execution,
or by
advertisement,
published

in
a newspaper
printed
in
the county,
naming
therein
the
day
and
place
of .sale.
If the
defendant
shall fail
to deliver
the goods
and chat- 
tels
at
the
time
and
place
mentioned
in
the

such
case,
restitution shall be made by the judgment creditor of the
monies, for which such lands or tenements were sold, with

on motion in court and two days' notice thereof in writing,
be amerced in the amount of said debt, damages and costs,
with ten per centum thereon, to and for the use of said
plaintifff or defendant,
as the case
may be.

or
attorney
of
record,
to
pay
over
all

such clerk may be amerced; and the proceedings against
him and his sureties, shall be the same as provided for in the
foregoing section against sheriffs and their sureties.

as
aforesaid,
the
said
sheriff
or 
other officer shall not be amerced in a greater sum than the
amount so withheld, with ten per centum thereon.

this territory, and
directed to the sheriff or coroner of an- 
other
county, it shall be
lawful for such sheriff
or coroner

after
having
discharged
all the
duties
required
of
him
by
law,
to
inclose
such
execution,
by
mail,
to the clerk of the court who issued the same. On proof
being made
by such sheriff or coroner,
that the execution
was mailed
soon enough to have
reached the office where
it
was issued, within the time prescribed by law, the sheriff
or coroner
shall not be liable for
any amercement or penalty,

if it do not reach the office in due time.

to do it by the
plaintifff, his agent
or attorney of
record.
In all
cases of a
motion to
amerce a sheriff
or 
other officer of
any county other
than the one from
which

of
the
court,
and
shall
have
the
same
force
and

CHAPTER
II.
PROCEEDINGS
IN
AID
OF EXECUTION.
� 472.
When a judgment
debtor
has not
personal or
real
property
subject
to levy
on execution,
sufficient
to satisfy
the
judgment,
any
interest
which
he may
have
in
any
bank-
ing,
turnpike,
bridge
or other
joint
stock
company,
or
any
interest
he may
have
in any
-money
contracts,
claims
or
choses
in action
due
or to
become
due to
him,
or in any
judgment
or decree;
or any
money, goods
or effects
which
he
may
have
in possession
of any
person,
body
politic
or
corporate,
shall
be
subject
to the
payment
of
such judgment

by

proceedings

in

equity,

or

as
in
this
chapter
pre-
scribed.
�
473.
When
an
execution
against
the
property
<of
a
judgment
debtor,
or one of several
debtors
in the same
ofjudgment,
is issued
to the
sheriff of
a county
where he.
resides, or if
he do not reside in the territory,
to the
sheriff
of
the. county
where
the judgment
was
rendered,
or
a
transcript
of a
justice's
judgment
has
been
filed,
is
returned
unsatisfied
in whole
or in
part,
the judgment
creditor
is
entitled
-to
an order
from
a county
judge
or a
fudge
of the
district
court
of the
county
to which
the
execution

was

issued,
requiring
such
debtor
to
appear
and
answer
concerning
his property,
before
such
judge,
or
a referee
appointed
by
such
judge,
at
a time
and
place
specified
in such
order,
within
the
county
to
which
the execution

wus

issued.
� 474.
After
the
issuing
of
an
execution
against
property,
and upon
proof
by affidavit
of
the judgment
creditor
or
otherwise,
to thesatisfaction
of the
district
court,
or a judge
thereof,
or
a county
jugde
of the
county
in which
the
order
may be
served,
that
the judgment
debtor
has
property
which
he unjustly
refuses
to
apply
towards
the satisfaction
of the
judgment,
such court
or
judge
may, by
order,
require
the judgment debtor to
appear at a time and place
in said
county to answer concerning
the same. And such
proceedings

may thereupon be
had for the application
of the property

of the judgment
debtor towards the satisfaction
of
the judgment
as are prescribed
in this chapter.
� 475. Instead
of the order requiring
the attendance
of 
the
judgment
debtor,
as
provided
in
the
last
two
sections,
the judge may,
upon proof to his satisfaction,
by affidavit
of the
party, or
otherwise, that
there is
danger of
the
debtor
leaving the territory
or concealing himself to
avoid
the
examination herein mentioned,
issue a warrant
requiring

the

sheriff to arrest him
and bring him before
such
judge within the county in which the debtor may be
arrested. Such warrant can be issued only by a county
judge, or a judge of the district court of the county in
which
such
debtor
resides
or
maybe
arrested.
Upon
being 
brought
before
the
judge,
he
shall
be
examined
on
oath,
and
other witnesses may be
examined on either side,
and
if
on such examination it
appear that there is danger
of
the debtor
leaving the territory,
and that he has property

which

he

unjustly

refuses

to

apply

to

such

judgment,
lie may be ordered
te enter into an undertaking
in such
sum
as
the
judge
may
prescribe,
with
one
or
more
sureties 
that he will
from time to time attend
for examination
before the
judge or referee as shall
be directed. In default
of entering into
such undertaking, he may be committed
to the jail
of the county by warrant
of the judge, as for
a
contempt.
�
476. No
person
shall,
on
examination
pursuant
to this
chapter,
be
excused
from
answering
any
question
on the 
ground
that
his
examination
will
tend
to
convict
him
of
a
fraud,
but his answer
shall not
be used as
evidence against
him in
a prosecution
for such fraud.
�
477. After
the issuing
of execution
against
property,
any
person indebted
to
the judgment
debtor,
may pay
to 
to
the
sheriff
the
amount
of
his
debt,
or
so
much
thereof
as
may
be necessary
to satisfy
the execution,
and the sheriffs
receipt
shall
be
a sufficient
discharge
for
the
amount
so
paid,
or directed
to be credited by the
judgment creditor on the
execution.
� 478. After the issuing, or return of an execution against 
property of
the judgment debtor,
or of any one
of several 
Cmen 
debtors in the
same judgment, and
upon proof by affidavit
or otherwise,
to the
satisfaction
of the judge,
that
any per-Igo 
son,
or corporation,
has
property
of
such
judgment
debtor,
or
is indebted to him, the judge
may, by an order,
require
such person, or corporation, or any officer or member there-
of,
to appear, at a specified
time and place, within
the
county in which such person or corporation may be served
with the
order to answer, and answer
concerning the same.
The judge may also, in his discretion, require notice of such
proceeding to be given to any party in the action, in such
manner as may seem to him proper.
�
479.
Witnesses
may
be
required
upon
the
order
of
the
judge,
or by
a subptena
issued
by the
clerk
of
the
district
court, to appear
and testify upon any proceedings
under
this chapter, in the
same manner as upon
the trial of an
issue.
� 480.
The
party
or
witness
may
be
required
to
attend
before
the judge,
or before
a referee, appointed
by the
court
or judge. If before a referee, the examination must. be
taken by the referee and certified by the judge. All examinations

and answers before a judge or referee, under
this chapter, must be on oath, but when a corporation answers,

the answer
must be on the oath
of an officer
thereof.
� 481.
The
judge
may
order
any
property
of
the judgment

debtor, not
exempt by law, in the
hands of either
himself or any other
person, or corporation,
or due to the
judgment debtor,
to be applied towards the
satisfaction of
the judgment; but
the earnings of the debtor
for his personal

services, at any time within three months next preceding

the order,
can not be so applied, where
it is made to
appear by the debtor's
affidavit, or otherwise,
that such
earnings are necessary
for the use of a
family supported
wholly or
partly by his
labor.
� 482.
The
judge
may
also,
by order,
appoint
the
sheriff
of the proper county, or 6ther suitable person, a receiver
of the property of
the judgment debtor, in
the same manner,

and with the like authority, as if the appointment was
made by the court.
The judge may also,
by order, forbid
a transfer or other
disposition of the property of the judgincut

debtor, not
exempt by law, and
any interference
therewith.
�
483.
If
the
sheriff
shall
be
appointed
receiver,
he
and
his sureties
shall be liable on his official
bond for the faith-
ful discharge of his duties as such receiver; if any other
person shall be appointed
receiver, he shall
give a written
undertaking, in such
sum as shall be prescribed
by the
judge,
with
one
or
more
sureties,
to
the
effect
that
he
will
faithfully discharge
his duties of receiver,
and lie shall also
take an oath to the
same effect, before acting
as such receiver.

The undertaking
mentioned in this
section shall be
to the Territory of
Nebraska, and actions
may be prosecuted

for a breach thereof, by any person interested, in the
same manner
as upon a sheriff's
official bond.
� 484.
The
judge,
or
referee,
acting
under
the
provisions
of this chapter,
shall have
power to continue
his proceed-
ings
from
time
to
time,
until
they
are
completed.

The judge
may, in his
discretion,
order a reference
to a referee
agreed
upon or appointed
by
him, to report
theJudge.

of the
facts.

party or witness, disobey
an order
of the judge or
referee, duly served,
such person,
party or 
witness
may
be
punished
by the
judge
as for
contempt.
� 487.
The
orders
to
judgment
debtors
and
witnesses,
provided for
in this chapter,
shall be in writing
and signed 
by the judge
making the same,
and shall
be served as
summons
in
other cases.
The
judge
shall reduce
all
his
orders to
writing,
which,
together
with
a minute
of his
proceedings
signed by
himself,
shall
be filed with
the
clerk
of the
court
of the county
in
which
the judgment
is
rendered,

or

the
transcript
of the

of
filing
the
same.

sheriffs,
referees,
receivers
and
witnesses,

compensation
as

thereof
from
such
party

parties
as ought
to
pay
the
same.

The
county
judge
shall
be
allowed
for
his
services,
under this chapter,
the sum of three dollars
in each case, 
and such
fees as

ment
for
part

to be confessed,
such
plaintifff shall pay all
the costs of the defendant

amount, and of the time
and
place
of making it, as the court
shall deem reasonable,
do,
not attend to accept the
confession, or attending,
refuse to
accept
it, and should afterwards
commence an action
upon
such cause, and not recover
more than the amount
so offered
to
be confessed, he shall
pay all the costs
of the action; and
on the trial thereof, the offer shall not be deemed to be an

at the
suit of any
person entitled
to pro-
tect
or enjoy
the
property
aforesaid.
� 577.
Nothing
herein
contained
authorizes
the recovery
of
more than
the just
value
of the
timber
taken from
uncultivated

wood
land for
the repair
of a public highway
or
bridge, upon
the land
in its immediate
neighborhood.
�
578.
The
owner
of
an
estate
in
remainder
or
reversion,
may
maintain
either
of the aforesaid
actions
for
injuries
done
to
the
inheritance,
notwithstanding
any
intervening
estate
for
life
or
years.
�
579.
An
heir,
whether
a
minor
or
of
full
age,
may
maintain

these

actions

for

injuries
done
in
the time
of his
ances-
tors as well
as in his own
time, unless
barred by
the statute
of limitations.
580.
Where
lands
or-tenements
are
sold
by
virtue
of
an
execution,
the purchaser
at such
sale
may maintain
his
action against
any person, for either
of the causes above
mentioned,
occurring
or existing
after his
purchase.
� 581.
This provision is not
intended to prevent the
per-
o son who
occupies
the
lands,
in the
mean
time,
from using
them in
the ordinary course of
husbandry, or for using
timber
for
the purpose
of making
suitable
repairs
thereon.
� 582.
But
if
for this
purpose
he employ
timber
vastly
superior to
that required
for this occasion,
he will
be deemed
to have committed
waste,
and will
be liable accordingly.
CHAPTER
II.
ACTIONS
ON
OFFICIAL
SECURITIES.
SEC.
583. When
an
officer,
executor
or
administrator
within
this
territory,
by
misconduct
or
neglect
of
duty, 
forfeits
his bond or
renders his
sureties liable,
any person
injured
thereby, or
who is by law
entitled to
the benefit
of
the
security,
may
bring
an
action
thereon,
in
his
own
name,
against
the officer, executor
or administrator, and his
sureties,

to

recover

the

amount

to

which

he

may

be

entitled

by
reason
of
the
delinquency.
The
action
may
be
instituted
and
proceeded in on a certified
copy of the bond,
which
copy shall
be furnished
by the
person holding
the original
thereof.
� 584.
A
judgment
in
favor
of a party
for
one
delinquency, 
does
not preclude
the same
or another
party from an
action
on the
same security
for
another
delinquency.
CHAPTER
III.
ACTIONS
FOR
THE PARTITION
OF REAL
PROPERTY.
SEC.
585. The
provisions
of the
existing statutes
relating 
to
the
partition
of
lands,
tenements
and
hereditam'ents,
are 
not affected
by
this code,
and
partition
may be
made
under
the
same,
as heretofore,
until
the
legislature
shall
otherwise
provide. The
provisions
of such statutes,
shall
also apply
to actions
for such
partition
brought
under
this
act, so far
*as
the same
can be
so applied
to the
substance
and
subject
matter
of the
action
without
regard
to its
form.
CHAPTER IV.
PROCEEDINGS
UPON
MANDAMUS.
SEC.
586.
The
writ
of mandamus
may
be
issued
to
anyTowhom
inferior
tribunal,
corporation,
board
or
person,
to
compel 
the performance
of
an act, which
the law specially
enjoins
as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station. But
though it may
require'an
inferior tribunal
to exercise
its
judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions,

it can not control judicial discretion.
�
587.
This
writ
may
not
be
issued
in
any
case,
where
there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of the
law. It may issue on the
information of the
party benefically
interested.
�
588. The
writ is either
alternative
or peremptory.
The
alternative
writ
must
state
concisely
the
facts
showing
the
obligation
of
the
defendant
to
perform
the
act,
and.his
omission

to
perform

it,
and command
him, that
immediately
upon
the receipt of the writ,
or at some other specified
time, he
do the act required to
be performed, or show cause
before
the
court whence
the writ issued,
at a
specified time
and
place, why
he has not done
so; and
that he, then
anDd there
return the writ,
with his
certificate
of having done
as he is
commanded.
The peremptory
writ
must be in
a similar
form, except
that the words
requiring
the defendant
to show
cause
why
he has not
done
as commanded,
must
be omitted.
� 589.
When
the
right
to
require
the
performance
of
the
act is clear, -and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be
given for not performing
it, a peremptory mandamus
may be
allowed
in
the first
instance.
In all
other
cases, the
alter-
native
writ
must
be first
issued.
�
590.
The
motion,
for
the
writ
must
be
made
upon
affidavit,

and

the court
may require
a notice of
the application
to
be given
to the
adverse party,
or may grant
an order
to
show cause why it should
not be allowed, or may
grant the
writ without notice.
� 591.
The allowance
of the
writ must
be
indorsed
thereon,

signed

by

a
judge

of
the

court

granting

it,

and

the

writ
must be served personally upon the defendant. If the defendant

duly served neglect to return the same, he shall be
proceeded against, as for a contempt.
� 592.
On
the return
day of
the
alternative
writ,
or
such
further day, as the court may allow, the party on whom
the writ shall have been served, may show cause, by answer

made, in the same manner as an answer to a petition
in a civil action.
b
593.
If
no
answer
be
made,
a peremptory
mandamus
must
be
allowed against the defendant.
If an answer be made
containing
new
matter,
the
same
shall
not
in
any
respect,
conclude the plaintifff, who may on the trial or other proceeding,

avail

himself of any
valid objection to its
suffici-
ency, or may countervail it by proof, either in direct denial
or by way
of avoidance.
� 594.
No
other
pleading
or written
allegation
is
allowed,

than

the

writ

and

answer.

These

are

the

pleadings

in
the case, and
have the
same effect
and are to be
construed
and may be amended
in the
same manner, as
pleadings
in
a civil
action;
and
the
issues
thereby
joined
must
be
tried,
and
the
further
proceedings
thereon
had
in the
same
man-
ner, as in
a civil action.
� 595.
If judgment be given for
the plaintifff, he shall re- 
cover
the
damages
which
he
shall
have
sustained,
to
be
as-
certained
by the
court,
or a
jury,
or by
referees,
in
a civil
action,
and
costs;
and
a peremptory
mandamus
shall
alo
be granted
to him
without
delay.
� 596. A recovery of damages by virtue of this chapter,
against
a party, who shall
have made a return to a
writ of
mandamus,
is
a bar to any
other action
against the
same
party for the making of such return.
� 597. Whenever a peremptory mandamus is directed to
any
public
officer,
body
or
board,
commanding
the
perform-maybeinposed.
ance
of
any public
duty,
specially
enjoined
by
law, if it
appear
to the
court, that
such
officer, or
any member
of
such
body
or board,
has, without
just excuse,
refused or
neglected

to perform
the duty
so enjoined,
the court may
impose
a
fine not exceeding
five hundred dollars,
upon every such
officer, or
member of
such body or
board. Such
fine, when
collected,
shall
be
paid
into
the
treasury
of
the
county,
where the
duty ought to have been
performed; and the payment

thereof

is
a bar to an action
for any
penalty incurred
by such officer,
or member
of such
body or board,
by reason
of hM refusal
or
neglect to
perform
the duty
so enjoined.

to
be
done
by
him,
may

same effect.
� 613. The time within
which an act is to be done
as
herein
provided,
shall
be
computed
by
excluding
the
first

code,
shall 
have the
right to require
the person
offered as surety,
to make
an affidavit of his qualifications, which affidavit may be made

into
effect the provisions
of this code; and
they shall make such
further
rules
consistent
therewith,
as they
may
deem
proper.

The

rules

so
made

shall

hereafter

rendered

to

the

CHAPTER VI.
PROVISIONS AS
TO THE OPERATION
OF THE CODE.
SEC.

619: Rights
of civil action
given, or secured
by existing

laws,

shall

be

prosecuted

in

the

manner

provided

by
en-]sngintepodd
this
code, except
as provided
in
section
six hundred
and
twenty.
If
a
case
ever
arise,
in
which
an
action
for
the
enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention

of a wrong,
can not be had under
this code, the
practice
heretofore
in use,
may be adopted,
so far
as may
be necessary to prevent a failure of justice.
�
620. Until
the legislature
shall
otherwise
provide,
this
code
shall
not
affect
proceedings
on
habeas
corpus,
quo
warranto,
or
to
assess
damages
for
private
property
taken
for public
uses;
nor proceedings
under
the statutes
for
the
settlement
of estates
of decased
persons; nor
proceedings
under statutes
relating
to dower,
divorce, or alimony;
or to
establish, or set aside a will; nor proceedings under statutes

relating to apprentices, arbitration, bastardy, insol-
vent debtors; nor
any special statutory remedy
not heretofore
obtained

by action; but such proceedings may be prosecuted

under the code, whenever it is applicable.
� � 621.
Where,
by
statute,
a civil
action,
legal
or equita-
ble,
is
given,
and
the
mode
of
proceeding
therein
is
pre-
scribed,
this code
shall
not
affect the
proceedings
under
such
statute,
until
the
legislature
shall
otherwise
provide;
but
in all
such
cases,
as
far
as it
may
be
consistent
with
the
statute
giving
such
action,
and
practicable
under
this
code, the proceedings
shall be conducted in conformity
thereto. Where the statute designates by name or otherwise,

the kind
of action, but does not
prescribe the mode
of proceeding therein, such action shall be commenced and
prosecuted in
conformity to this code;
where the statute
gives
an action, but
does not designate
the
kind of action,
or prescribe
the mode
of proceeding
therein,
such action
shall be
held to be
the civil action
of this
code, and proceeded

in accordingly.
