§ 4952. Justification of sureties. A court, or an
officer, authorized by law to approve a surety, may re
quire such person to testify, orally or in writing, touch
ing his sufficiency; but this shall not, in itself, exonerate
the officer in an action for taking insufficient surety.

has not abolished legal or equitable rights, 15 O.S.415; 2W. L.
M. 125. Its leading object is to avoid circuity and multiplicity
of suits, 20 O. S. 38, 54 ; 14 O. S. 302, 306 ; and the court is to be re
garded as a court of law or equity, and the petition a declaration

by a jury, and final judgment can not be rendered on demurrer
to an answer, 14 O. S. 157.
§4974. To what cases this chapter dces not apply.
This chapter shall not apply to actions already com
menced (1), nor to cases wherein the right of action has
already accrued (2); but the statutes in force when the
action accrued shall be applicable to such cases, accord
ing to the subject of the action, and without regard to
the form ; nor shall this chapter apply in the case of a
continuing and subsisting trust (3), nor to an action by

between trustee and cestui que trust that lapse of time does not
constitute a bar, 1O. S. 478, 507 ; 28 O. S. 568, 579 ; 38 O. S. 96. A devise by testator of all his real estate to his son, he to pay tes
tator's daughter a legacy in annual installments, does not create
a continuing and subsisting trust, 40 O. S. 27; 11 Bull 248; see
also 21 Bull 357 ; 46 O. S. . Trustees of a township holding title
to lands granted to them by the general government for school fmrposes are not exempt from the operation of the statute of
imitations in an action prosecuted by them to recover posses
sion of the premises, 38 O. S. 87; hut where the trustee, with
knowledge of the cestui que trust, disclaims the trust, either ex
pressly or by acts necessarily implying a disclaimer, lapse of
time may be relied on as a defense, 1 O. S. 507 ; see 35 O. S. 317
§ 4975. What causes of action survive. In addition
to the causes of action which survive at common law,
causes of action for mesne profits, or for an injury to

action does not abate it, 1 Clev. R. 122 ; see § 5144.
§ 4976. Special limitations saved. Civil actions can
only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this
chapter, after the cause of action accrues; but where a
different limitation is prescribed by statute, that shall
govern. [51 v. 57, \ 8 ; S. & V. 943.]

SUBDIVISION II. ACTIONS CONCERNING! EEAL PROPERTY.
§ 4977. Actions to recover real estate limited to
twenty-one years. An action for the recovery of the
title or possession of real property can only be brought
within twenty-one years after the cause of such action
accrues, and whenever any of the streets or alleys or any
part or parts thereof lain [laid] out and shown on the
recorded plat or plats of any cities or villages in the
state of Ohio, shall not have been opened to the public
use and occupancy of the citizens of said cities or vil
lages, or other person or persons, and said streets or
parts thereof not opened to public use as aforesaid shall
have been enclosed by a fence by the owner or owners of
the inlot or lots [or] outlots lying on, adjacent to, or
Virginia military lands held under lease for ninety-nine years,
renewable forever, 9 O. S. 489. There is no presumption of a
grant of lands from mere possession short of twenty-one years,
5 O. 455. The statute does not run in favor of a tenant in com
mon in occupancy of the premises against his co-tenant until
some overt act of an unequivocal character clearly indicating an
assertion of ownership of the entire premises to the exclusion of
the right of the co-tenant, 36 O. S. 232; and it does not run
against the heirs of the wife until the termination of the hus
band's life estate in her lands as tenant by the curtesy, 36
O. S. 584.
§ 4978. Saving to persons under disability. If a per
son entitled to bring the action mentioned in § 4977 is,
at the time the cause of action accrues, within the age
of minority, of unsound mind, or imprisoned, such per
son may, after the expiration of twenty-one years from
the time the cause of action accrues, bring such action
within ten years after such disability is removed. [83
v. 74 ; 51 v. 57, § 10 ; S. & C. 945.]
See \\ 3136, 4986. Before the last amendment of this section, 83 v.
74, a married woman came within its saving clause, and her dis
ability, it was held, was not removed by the acts conferring upon
her separate property rights, 40 O. S. 603 ; 43 O. S. 386. In case of a
female the disability is removed at the age of eighteen, 3O.S. 80; so
that twenty-one years is to be read eighteen in the statute in such
case, Yaple's Code, etc., p. 427. The disabilities extend only to
those existing when the cause of action accrues, 30 O. S. 491 ;
and when the statute begins to run, it continues to run without
interruption fromany subsequentdisability, 13 O. 181, 196; 20 O.
250 ; 1 O. S. 478 ; 38 O. S. 374. When it begins to run against an
ancestor it continues to run against the heir, though an infant, 1
O. S. 478. On the other hand, the heir or grantee of one pro
tected from the operation of the statute is entitled to its pro
tection. 4 O. S. 464; 13 O. 181; and where the interests of two
defendants are joint and inseparable, and the rights of one are
saved, such saving inures to the benefit of the other, 1 O. S. 544 ;
13 O. S. 431 ; 20 O. S. 208 ; 24 O. S. 572; but where the rights of
each are severable the protection of the statute extends only to
those within its provisions, 10 O. 11, as in case of co-parceners
or tenants in common. 10 O. 135; 1 O. S. 478; 10 O. 11 ; but in
a proceeding in error, if one of the parties is within the saving
clause, the case is saved as to all, 3 O. 49 ; 12 O. 351 ; 21 O. S. 131 ; 17
O. 27. Where the right or estate of children does not accrue
until the death of a tenant for life, the statute does not begin to
run against them until after his death, 17 O. S. 374.

against a cestui que trust until he has knowledge of the trust, 10
O. S. 198 ; nor against an infant for the wrong of his guardian ad
iitonHntil the discovery of the wrong, 17 O. S. 485 ; and in a pro
ceeding to reform an instrument on the ground of mistake, lapse
of time is reckoned only from discovery of mistake, 11 O. S. 653.
Under theact of 1831, and under the code prior to 1867, fraudulent
concealment of the cause of action did not prevent the running
of the statute, 4 O. 331 ; 10 O. 4G9: 6 O. S. 276 ; 19 O. S. 462. An
action for specific performance against the heirs of the vendor
and his grantee who took the legal estate with notice is not an
action for relief on the ground of fraud within the meaning of
this section, 31 O. S. 188. Fraudulent conveyance, 21 Bull 212.
§ 4983. Within one year. An action for libel, slan
der, assault, battery, malicious prosecution, or false im
prisonment. An action upon a statute for a penalty or
forfeiture ; but where a different limitation is prescribed
in the statute by which the remedy is given,- the action
may be brought within the period so limited. [51 v. 57,
§ 16 ; S. & C. 949.]
An action to recover money lost or paid on a bet or wager is
an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, 29 O. S. 547.
An action against a county treasurer on his bond to enforce the
statutory liability is subject to the limitation in § 4984, 32 O. S. 421.
§ 4984. Actions on official and other bonds. An action
upon the official bond or undertaking of an officer (1), as
signee, trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian, or
upon a bond or undertaking given in pursuance of a
statute, can only be brought within ten years after the
cause of action accrues; but this section shall be sub
ject to the qualification in § 4976. [51 v. 57, § 17 ; S. &
C. 949.]
1. 16 O.S.80,522; 32 O.S.421. An action against an officer not
on his official bond is barred in six years, 21 O. S. 643. An action
against a sheriff for not paying over money does not accrue
until demand, 22 O. S. 27.
§ 4985. Ten years. Other relief. An action for relief
not hereinbefore provided for can only be brought within ten years after the cause of action accrues. [51 v. 57,
§ 18; S. & C. 949.]
Actions by and against companies and partners (S. & S. 1139)
are within the provisions ot thus section, 40 O. S. 37, and actions
to charge the separate estate oi a married woman upon her
verbal promise, 9 Bull 63, 61 (C. S. C. 1883). The section is not
applicable to an action against an officer not on his official bond,
21 O. S. 643, nor to an action brought on a judgment rendered in
another state, 33 O. S. 52, nor to an action by a surety for contribuaon, 16 O. S. 552; see i v. ^. R. 210, 228.
§ 4986. Bights saved to certain persons. If a person
entitled to bring any action mentioned in this subdivis
ion, except for a penalty or forfeiture, is, at the time the
cause of action accrues, within the age of minority, of
unsound mind, or imprisoned, such person may bring
such action within the respective times limited by this
subdivision, after such disability is removed. [83 v. 74 ;
80 v. 77 ; 51 v. 57, § 19; S. & C. 949.]
See 3136, 4978. The statute is personal and can not be
extended to any party not within its saving, 10 O. 135. A mar
ried woman is not now within the saving clause of the section.
Before the last amendment it was held that an action by an
assignee of the claim of a married woman against her husband
for monies belonging to her and converted by the husband to
his own use was not barred by the limitations of § 4978 where
less than six years intervened between such assignment and the
commencement of the action, 37 O. S. 390.
SUBDIVISION IV. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 4987. When action deemed commenced. An action
shall be deemed commenced, within the meaning of this
chapter, as to each defendant, at the date of the sum
mons which is served on him, or on a co-defendant who
is a joint contractor, or otherwise united in interest with
him ; and when service by publication is proper, the ac
tion shall be deemed commenced at the date of the first
publication, if the publication be regularly made. [51
v. 57, §20; S. & C. 949.]
Where an action was commenced to enforce the lien of an
assessment under 64 v. 75, but by m istake the owner of the prem
ises was not made a party_ or served with process, nor was there
any endeavor to make him a party to the suit until after the
expiration of two years—the statutory limitation—there was no
commencement of a proper action, within the meaning of the
exception contained in the act; nor was a proper action com
menced, within the meaning of the exception, where a person
holding another lien upon the property, but who was not united
in interest with the owner, was made a defendant and served
with process before the expiration of the two years, though the
owner, after the expiration of that time, by an amendment of
the petition, was made a party, 24 O. S. 628. The defendants in
an action against vendor and vendee to set aside and cancel a
deed on the ground of fraud, though both defendants are neces
sary parties defendant, yet where the only relief sought is a can
cellation of the deed, are not united in interest, within the
meaning of this section, 39 O. S. 563. The section furnishes the
rule which determines when proceedings in error are to be
deemed commenced, 16 O. S. 284 ; 21 O. S. 131 ; 36 O. S. 312.
§ 4988. When attempt equivalent to commencement.
An attempt to commence an action shall be deemed equiv
alent to the commencement thereof, within the meaning
of this chapter, when the party diligently endeavors to
procure a service; but such attempt must be followed by
service within sixty days. [51 v. 57, § 20; S. & C. 949.]
No time is fixed for service by publication in attachment, 41
O. S. 271. Leaving copy of summons at defendant's place of
business is not a sufficient service upon an individual defend
ant. The record shows an attempt to commence an action not
followed by service of summons within meaning of this section,
25 O. S. 336, 339; see 2 C. C. R. 140.
§ 4989. Absence from state when cause of action ac
crues. Absence afterwards. If, when a cause of action
accrues against a person, he is out of the state, or has
absconded, or concealed himself, the period limited for
the commencement of the action shall not begin to
run until he comes into the state, or while he is so
absconded or concealed ; and if, after the cause of action
accrues, he depart from the state, or abscond, or conceal
himself, the time of his absence or concealment shall not
be computed as any part of the period within which the
action must be brought. [51 v. 57, § 21 ; S. & C. 950.]
Cases under the statute of 1831, and other statutes, 9 O. 34 ; 11
O. 255, 690; 13 O. 430; 14 O. 204.
§ 4990. Aotion barred where it arose, barred in this
state. If, by the laws of the state or country where the
cause of action arose, the action is barred, it is also
barred in this state. [51 v. 57, § 22; S. & C. 950.]
And this was the rule under former statutes, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 246 ;
14 O. 437 ; 16 O. 145 ; 11 O. S. 690. The section does not apply if
a party leave the state where the cause of action arose and come
into this state before the right of action accrues, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 229.
§ 4991. Saving when judgment reversed. If, in an
action commenced in due time, a judgment for the
plaintifff be reversed, or the plaintifff tail otherwise than upon the merits, and the time limited for the commence
ment of such action has, at the date of such reversal or
failure, expired, the plaintifff, or if he die, and the cause
of action survive, his representatives, may commence a
new action within one year after such date; and this
provision shall apply to any claim asserted in any plead
ing by a defendant. [51. v. 57, 1 23 ; S. & C. 950.]
If service is set aside, plaintifff may, within a year, bring his
action anew, notwithstanding the time allowed for commencing
the action may have expired between the time of instituting
proceedings and the setting aside of the service, 17 O. S. 225 ; and
where an action is dismissed without prejudice to a future
action, plaintifff may commence it anew, within a year, notwith
standing the time limited for commencing the action had
expired at the time of the dismissal, 12 O. S. 620. The section
relates to the time within which an original action may be
recommenced, or claims set up by the defendant in such an
action may be reasserted, if either party fail otherwise than upon
the merits, and has no application to proceedings in error, 34
O. S. 537.
§ 4992. Fart payment. New promise, etc, in writing.
When payment has been made upon any demand founded
on contract, or a written acknowledgment thereof, or
promise to pay the same, has been made and signed by the
party to be charged, an action may be brought thereon
within the time herein limited, after such payment (1),
acknowledgment (2), or promise (3). [51 v. 57, §24;
S.&C. 951.]
1. Payment by principal inures to surety, 37 O. S. 388, and part
payment by an administrator, under act 1804, inures to intestate,
13 O. 271 ; but part payment of a joint and several note by one of
several makers will not inure to the others, 25 O. S. 349, and pay
ment of a dividend by an assignee of an insolvent debtor is not
part payment within the meaning of this section, 16 O. S. 566. A
credit on account is not part payment unless shown to have been
so intended, 31 O.S. 424. The petition must showbywhom the
payment wa3 made, 29 O.S.245. 2. 40 O. S.637. The presump
tion of payment nt common law, arising from lapse of time, may
be rebutted by proof that the debtor, within the period required
to raise such presumption, acknowledged such claim to oe an
existing liability, 16O.fc>.498. Under the acts of 1824and 1831,
acknowledgment of the debt and a promise to pay it after it was
barred, did not revive the original cause of action, and the action,
itwas held, must be on thesubsequent promise, 17 O. 9. 3. 19O.
S.454. A verbal promise is not sufficient, 1 C. S. C. R. 324, butwas
before the code, 19 O. S. 413. The plaintifff may set up the barred
demand as a consideration for the new promise, and allege the
new promise as the cause of action, 8 O. S. 215, 220.
§ 4993. Action in name of real party in Interest. An
action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party
in interest, except as provided in sections forty-nine hun
dred and ninety-four and forty-nine hundred and ninetyfive; but when a party asks that he may recover by virtue
of an assignment, the right of set-off, counterclaim, and
defense, as allowed by law, shall not be impaired. [ol
v. 57, \\ 25, 26 ; S. & C. 951, 952.]
The real party in interest is the party who would be benefited
or injured by the judgment in the case. An interest which war
rants making a person a party is not an interest in the action
involved merely, but some interest in the subject matter of the
litigation, 5W.L.M. 80. One of the principal changes effected by
this section of the code is the right conferred upon the assignceot
a chose in action to sue in his own name. Under this provision
an assignee of an account may sue thereon, and where the assign
ment is absolute the assignor is not a proper party to the action,
11 O. S. 374 ; the assignor can not, thereforee, sue in his own name,
36 O. S. 68. An assignee of a judgment obtained in a garnishee
process may maintain an action in his own name, 18 O. S. 134.
The assignee of a reversion and covenants contained in a lease is
the proper party to bring an action to recover for their breach,
9 O. S. 340 ; 42 O. S. 180 ; an assignee of stock of a corporation, to
compel the issuance of a stock certificate, 41O. S. 321 ; an assignee,
by indorsement of a promissory note, though without equitable
interest, may sue in his own name, 29 O. S. 423 ; but an assignee
of a note by mere delivery and for the purpose of collection can
not maintain an action in his own name, 26 O. S. 425 ; and where
an assignment without indorsement, though for value, was made
after maturity, it was held a good defense by the equitable
owner to show that the assignee was not the real party in inter
est, 43 O. S. 284 ; see 74 N. Y. 486 ; but it is a general rule that the
indorsee or payee of a note, though an agent, holding the legal
title, mav, under this section, sue on it in his own name, 47
N.Y. 345,'reversing57 Barb. 179, 189: 20 la. 481, 4&5, Dillon, J.; and
where the assignment was without consideration the assignee to
be accountable for all the proceeds, 44 N. Y. 228, 231 ; see 29 O. S.
423, in writing absolute and by co-teinporaneous agreement the
assignees were to have one-half of the proceeds, 14 N. Y. 322 ;
where the assignmentwas made ascollateral security, 44 Cal. 294 ;
where the assignment was of a promissory note payable to order
without indorsement, 14 Minn. 27; see 3 Kas. 295 (though sub
ject to equitable defenses or claims against the payee, 11 Kas.
464); the assignee has been, in all such cases, allowed to sue in
his own name. In one case the defendant was allowed to set up
as a defense that the payee of the note assigned it to the plaintifff
to secure an indebtedness which had been paid, 11 Ind. 464; but
where the indorsement was for collection, or without considerstion, the indorsee was permitted to sue in his own name," 50
Ind. 319.
Prior to the code, the assignee of part of anentire demand could
not sue at law, 13 O. S. 495, 501 ; see 14 O. 606 ; the action could
only be brought in the name of the assignor, 2 B. Mon. 82, and it
was so held under the code, 21 Mo. 133 ; but it is the rule gener
ally under the code that the assignee of part of a demand is enti
tled to relief by making the assignor a party, 38 Cal. 514 ; 47 Ind.
51 ; and when he refuses to join as plaintifff he may be made a
party defendant, 38 Cal. 514 ; see 11 O. S. 374, 378.
The test of the assignability of a claim is whether it survives
or not. Causes of action which survice to the personal representatice
are assignabte, and those which do not are not assignable, Pomeroy Rem. § 147. As illustrations of those, arising out of contract,
which are assignable, are the following : A contract of guaranty,
1 Bosw. 352 ; 16 O. S. 145 ; a contract to pave streets, 5 O. S. 520 ;
right of a borrower to recover back excessive interest upon a
usurious loan, 64 N. Y. 242 ; a contract for the hire of the service
of state prison convicts, 23 N. Y. 350 ; the right of an officer to
his fees, 14 Abb. Pr. 178 ; 17 O. S. 591, or salary, 27 O. S. 393 ; a
right of action to recover back money lost in gaming, 19 N. Y. 26;
contra, 22 Barb. 82 ; the right of a widow to her dower before
admeasurement, 12 Ind. 37; right to a trade mark, 2 Daly 521 ; a
judgment of damages for the commission of a tort, 11 la. 329 ; a
claim in expectancy, 6 N. Y. 179, if it is not a mere possibility, as
an heir apparent's chance of succession, 25 O. S. 283, 300; 7 O. S.
432; a ball bond, W. 180 (29 L. 62), and bill of lading, 2 C. S. C. R.
291, may be assigned; but a contract for marriage, 1 Pick. 71, is
not assignable, nor a contract of apprenticeship, 1 Mass. 72, nor
contracts stipulating for the performance of services by an attor
ney or medical practitioner, 13 N. Y. 333; nor an executory con
tract for personal services without the employer's consent, 31
O. S. 421, nor a vendor's right of lien, 24 O. S. 402 ; 21 Cal. 172, 178;
nor a wife's inchoate right of dower, 8 N. Y. 110; 27 O. S. 50, 65;
a tenancy at will, 27 O. S. 478, nor a right of way, 23 O. S. 614.
Claims arising from tarts may be assigned, as a claim for fraud
ulently inducing one to enter into the marriage relation, 9 Mo.
497; for fraud or deceit in contracts relating to the sale of real or
personal property, 19 N. Y. 464 ; 24 N. Y. 607 ; contra, 13 N. Y. 322;
a claim by a principal against an agent for negligence, 8 O.S.1:
a right of action to recover damages for the conversion of personal
property, 12 N. Y, 622 ; a demand for compensation arising from
injury to land, 1 D. 58; against a railroad company for negli
gently killing cattle, 22 Barb. 110; a right of action against a
sheriff for neglecting to arrest defendant upon a body execution,
38 Barb. 18; againstabankforneglectingtomakeproperdemand
of a note left for collection, and to take proper steps to charge
indorsers, 6 Robt. 337; a claim under a statute for damages
caused by wrongful death, 15 N. Y. 432. It belongs to the next
of kin in Ohio, 26 O. S. 522. But personal torts, which die with
the person, are not assignable. 8 O. S. 1, as claims for malicious
prosecution, 34 Wis. 259; a claim against a justice of the peace
for nonfeasance, 12 O. S. 181, 184 ; a verdict in an action for a per
sonal tort, 15 Abb. Pr. 342.
Since the third person for whose benefit a promise is made is the
real party in interest, he may sue on such promise, and there
fore, where a promise is made by A to B for a consideration moving from B to payCa sum of money, C may maintain an
action upon the promise in his own name against the promisor
without joining the promisee, 15 O. S. 148; 42 O. S. 82; 22 la. 470.
Assessment. An action for an assessment should be in the
name of the municipal corporation, § 2280 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 2J6 ; 26
O. S. 275 ; 42 O. S. 128. If the assessment is assigned to a con
tractor, he may maintain an action in the name of the city, 31
O. S. 246, but not in his own name, 2 C. S. C. R. 296 (IS72); but
contractors may, under the statute 1876, sue in their own names
for the collection of street assessments where the municipal cor
poration isa properparty defendant. 42 O. S. 586. Severalowncrs
of land assessed for a street improvement may join in an action
to restrain its collection, 24 O. S. 233; see 23 O. S. 625; 38 O. S.
314. The owner of property may enjoin an assessment, where
there isa "substantial defect in the improvement," under § 2289
in an action against the treasurer and municipal corporation,
and \i: 1777 and 1778 have no application to such case, 38 O. S. 314.
Bailment. A consignor named in a hill of lading may main
tain an action for an injury to the goods, although he has no
property general or special therein, 8 Gray, 281. A bailee of
goods may sue a carrier for delivering to the consignee without
payment, that being imposed as a condition of delivery, 55 N.
H.648; possession of goods acquired by plaintifff under a bill of
lading is sufficient to enable him to maintain an action against
one who does not show a belter title, 10J Mass. 515 ; a consignee
may sue a carrier for loss of or damage to goods delivered to it
for transportation, 67 111. 84 ; Id. 543. An action for injury to
sheep while in possession of a lessee during the term of bail
ment must be maintained by the lessee, 49 Cal. 612; a bailee
having charge of a race-horse for the season may maintain an
action for an injury to the horse while racing, 40 Mich. 592 ; 29
Am. Rep. 562. Where a creditor living at a distance from his
debtor requests the payment of a debt without giving specific
Instructions as to how the money shall be sent, and the debtor
sends it by an express company and it is lost in transitu, the
debtor may maintain an action against the company for its re
covery, 40 O. S. 451.
Bankruptcy. In case of bankruptcy the right of action passes
to the assignee, 36 O. S. 63; 40 O. S. 62a. Upon a suit by one
partner against a copartner for dissolution of copartne'rship
upon the bankruptcy of plaintifff being shown, his assignee will
be allowed to be substituted as plaintifff, 4 Ben. 92. If an as
signee refuses or neglects to sue for property fraudulently trans
ferred, the creditors may do so and make the assignee, the debtor
and transferee parties, 72 N. Y. 70.
Bills and nates—see assignee. The party having the right to
the money is the proper person to sue, 3 Bosw. 560; the real
owner may sue though the note is made to order and not in
dorsed, 12 Kas. 570; 19 O. S. 536 ; the holder is presumed to be
the owner in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and is
entitled primafacie to sue thereon, 3 McLean 101 ; but it is a good
defense to show, where the assignment was made after maturity,
that the assignee was not the real party in interest, 43 O. S. 284.
The holder of a note without indorsement and for collection
merely can not sue on it in his own name, 26 O. S. 425, otherwise
if he were to have part of the proceeds, 1 Bull 170 ; a bona fide
indorsee may sue thereon, 16 Abb. Pr. 146 ; an indorsee may 
sue thereon, though, for a consideration to be paid after
collection, 25 N. Y. 025, find though without equitable interest,
29 O. S. 423. One holding notes as trustee for himself and others
may sue thereon in his own name, 29 O. S. 330, and one to whom
the legal title in a note and mortgage has been transferred for
collection in his own name may sue thereon in his own name,
3 Bull 365; 7 Kec. 9. Where a note was made payable to A am
administrator of B, on A's death his administrator, and not the
administrator de bonis non of B, is the proper party to sue on it,
7 O. (Pt. 1) 208.
Constable may sue justice for irregularly replevying goods held
by him on execution, 1 Bull 234.
Contractors may sue in their own names for assessments
under act 1876, 42 O. S. 585.
Conversion. A bailee may sue for conversion, W. 744 ; a mort
gagor of chattels, W.552; a sheriff' must sue alone for conversion
of attached property, 17 O. S. 183; a pledgor may sue a pledgee
for conversion without making a tender, 1 H. 532; a tenant in
common may sue a cotenant for conversion of the whole prop
erty, 60 Barb. 564.
Corporation, aiter dissolution, could not sue; the receiver
only could sue in its name, 13 O. 209. By statute a dissolved cor
poration may sue in its own name, §5683, and be sued by its
corporate name, j( 5684. Trustees of a corporation must sue as
such and not in their individual names, 13 O. 250.
Death by negligence. The personal representatives bring the
action ; the widow and next of kin can not maintain it in their
own names, 20 O. S. 522 ; the action can not be maintained when
the death occurs outside of this state, 2 C. S. C. R. 82; 25 O. S.667;
an administrator in this state can not maintain the action under
the statute of another state, 10 O. S. 121.
Ejectment. The owner of the legal title only can maintain
ejectment in this state, \ 5781 ; see 2 Neb. 79, under a similar stat
ute. (In Kansas the owner of the equitable title may maintain
ejectment, 10 Kas. 248.) A reversioner, 5 O. 28; a tenant by the
curtesy, 32 O. S. 184; trustees of a religious society, 13 O. 129;
12 O. S. 248; a mortgagee after condition broken, 2 O. 223 ; 7 O.
(Pt. 2) 70 i a wife for property decreed her as alimony, W. 205,
1 O. S. 405, may maintain ejectment. Formerly the husband
should be joined with the wife in a suit for the possession of the
wife's land not her separate property, 20 O. S. 128.
Fraudulad conveyance. A judgment creditor of an insolvent
corporation, though the corporation has been dissolved and a
receiver appointed, may maintain an action in the nature of a
creditor's bill, the receiver neglecting or refusing to do so. to set
aside a sale made by a corporation previous to dissolution for
the purpose of defrauding its creditors* 40 O. S. 575.
Insurance. Where a policy is on account of whom it may con
cern, the person to whom it is issued may sue on behalf of all the
owners in his own name ns trustee of an express trust, 6 O. S.
554 ; 26 O. S. 004 ; if such person die, his personal representatives
may sue, 65 Me. 385. An assignee of a life insurance policy may
sue on it in his own name, 38 Wis. 542. One who has obtained a
valid insurance upon his own life may dispose of it as he sees
fit in the absence of prohibitory legislation or contract stipu

unless he had an estate of inheritance, 2 Saund. 252n 7. The
heir could not sue for waste committed during the life of the
ancestor, nor the grantee of the reversion for waste committed
before the grant, Id. lly statute, in some states, a remainder
man and reversioner may maintain waste for injuries to their
estates, N. Y. Code, Civ. Pro., § 1665; Bliss Code PI. I 33, and an
heir may bring an action for waste committed during the life of
the ancestor, N. Y. Code, etc:, § 1652. in this state one coparce
ner may sue another for waste, \ 5774. A tenant in dower, 84 v.
135, and tenant for Hie, 84 v. 134, can not commit waste without
forfeiting the part of their estates on which the waste was com
mitted to those having the immediate estates in reversion or
remainder, to whom they are liable in damages.
§ 4994. Plaintiff in action on bond. The rule pre
scribed in the preceding section may be so applied, when
a person forfeits his bond, or renders his sureties liable,
that any person injured thereby, or who is by law enti
tled to the benefit of the security, may bring an action
thereon, in his own name, against the person and his
sureties, to recover the amount to which he is entitled
by reason of the delinquency, which action may be
prosecuted on a certified copy of the bond; and the
custodian of the bond shall deliver such copy to any
person claiming to be so injured, on tender of the
proper fee ; but the provisions of this section as to the form of the action shall not be imperative, if provision
is otherwise made by law ; nor shall a judgment for one
delinquency preclude the same or another party from
an action on the same instrument for another delin
quency. [51 v. 57 ; \\ 566, 567 ; S. & C. 1123, 1124.]

In an action against the surviving obligors of an official bond the
personal representatives of the principal are not necessary parties, 25 O. S. 620.
§ 4995. How executor, trustee, etc., may sue. An
executor, administrator, or guardian, a trustee of an ex
press trust, a person with whom or in whose name, a con
tract is made for the benefit of another, era person ex
pressly authorized by statute, may bring an action without
joining with him the person for whose benefit it is pros
ecuted ; and officers may sue and be sued in such name
as is authorized by law. [51 v. 57, § 27 ; S. & C. 953.]
Executor, administrator. Where a contract is made with an
executor or administrator personally after the death of the tes
tator or intestate, or where money is received by the person
sued after death, in such cases the executor or administrator
may either sue in his own name, or as executor or adminis
trator, 14 Mass. :J27. An executor or administrator may sue in
his own name on a judgment obtained by him, 6 Yerg. 417 ; on a
note payable to him as representative, 0 N. Y. 168 ; or bearer,
112 Mass. 4j0, or to him individually for money due the estate,
50 Ala. 431 ; to recover back money of the estate paid by mistake,
W. 174 ; 55 How. Pr. 434, or for the price of property sold by him
as representative, 60 111. 30, or for the wrongful conversion of the
property of the estate, 24 Cal. 167, though such conversion was
made prior to his appointment, 11 How. 11 ; and no demand is
necessary if the taking was tortious, 50 Cal. 367. Where a note is
made payable to A, administrator of B, on A's death, his adminis
trator, aiid not the administrator de bonis non of B, is the
proper party to sue on it, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 268. Under the statutes an
executor or administrator may petition to sell real estate of
decedent to pay debts when there is insufficient personalty,
§ 6137, and for that purpose may bring an action to get posses
sion of land fraudulently conveyed by decedent, §6140; may
sue for injuries causing death, § 6134, 26 O. S, 522 ; may sue per
sons wasting the personal estate, \\ 6053, 6059 ; 42 O. S. 325 ; may
foreclose a mortgage of decedent, l\ 6070, 6072; and may main
tain an action in the court of common pleas against the cred
itors, legatees, etc., asking the direction or judgment of the

1 C. C. R. 320. A foreign executor or administrator may sue in
the courts of this state, §6133; and au administrator de bonis
non may sue on the bond of a former administrator for the
recovery of, § 6020, or injury to, \ 6051, the assets and personal
effects of decedent ; see also ? 5800.
Trustee of an express trust. An express trust is denned to be a
trust created by the direct and positive acts of the parties, by
some writing, or deed, or will, 22 N. Y. 389 ; 28 Ind. 112. It often
seems difficult to distinguish between such trustees and those
with whom or in whose name contracts are made for the benefit
of others, and many of the code states make the term " trustee
of an express trust ' ' cover this latter class of persons, Bliss Code
PI. £ 55. As illustrations of the former may be mentioned: An
assignee for the benefit of creditors, 4 Abb. Pr. 106; an obligee
of a statutory bond, 25 O. S. 507; 29 O. S. 452; one holding pos
session of money upon trust for the benefit of others, 1 C. C. R.
57; 13 Bull 294; assignees of a contract in trust to reimburse out
of the proceeds thereof third persons for advances made, 4 Keyes
514 ; a mortgagee trustee for holders of promissory notes secured
by mortgage, 29 O. S. 330; trustees appointed to take and collect
subscriptions for colleges and other similar purposes, 34 How.
Pr. 320; insurance brokers holding an open policy of insurance
for " those and whom it may concern," 6 O. S. 554; one to whom
the legal title in a note and mortgage has been transferred for
the purpose of collection, 3 Bull 365; 7 Rec. 9; an assignee of
stock subscriptions, 12 Wis. 668; see 41 O. S. 321. A part owner
of a vessel in whose name a policy of insurance on the whole
vessel, for account of the owners is issued, becomes a trustee for
all the owners ; and, in case of loss, may sue on the policy in his
own name alone, 26 ii. S. 664. In an ordinary deed of trust, to
secure a debt with power of sale, the trustee upon sale under
the power, is the proper party plaintifff to recover the purchase
money, 31 Mo, 535. A mortgagee of lands in trustfor the use and
benefit of another is the proper party to sue for possession or
damages by trespass or other injury, 24 Wis. 422; a sheriff is the
proper party to sue a purchaser for"the price of property sold on
execution, 25 O. S. 529. Where money, the separate property of
the wife, was loaned to parties who knowing it to be hers, gave
back notes to secure its payment to the husband in his own
name, the husband does not become by such transaction the
trustee of an express trust who must sue in his owu name,
1 H. 537. 539. Under 2 6341, providing that the successor of a
trustee or assignee failing to deliver over to the successor trust
property, may proceed against such trustee or assignee by action
in the "common pleas or otherwise," the successor may bring
his action in the the superior court, I C. C. R. 20.
One with whom a contract is made for the benefit of another. An
agent may sue on a contract made by him in his own name, 38
O. S. 397; 13 Bull 294; 1C.C. It. 57; though the name of the prin
cipal is disclosed, 22 N. Y. 389; 38 O. S. 397; and where a contract
is made between two persons for the benefit of a third, such
third person may sue upon it in his own name, 4 O. K. 333;
though the instrument be under seal and the beneficiary not
named therein, 42 O. S. 82, the beneficiary may sue in his own
name or in the name of the contracting party, 15 O. S. 151. An
auctioneer may sue for the price of goods sold by him whether
he have an interest in the price or not, 7 N. Y. 220, 224 ; 1 E. D.
Smith, 590; the master of a vessel for freight, 17 Abb. Pr. 73; or
for conversion of cargo, 13 Minn. 85; a factor who transacts
business in his own name, 2 Sanf. 706; a contractor for the bene
fit of third parties, 1 Bosw. 43 ; a sheriff for the price of property
sold on execution, 11 Minn. 220; a payee of a note for the benefit of others, 12 Kas. 85; a sheriff on a replevin bond, 2 I). 592;
41 O. S. 591 ; and where a grantee in a deed of land was acting
as agent for another and the purchase price was paid with that
other's money, the grantee was held the proper party to sue for
a breach of a covenant broken immediately upon the execution
of the deed, 14 O. S. 41 7, 423.

action for damages for injury resulting to a private party by

name as treasurer; and, under § 2859, to compel the payment
of taxes it is not necessary that his individual name should
appear or be inserted as plaintifff, 31 O. S. 317. Prosecuting attor
ney of the county, in addition to the prosecution of criminals,
brings actions on forfeited recognizances, § 7183, in the name of
the state without joining the name of the county for whose
benefit the suit is prosecuted, 21 O. S. 183 (35 v. 37); sues on bond
of delinquent county treasurer, § 1133; attends to suits on behalf
of asylums for the insane, § 718 ; may enjoin in the name of the

§ 4996. How married woman may sue and be sned.
A married woman shall sue and be sued as if she were
unmarried, and her husband shall be joined with her
only when the cause of action is in favor of or against
both her and her husband. [81 v. 65; 76 v. 3, \ 28.]
Synopsis of legislation ; see 19 Bull 319.
A married woman may now bind herself, to the same extent
and in the same manner, by contract as though she were unmar
ried, 13 Bull 15; 12 Bull 229; 14 Bull 1; Id. 197; Id. 399; see9Bull
333 ; 12 Bull 229 ; and it has been held that she can be compelled
to execute a contract in writing made jointly with her husband
to convey her separate estate, though the contract is not in the
form of a deed and there is no acknowledgment by her separate
and apart from her husband, 1 C. C. R. 408; but the laws of 1887,
84 v. 132, dispense with separate acknowledgments of deeds,
etc., by married women ; provide that married persons may take,
hold and dispose of property, real or personal, the same as if
unmarried; may, in the same manner, contract with each other,
and neither husband nor wife is ci.swerable for the acts of the
Other ; see § 5319.
Plaintiff. Betore these amendments a married woman could,
and of course can now, sue alone to recover a debt due her, 31
O. S. 579; for the seduction of her husband, 31 O. S. 621 ; for
assault and battery, 37 O. S. 10 ; for an injury to property decreed
her as alimony, 1 O. S. 403, and bring ejectment for it, W. 205 ;
after seven years abandonment, 33 O. S. 155; when abandoned by
husband in foreign country when she came here, 5 O.S. 580, and
when abandoned under 3111, 3113, and for slander, 4 Bull 31 ;
contra, Id. 59(3. She does not now prosecute by next friend, 4
Bull 690. It has been hold that she may sue her husband to
recover land, her separate property, 1 Lans. 421; and her per
sonal property, or the value of services rendered in his business
or under such circumstances that a promise to pay would be
implied, 1 Lans. 164; and when the husband and wife were
owners In common of land she might maintain a suit against
him for partition, 47 N. Y. 467, but could not recover damages
against him for assault and battery, 44 Barb. 366, or slander, 42
Barb. 641 ; and the husband could not recover against his wife
for services rendered to her in the management of her separate
estate, there having been no express agreement for payment, 62
Barb. 531. Can not sue for loss of husband's wages, etc., 17 Bull
370 ; see liquor laws.
Joinder as plaintifffs. It has been held that the husband must
join with the wife in an action for malpractice of physician in
attending the wife, W. 466 ; for loss of wife's baggage, 1 W. L. M.
451; for slander, 4 Bull 596 ; contra. Id. 31 ; may loin in an action
to recover a debt due the wife, 31 O. S. 579, and that where lands
were conveyed to her prior to the act of 1861, she could not alone
maintain an action to recover them from a stranger, 20 O. S. 128 ;
but where the husband was induced by false representations to
purchase land, and the title was taken in his wife's name, but
the consideration wholly paid by him, she could not be joined
in an action for deceit, 13 O. S. 72; that the petition alleging a
joint cause of action in favor of husband and wife and show
ing a cause of action in favor of the husband only was demur
rable,
Id.
Defendant.
Where the action concerned her separate property,
was upon her written obligation, concerned business in which
she was a partner, brought to set aside a deed or will, to collect
a legacy, or was between her and her husband, her husband was
not required to join as plaintifff or be joined as defendant, 76 v.
3, \ 28 ; but in an action on her promissory note it was held that
coverture should be averred, 1 Bull 73, and that she had separate
property subject to be charged, 26 0. S. 27, though it was not
necessary to describe it, 2 Bull 122; 5 Bull 817; nor to allege that
she intended to charge it by executing the note, for that was
presumed, 35 O. S. 296 ; Id. 270. It is not now necessary, under
the present statutes or those of 1880, to aver or prove that she is
a married woman, or the owner of a separate estate, or that she
contracted the debt or obligation with reference to her separate
estate, or for its benefit, 84 v. 132 ; see 14 Bull 399 ; 16 Bull, 291 '
61 N. Y. 249 ; 65 How.Pr. 264.
Joinder as defendants. The code, it is held, does not change
the common law liability of the husband for the torts of the wife,
8 O. S. 594 ; 49 N. Y. 193; Bliss Code Pi. § 85. In actions for dam
ages arising from the wrongful act of a married woman, husband
and wife, it is held, must be joined as defendants, 32 O. S. 299, and
if, in the commission of a tort, she acted under marital coercion,
and such fact does not appear on the face of the petition, her
defense in that respect must be made by answer, Id. Under the
recent amendment, $ 3115, 84 v. 133, neither husband nor wife is
answerable for the acts of the other, and it would appear that a
joinder of the husband would not now be required lor the wife's
tort. At any rate, even before the amendments of 1887, where
the tort was in respect to her separate property, the action should
be against her individually, without joining her husband, Bliss
Code PI. % 86 ; as in an action for alleged conversion ol'chattels by
the wife under colorof aclaim of ownership, 1 Lam. 295; fordamages caused by the falling of a chimney of a house owned by her,
2 Daly 140 ; and when the wife, being the owner of a farm upon
which she, with her husband and family, lived, with cattle and
horses that were used in connection with the land, for the sup
port of her family, an action was sustained against her alone for
damages caused by the cattle and horses in straying upon the
plaintifffs ground, 45 N. Y. 230; and where the husband, an agent
of the wife, made fraudulent representations in the sale of her
land, it was held that the tort was hers ; that it had relation to
her separate property, and that she should be sued alone, 47
N. Y. 577.
25

the rights of husband and wife, were passed :
§ 3108. Husband and wife contract towards each other obliga

her support until she offers to return, unless she was justified,
by his misconduct, in abandoning him.
§ 4997. When wife may defend. When husband and
wife are sued together, the wife may defend for her own
right; and, if the husband neglect to defend, she may
also defend for his right. [51 v. 57, § 29; S. & C. 954.]
The section is not applicable to actions against husband and
wife in which the trial and judgment must be joint, 8 O. S. 594.
A married woman, sued with her husband, may defend sepa
rately by attorney, 1 H. 20; and where husband and wife were
sued for alleged trespasses of the wife on property in which she
claimed an easement as appurtenant to a lot owned by her, in
default for answer by the husband, the wife, it was held, might
make a separate defense, and, if her defense was good, it was
complete as to both, 42 O. S. 329.
§ 4998. Aotion of insane person and infant by guardian,
etc. The action of an insane person must be brought
by his guardian; the action of an infant must be
brought by his guardian or next friend; and, when the
action is brought by his next friend, the court may dismiss it, if it is not for the benefit of the infant, or sub
stitute the guardian, or any person, as the next friend.
[51 v. 57, 1 30; S. & C. 954.]
The guardian of an insane person must sue in his own name,
1 W. L. J. 454; see Id. 96; notice to the insane person of hia
appointment is not required, 10 Bull 321 ; but see amendment,
6302, 86 v. 61. The affidavit verifying a pleading may be made
y an agent or attorney when plaintifff is an infant or insane,
§ 5109. Minority should be distinctly averred, and will not be
presumed, 5 O. 227. The disability of infancy of a female is
removed at the age of eighteen, 3 O. S. 80. Foreign guardian
ineligible, 19 Bull 106.
§4999. IText friend liable for costs. The next friend
shall be liable for the costs of the action brought by
him, and, when a next friend is insolvent, the court
may, on motion, require security therefore. [51 v. 57,
§ 31 ; S. & C. 954.]
The infant is not liable to judgment for costs, 8 Neb. 336. The
guardian for an infant plaintifff is responsible for costs, under
the New York Code, Civil Pro., \ 469; 29 How. 344; 10 Abb. 41:
but not the guardian of an infant defendant unless specially
charged therewith by order of court for personal misconduct,
Id. \ 477.
§ 5000. Defense of insane person. The defense of an
insane person must be by his legally appointed guard
ian, or, if there is no guardian, or the guardian has an
adverse interest, by a trustee for the suit, appointed by
the court; and if the insanity of a party be discovered,
or he become insane after the action is brought, it shall
be thereafter prosecuted or defended by his guardian,
or his trustee appointed as provided in this section.
[51. v. 473, §7; S. & C. 384.]
The defense of an insane person must be by his guardian.
15 Neb. 295, and before the statute it was the duty of the court
to appoint a guardian ad litem for an insane person, 1 0.S. 554,
and no decree could be taken against him without an answer by
such guardian, Id.; but a judgment rendered against an insane
person, without the intervention of a guardian or trustee, and
in favor of one having knowledge of the insanity, is not void,
31 O. S. 247 ; see 11 Bull 10.
§ 5001. Duties and compensation of guardian ad litem.
The court shall require a guardian ad litem, or a trus
tee appointed under the preceding section, faithfully to
discharge his duty, and, upon his failure so to do, may
remove him, and appoint another in his stead ; and the
court may fix a compensation for his services, which
shall be taxed in the costs against the minor or insane
person. [51 v. 473, \ 8 ; S. & C. 384.]
§ 5002. How insanity of party determined. When
the insanity of a party is not manifest to the court, and
the fact of insanity is disputed by a party or an at
torney in the action, the court may try the question,
or empanel a jury to try the same. [51 v. 473, § 7 ;
S. & C. 384.]
§ 5003. Defense of infant by guardian ad litem. The
defense of an infant must be by a guardian for the suit,
who may be appointed by the court in which the action
is prosecuted, or by a judge thereof, or by a probate
judge- [51 v. 57, § 32 ; S. & C. 954.]
It is error to render a decree against infant defendants until
the appointment and acceptance of a guardian, 3 O. 355; but a
judgment can not be collaterally impeached because minor
defendants brought in by publication oi notice had no guard
ian ad litem appointed for them, 18 O. 535. Process must be
properly served before it is competent for the court to appoint a
guardian ad litem, 1 H. 287 ; see '$ 5047. When appointed it is the
duty of the guardian to mate a proper defense, 17 O. S. 484; see
5078. Under the act of 1858 a guardian could appear and
efend for his ward as effectually as though he were appointed
guardian ad litem, 21 O. S. 651. A decree against minor defend
ants, rendered upon the answer of their guardian ad iitem, may
be impeached or reversed for fraud, 12 O. 351.
§ 5004. Appointment of guardian ad litem. The ap
pointment may be made upon the application of the
infant, if, being of the age of fourteen years, he apply
within twenty days after the return of the summons, or
service by publication ; and in case of his being under
said age, or of his neglect so to apply, the appointment
may be made on the application of the plaintifff, or a
friend of the infant; but the appointment can not be
made until after service of summons, or publication.
[51 v. 57, \\ 32, 33; S. & C. 954, 955.]
But service will be presumed where the record is silent as to
that fact, 1 O. S. 369 ; see 15 O. 089.
§ 5005. Joinder of plaintifffs. All persons having an
interest in the subject of the action, and in obtaining
the relief demanded, may be joined as plaintifffs, except
as otherwise provided. [51 v. 57, § 34; S. & C. 955.]
Account and accounting. In an action for obtaining an account
ing all persons interested should bo made parties, 1 Barb. Ch. 97 ;
7 Cans 95 ; 81 N. C. 28. In a suit by one of several wards for an
account against his guardian, the sureties upon his official bond,
and the other wards interested in the general fund, must be
parties, 8 Fla. 77 ; in a suit in equity, by a portion of the members of a firm against a co-partner for an accounting of the fund,
ali the partners must be parties, 38 111. 27; in a suit by an
administrator of a deceased partner, to have an account of the
partnership affairs, the heir is not a necessary party, 17 Wall. 417.
All the creditors secured by a deed of trust must be made par
ties to a suit by one of the same class for an account of the trust
fund, 5 Jones Eq. 14. The assignor of an account as collateral
security should, if made a party at all, be made a party plaintifff
in an action against a debtor by the assignee on the account,
11 O. S. 374, 377.
Assessment. Several owners may join in an action to restrain
the collection of an illegal assessment or tax, 38 O. S. 314 ; 23 O. S.
605 ; 24 O. S. 232.
Assignment for creditors. Several beneficiaries, under a con
veyance for the beuefit of creditors of a mortgagor, may unite
in an answer setting up usury as a defense in a suit to foreclose
by the mortgagee, 14 O. S. 200, 211.
Attorney. In an action for damages against a railroad for
negligence, an attorney who has received a certain amount of
the sum recovered as compensation is not a necessary party
plaintifff, 26 la. 141.
Bills and notes. Joint owners must join as plaintifffs. When
a note is executed to joint payees, upon the death of one, the
right of action vests in the survivor, and upon his death in his
administrator, 3 Head. 316. The representative of a joint payee
and the survivor can not join in an action on such note, 40 111.
114; Bliss Code PI. §62; but in an action on a joint note paya
ble to several, if one becomes bankrupt, his assignee must be
joined as plaintifff, 3 O. S. 284.
Bond. In an action for relief against a judgment on a bond
all the obligors should be parties plaintifff, 8 O. 4;J. In an action
on an assignee's or trustee'', bond, under §6341, a joint suit
against all the obligors is the only remedy, 1 C. C. R. 20, 21.
Attaching creditors may join as plaintifffs "in an action upon
an attachment bond, though not named as payees therein.
10 O. B. 478 ; and the action may be prosecuted by those obligees
who have an interest in the damages sought to be recovered
without making the other obligees, who have no interest in the
action, parties, 23 O. S. 358.
Community of interest. Persons having separate and inde
pendent claims can not be compelled to prosecute them in a
single action, 16 O. 373 ; see 10 O. 456.
Coparceners must join in an action on warranty, 10 O. 442.
Executors and administrators. All the acting executors or
administrators must join, Pomeroy Rem. § 261 ; but if a portion
only nave proved, the others need not be made parties, though
they may not have formally renounced, Id. It is not indispen
sable though that all the executors or administrators should be
plaintifffs, it is enough if all are before the court so that one
executor or administrator may sue as plaintifff if he makes his
co-executor or administrator defendant, 1 Green Ch. 288. In
an action by an executor to sell land in order to pay the debts
of deceased, the widow and heirs, devisees, or persons having
the next estate of inheritance, mortgagees and other lienholders and trustees holding the legal title, are necessary parties,
§6142; and in an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance
all persons holding or claiming thereunder, Id. A mortgagee prior to 1858 was not a necessary party to an action by an admin
istrator to sell lands to pay debts, 11 O. S. 486. Since then the
lien of a mortgagee not made a party to the proceedings remains
unaffected, 19 O. S. 472; but when an administrator files a peti
tion to sell to pay debts, land of decedent or land conveyed by
him in fraud of creditors, he can not join as co-plaintifff one of
the creditors, 2 Clew Rep. 137.
Guardian and ward. When one is the several guardian of
each of three wards, and not the joint guardian of all, a suit
for their joint benefit can not be sustained on his bond, but an
amendment will be allowed by striking out two of the names,
10 W. L. J. 163.
Heirs may maintain trespass without joining the widow
where the will leaves real estate to the widow and heirs
in certain proportions, 2 Clev. Rep. 81. The heirs and ad
ministrator of an illegitimate child may jointly maintain an
action to enforce a contract between his father and mother by
which his father was to leave him a share of his estate, 7 Bull
183. Heirs can not sue an executor or administrator under
§ 6053-6059 for wasting the estate, 42 O. S. 325 ; and can not bring
an action to recover assets belonging to the estate where there
are no outstanding debts, or compel an accounting bv executors
of deceased who had a life estate in, and wrongfully disposed of,
such assets by will, 25 O. S. 668.
Injunction. Several persons may unite in an action to restrain
a public nuisance, 1 1). 401, when specially injured, 1 H. 52;
4 Bull 156; but they must show that they have been specially
injured, 23 O. S. 523 ; 2 D. 516 ; 4 O. 376. Several owners of sepa
rate lots may unite to enjoin the collection of an illegal assess
ment or tax, 38 O. S. 314; 23 O. S. 605; 24 O. S. 232; contra,
10 O. 235.
Injuries to person. For injuries to the person each one gener
ally should sue alone, 1 Chitty PI. 64 ; Bliss Code PI. § 26 ; as in
slander and libel, 3 E. D. Smith 337; 38 la. 355; 36 la. 563;
malicious prosecution, 14 la. 575; deceit, 46 la. 323; but the
wrongful act may injure two or more persons in their joint
relation, when a joint action will lie ; as in an action for libel and
slander against a partnership, the partners may join, 11 Moore
360; 2 East. 426; 3 Bos. & Pul. 150 ; and where false and fraudu
lent representations concerning the solvency of a person were
made to a partnership, by which they were induced to sell him
goods and sustained loss thereby, a joint action, it was held,
might be brought by all the partners, 13 N. Y. 322 ; and two per
sons wero permitted to sue jointly for malicious prosecution
When the special damage laid was that they jointly incurred
expense in procuring their liberation, 10 Moore 446 : and it was
held not a misjoinder for husband and wife to join in an action
for slander of the wife, because her reputation was his property
as well as hers, 4 Bull 506; 2 Clev. Rep. 260; contra, 4 Bull 31.
Joint creditors can not, by a division of their claims among
themselves, acquire separate rights of action against their
debtor. If the debtor, nowever, procures a release of part of
them, he can not object to the others proceeding against him in
equity, 2 O. S. 13.
Joint onmers of chattels must join in an action for conversion,
44 Barb. 428; inactions on contracts relating to them, 32 N. if.
685 ; and for the recovery of possession, 13 N. Y. 173. One joint owner can not maintain replevin against his co-owner in the
exclusive possession, 53 Mo. 397; 50 Cal. 474.
.Tnint tenancy never existed in Ohio, 10 O. 1.
Legatees and distributees. A legatee and purchaser of plaintifff
pendente lite can not join in a bill of revivor, their interests
being adverse, W. 600. Distributees, it is held, can not join in an
action against an administrator to recover their shares, 2 O. 156 ;
see g o^io.
Mechanics' liens. Owners of three separate mechanics' llena
on one building can not join as plaintifffs, 1 Kas. 293 ; but it
has been held that material men and mechanics who arc enti
tled to a lien on a building, and whose claims are several, with
out any community of interest in the claims themselves, may
join in an equitable action to enforce their liens, 33 Cal. 502.
Mortgage. Foreclosure. All persons who are entitled to share
in the proceeds, whether they are interested jointly, or in com
mon, or severally, must be made co-plaintifffs, or at least brought
into the action as defendants. Story Eq. PI. \ 201. The owner
of the mortgage may foreclose it, though he has pledged the
same as collateral security, 64 N. Y. 657. After his death the
administrator, and not the heir, is the proper party to foreclose
it, 6070, 6072; 34 N. J. Eq.33n; 17 O. 264 (administrator de bonis
non). The assignee of a mortgage may foreclose it, 7 Johns. Ch.
144; and though the form of the assignmeut should be in
writing, a parol assignment is sufficient, 29 Mich. 9 ; 30 N. J. Eq.
244; but in such case the assignor should be made a party, 68
Ala. 147. In Maine aud Massachusetts a parol assignee can not
foreclose in his own name, 12 Gray Si ; 23 Me. 345. The assignee
of a mortgage as collateral security may foreclose it, 7 Johns. Ch.
144 ; and the assignee of a mortgage note, though the mortgage
is not assigned, 16 Wall. 271 ; Jones Mortg. \ 1377 ; but not the
assignee of a mortgage without the note, 17 Abb. Pr. 342 ; 47
Barb. 253. He may join the assignor with him, 23 Ind. 118, or
make him defendant, 46 Me. 445; and where it is the law that
the transfer of the note carries with it the security, 4 O. 318,
the assignee may foreclose without making the mortgagee a
party, 35 Mich. 474. An assignee in bankruptcy, Wiltsie, Parties
in Foreclosure, § 22, or his assignee, 12 N. J. Eq. 543, a receiver of
an insolvent corporation, 36 111. 133, or his successor, may fore
close a mortgage, Id. An exeeutoror administrator may foreclose
a mortgage executed to him as such, 39 Ga. 26; and after his
death his personal representatives are necessary parties, 10 N. Y.
509 ; 4 Abb. 280 (but a foreign executor or administrator can not
foreclose unless he has received his appointment from the court
of the state in which the property is situated, 30 N. J. Eq. 106 ;
34 Id. 33 and note); and a person to whoma mortgage is executed
in an official capacity, or his successor, 36 111. 133. When a cestui
que trust brings a bill to foreclose, the trustee is a necessary party,
Story Eq. PI. \\ 201, 209 ; 6 Mich. 70; 16 N. J. Eq. 28 ; but a trustee
to whom a mortgage is executed to secure funds of the trust
estate may foreclose in his own name as such trustee, 36 N. J. Eq.
548. As trustee of an express trust a mortgagee may foreclose
in his own name, though he owns no part of the mortgage debt
in his own right, 29 O. S. 330 ; see W. 431 ; and the holder of bonds
secured by a mortgage may foreclose on behalf of himself and
other bondholders, 10 Abb. Pr. 296; see 35 O. S. 307, 315 ; and tha
bondholders are neither necessary nor proper parties, 10 O. S. 372 i and in a suit by a trustee to foreclose a mortgage, it has been
held not necessary to make the cestuis que trusteiit parties, though
the trustee be insolvent. 2 I). 415. So when a mortgage has been
assigned to a trustee, in trust for the benefit of creditors, the trust
ees are the only necessary parties plaintifff in foreclosure, 25
Beav. 253 ; and the creditors need not be joined, Id.; 1 Barb. Ch.
254. Judgment creditors, however, as beneficiaries, have been
allowed to come in and set up usury against the petition where
the assignee fails or refuses to answer for them, 14 O. S. 200.
Joint mortgagers may unite in foreclosure, Pomeroy Rem. § 255 ;
and persons having a united interest in the debt secured, even,
if their interests be several, Jones Mortg. § 1368; and where one
of two joint mortgagees has become the owner of the equity of
redemption the oilier may maintain a bill for foreclosure
against him to the extent of his interest, 30 Conn. 344. On the
death of one of a number of joint owners of a mortgage, the
surviving owners can foreclose without bringing in the personal
representatives or heirs of the deceased joint mortgagee, 8 Gray
154 ; 30 Md. 530; contra, 16 N. J. Eq. 28; 32 Id. 678, 683. \ partner
holding a mortgage as security for a debt due the partnership
should join the other partners with him as plaintifffs in an action
to foreclose, 30 N. J. Eq.435, though it is executed to one member,
Id.; 3 Vt. 100; unless, perhaps, it is held by one as trustee, 44 Mich.
634 ; and if any refuse to join as co-plaintifffs they may be brought
in as defendants, the fact being stated in the pleadings, 36 N. J.
Eq. 403. In case of the death of a partner pending foreclosure
the survivors take the legal title, and the representatives of de
ceased are not necessary parties, 78 111. 120. A surety of a debt
secured by a mortgage on lands of the principal, on paying the
debt, is subrogated in equity to the rights of the mortgagee, and
may foreclose In his own name without an assignment of the
mortgage and bond, 42 N. Y. 89; 2 Greenl. (Me.) 341. The hus
band of a wife owning a mortgage as separate property is not a
necessary or proper party in an action to foreclose it, 34 Vt. 256 ;
but objection to the joinder of the husband should be taken
by demurrer, and can not be insisted on at the hearing, Id.; and
where a bond and mortgage were made to the husband and wife,
the wife was held untitled to foreclose in her own name on the
death of the husband, on the ground of survivorship in joint
tenancy and because the money was loaned by the wite, 20 Ind.
108. The holder of one of seceral notes may foreclose a mortgage
securing them, but he must make the other mortgagees or hold
ers of notes defendants, 45 Ind. 355 ; 33 111. 284. Holders of notes
can not join as plaintifffs; only one such holder can be plaintifff,
and he must make the other holders defendants, as there is no
community of interest between them, Jones Mortg. § 1378; 14
Kas. 387; but where one holds two or more notes he may fore
close them in the same action, 33 111. 284; and the holder of two
mortgages upon the same premises may foreclose them in one
suit, although they were given by different persons, if made to
secure the same debt, 7 Ala. 823 ; he is not allowed to bring sepa
rate foreclosure suits. 10 Paige 415. The holder of a note secured
by a mortgage transferred after maturity without indorsement
by a person not having title, it has been held, can not, as against
the real owner, have a right to foreclose the mortgage, 43 O. S.
284. If the mvrtghgec has absolutely assigned the mortgage and re
tains no further interest in it, he is not a proper party,20 O. 474; but if he has assigned it as collateral security, 7 Johns. Ch. 144,
if the assignment is not absolute, and the mortgagee retains
an interest in the security, 10 N. J. Eq. 320, he is a necessary iwrty
to the foreclosure ; and though the assignment is in terms abso
lute, and expresses the payment of a full consideration, the
mortgagee should still be made a party if the assignee is ac
countable to him for any part of the proceeds of it, 1 Sandf. Ch.
76. Redemption. The mortgagor and all others having a right to
redeem should be made parties plaintifff or defendant, Pomeroy
Rem. § 25ti. The heir or devisee of a deceased mortgagor is a
proper party plaintifff, 47 Barb. 144. If the mortgagor has con
veyed his interest absolutely, 46 Me. 297, or assigned in bank
ruptcy, L. R. 10 Eq. 398, or his right has been sold on execution,
1 Dev. ifc B. (N. C.) Eq. 613, he need not be made a party to re
deem ; but if he has conveyed the equity of redemption by war
ranty deed, so that he is liable to discharge the mortgage, the
mortgagor should be made a party. Story Eq. PI. § 18;!. If the
mortgage is a leasehold estate, the personal representatives of the
deceased mortgagor are proper parties, Story Eq. PI. \ 170; and
if part of a mortgage in fee has been paid in the life-time of the
mortgagor, and an account is to be taken of the amount due on
the mortgage, the personal representatives should be joined
with the heir or devisee as parties plaintifff; or, in case of their
refusal to join as plaintifffs, they should be made defendants,
Jones Mortg. I 1098. The wife, in a bill to redeem her own lands,
need not join her husband, 46 Me. 297. When two tracts of land
are mortgaged to the same person to secure the same debt, and
they afterwards come into the hands of different proprietors, one
of them, it has been held, can not be redeemed without the
other. The owners of both parcels, and all persons interested,
must be made parties to the action ; and if not all as plaintifffs,
then at least as defendants, 36 Me. 50 ; but if the mortgage comes
into the hands of different persons, all connection between
them is severed, and the actions to redeem must be separate, 2
Eden 78.
Nuisance. Several parties may unite in an action to restrain a
public nuisance when speciallv injured, 1 H. 52 ; IIi. 401; 23O.S.
523 ; 4 O. 376 ; 21X516: 4 Bull 150; but not for damages, as there
is no community of interest ns to damages. Bliss Code PI. g 76.
Reptecin. Mortgagor and mortgagee of chattels can not join,
6 Bull 247; and owners of separate mortgages upon the same
chattels can not properly join, but when so joined the court
may render judgment against all. 15 Bull 125.
Specific performance. Only parties to the contract need be made
parties, ordinarily, in a suit for specific performance, 109 111. 71.
If the vendee dies, his heirs are the parties to bring the action;
his administrator, when the action is to recover damages, 19 Wis.
438; S3 la. 512, 518. If the vendor dies, his administrator must
bring the action for the price, not the heirs, 63 N. Y. 301 ; but Mr.
Bliss says even if the vendor has died without having acquired
the legal title, this will not excuse the administrator from
uniting his heirs as parties, Bliss Code PI. 1 108; 1 Hare 547. A
stranger claiming an interest under an adverse title is neither a
necessary nor proper party, Pomeroy Rem. \ 263 ; 3 My. & Cr. 63,
69; and a mere agent for the purchase and sale, although he
transacts business in his own name, is not, ordinarily, a proper
party to the suit, unless his relation to the transaction is sucn aa to make him a trustee, 21 W.Va. 656; but a person claiming
under a prior agreement is a proper party, Pomeroy Rem. § 263;
1 H. ifc M. 176; and one having acquired an interest in the sub
ject matter after the making of the contract under the vendor
and with notice of the vendee's rights, 13 Sim. 206. Purchasers
of separate tracts can not unite in an action against the vendor,
but if there is one contract of sale to several persons covering
the land, although it may have stipulated for different shares,
the purchasers may unite. 24 Cal. 171, 177 ; see § 5797-5802.
Sureties. Where several sureties pay the debt of their princi
pal, and there is no evidence of a partnership or joint interest^or
of payment from a joint fund, the presumption is thateach paid
his proportion, ana a several action will lie for its recovery from
the principal, 14 Me. 223; 20 N. H. 418; but if several sureties
pay the debt of their principal from joint funds, they may join
in an action for reimbursement, 18 Hun 141; 14 Pick. 287; and,
it is held, if the judgment is joint against the sureties, all must
join in an action against the principal, 2 O. 209 (1825). Where
sureties pay the whole debt jointly they may join in an action
against those who did not pay, for contribution, 23 Vt. 593 ; and
if one of the paying sureties has died, his executor may be joined
as one of the plaintifffs, 50 Cal. 456.
Tax-payers, Several owners of separate lots may unite to
enjoin the collection of an illegal assessment or tax, 38 O. S. 314 ;
23 O. S. 605; 24 O. S. 232; or one may sue on behalf of all simi
larly situated, 5 O. S. 364 ; 38 O. H. 314; but not when the per
sons for whom suit is brought are divisible into classes whose
rights and liabilities are not necessarily the same, 29 O. S. 500,
508. It has been held that several persons can not so unite,
though similarly situated. 10 O. 235 ; 5 Blatchf. 259. In Kansas a
distinction is drawn as to the right of action when the tax is
wholly illegal, when any number can unite to enjoin its collec
tion, 10 Kas. 326, 491, 509 ; and where it is valid and becomes ille
gal only in its application, when each person severally interested
must sue alone, 12 Kas. 140, 146, 147 ; see 29 Kas. 364. In Iowa it
is held that they cau not unite to restrain the collection of an
illegal tax, nor can one sue on behalf of others similarly situ
ated, but each must sue alone, 36 la. 413, 416-420 ; and in Wiscon
sin it has been held that they can, 21 Wis. 516, and can not join
in such action, 18 Wis. 566 ; 19 Wis. 93.
Tenants in common may join In an action for rent where they
unite in renting the property, 42 O. S. 190; and where they are
married women owning their shares as separate property their
husbands need not be joined, Id.; must join in personal actions
for injuries to the estate, 37 N. Y. 372; but if the share of one ten
ant in common is separable from that of the others, he may sue
for the conversion ol his share, 77 N. Y. 158. It is held that they
are not required to join in an action for possession, 16 S. C. 220;
nor in an action to set aside deeds severally made by them, 28
Kus. 174. Under the New York statute they may sue jointly or
separately in ejectment, 41 N. Y. 219, where such an action
might be maintained by all, Code Civ. Pro. § 1500. Ejectment lies
by one excluded from possession by the other, 2 O. 110 ; 19 O. 218 ;
or against a stranger, W. 330. Mortgagors, tenants in common,
can not sue the mortgagee separately for their share of the pro
ceeds at a foreclosure sale after satis'faction of the debt, S. C. 
§5006
Trespass. Tenants in common should join in trespass, 13
Johns. 287 ; one may sue alone as against a stranger, 42 Vt. 679.
Trustees may maintain trespass when the legal title is in them,
26 Me. 512. Where a will leaves real estate to a widow and heirs
in certain proportions, the heirs may maintain the action with
out joining the widow, 2 Clev. Rep. 81.
Trust. Generally, in actions hytrustees, the beneficiaries must
join as plaintifffs or defendants, Pomeroy Rem. § 260 ; see 5 Rec.
285; 1 Bull 300; but in actions by trustees of an express trust,
§4995, and in suits between the trustees themselves, brought by
one to compel the other to account and restore the trust prop
erty misappropriated by him, the beneficiaries need not be made
parties, Story Eq. PI. § 213. If the cestuis que trustent have con
curred in the breach, they must be joined in a suit brought by
one trustee against his co-trustee, Pomeroy Rem. § 260. where a
trustee sues merely to recover possession of the trust property
from a third party the cestui que trust is not a necessary party to
the suit, 22 Fed. Rep. 13 ; but where a bill filed by trustees seeks
the sale of real estate vested in them in trust, and they have not
a present absolute power of disposition over their estate, accord
ing to the terms of the trust, their cestuis que trustent are necessary
parties, 39 N. J. Eq. 545. Several trustees must unite in actions
brought by them, 33 How.Pr. 145; and if one of several trustees
refuses to join, his co-trustees may maintain the action, making
him a party defendant, 78 N. Y. 224. When an estate is conveyed
to trustees'jointly a right of survivorship exists, and suit may be
maintained in the name of the survivor, 54 Miss. 117. Upon the
death of a trustee pending suit, the action may be revived in
the name of his executor, 14 Ala. 707.
§ 5006. Joinder of defendants. Any person may be
made a defendant who has or claims an interest in the
controversy adverse to the plaintifff, or who is a neces
sary party to a complete determination or settlement of
a question involved therein. [51 v. 57, \ 35 ; S. & C. 955.]
Account. Creditors may be joined with the heir in an action
against an administrator for an account, 1 Ii. 497. In an action
for an account a judgment creditor of plaintifff is a necessary
party when the answer sets up that he has garnished the claim,
34 O. S, 294.
Agent. The principal can not have a joint claim against
agent and persons contracting through him, 1 D. 156, 158. A
sub-agent of an insurance company must join the agent with the
company as defendants in an action for his part of the commis
sions, 27 O. S. 393.
Animals. A joint action will not lie against the owners of a
herd of cattle for trespasses committed by such stock where
each person owns a several and distinct portion, 46 la. 45 ; but
separate owners of animals may be sued jointly for trespasses
committed by them when kept in common, 25 O. S. 255, and
under the joint control of all the owners, 70 111. 292, and several
owners of dogs may be sued jointly in an action for injury to
sheep, 24 O. S. 333 (S. & S. 10); see 1 W. L. M. 198, 389. Under the
present statute they are, jointly and severally, liable for killing,
worrying
or injuring

Assignment
fw creditors.
an action
by attaching of a firm against an assignee for the benefit of creditors, partner
ship creditors are not necessary parties, 29 O. S. 441. Where one
of the makers of a joint note has assigned for the benefit of
creditors, the remaining solvent parties need not be joined in
an action against the assignee to compel an allowance of the
notes, 2 Bull 246.
Assignor. In an action by the assignee of a judgment to sub
ject equities of the debtor, the assignor who is indebted to
defendant is a necessary party, 24 O. S. 204; and an assignor
is a necessary party when unliquidated damages on a con
tract are set off by the assignee, 3 W. L. M. 151 ; in a suit to
quiet title where the assignments are conflicting, 3 W. L. M. 593;
in an action by an assignee of an insurance policy for reforma
tion and enforcement, 2 Bull 223; and an assignor of a nonnegotiable note was formerly a necessary party in an action by
the assignee, 2 W. L. M. 420; and an assignor was a necessary
party in an action on a mortgage, but non-joinder was waived
if not objected to, 2 W. L. M. 543; but see mortgage, 8 O. S. 2;
20 O. 474. An assignor of an account as collateral security is not
a necessary party to a suit brought against the debtor by the
assignee, 1 1 O. S. 374, 377, 378 ; but an assignor of part of a claim
is a necessary party, 13 O. S. 495, 501 ; and in an action by the
assignee of the right to commissions on renewals conveyed by
the agent of an insurance company, the assignor is a necessary
party, 27 O. S. 393, 396.
Aitachmrnt. In an action by plaintifffin attachment against a
garnishee to recover money due from him to the defendant in
attachment, the latter, who claims to have selected and to hold
the same exempt from being applied to the payment of the
plaintifff's claim, is a proper party to the action, 36 O. S. 545.
A subsequent attaching creditor is not a proper party to an
action by a prior attaching creditor, on the ground of interest
acquired by levy of attachment on the same property, 9 O. S.
388 ; 12 O. S. 158. A garnishee in an action before a justice of the
peace who is summoned to answer is not a party, 39 O. S. 218.
Mortgagee is not a proper party where equity of redemption is
attached, 33 O. K. 254. Weiendant's wife not, 20 Bull 471.
Attorney against whom no fraud is charged or relief sought
should not be joined in a proceeding to restrain the enforce
ment of a judgment for fraud, 2 Kelly, 325 ; but should be joined
if charged with being a party to the fraud, 17 Cal. 467.
Bills and note?. Joint makers should be sued jointly, Pomeroy Rem. §277. Those severally liable upon the same instrument
may be included in the same action at the option of the plaintifff,
5 O. S. 586 ; § 5009. A guarantor (payee) and maker may be sued
jointly, 26 O. S. 3:i0, and the survivor and personal representative
of a deceased jointmakcr may be joined in the same action, § 6102 ;

obligors of a joint and several official bond the personal repre
sentatives of the deceased principal are not necessary parties,2f>
O. S. 620. A devisee and executor may be joined in an action on a bond of a deceased surety 27 O. S. 39ft. In an action on an
executor's bond under § 6215 the heirs, legatees, devisees.widow,
or next of kin, or others who may be liable on account of assets
coming into their hands, may be made defendants. In an action
on a bond given by a partner to a retiring partner to pay firm
debts, firm creditors may be joined as defendants, 9 O. S. 4*17.
Contractor. Joint contractors must be joined, 5 O.514; 23
O. S. 543. Iu an action against a city for damages caused by the
construction of a sewer, the contractor can not be joined with,
the city, 2 C. S. C. R. 158. In an action against the authorities of
a city to restrain them from giving a contract to one not the low
est bidder, neither the contractor nor bidders are proper purties,
32 Barb. 37.
Debtor and creditor. Creditors are not necessary parties when
represented by an assignee for the benefit of creditors, 29 O. S.
441. A judgment creditor is a necessary party where the answer
sets up that he has garnished the claim, 34 O. S. 294. Debtors of
defendant can not be joined in an action to recover a judgment
against him, 1 H. 281.
Dower. Several separate owners can not be joined, 10 O. 127 ;
8 O. 418.

38 Barb. 25.
Executors and administrators are necessary parties in an action
to enforce the payment of a claim against an estate, 45 Cal. 491 ;
to charge real estate of decedent in the hands of heirs with the
payment of debts, 5 O. 555 ; to subject assets devised for the pay
ment of debts, 2 Duval 123 ; when a bill is filed for an account of
the personal assets of decedent, 60 Barb. 372 ; to recover a legacy
or distributive share of the estate, 2 Mtirph 336; (and the action
may be brought against an executor, without joining his co-ex
ecutor, when he has in his hands the balance remaining for dis
tribution, 20 O. 310;) in an action for a pension, 11 O. S. 214;
when charged with, assets, or fraud or collusion is charged
between executors, 1 Green Ch. 74 ; when the fund sought to be
distributed is in the hands of adverse claimants and the bill is
filed for its recovery and distribution, 37 Ala. 93. The adminis
trator and heirs of a deceased mortgagor should be joined as
defendants in a bill to redeem, 8 O. 44 ; in specific performance
against heirs on their ancestor's contract to convey lauds, when
damages are sought, 8 O. 377. An administrator of a minor
receiving payment of a judgment obtained by the guardian is a
necessary party to enjoin its collection, W. 390 ; see Bond.
Gaming. Players and owners of premises can not be joined in
an action to recover money lost at gaming, 2 C. S. C. R. 12; and
separate owners can not ba joined, 6 Bull
Guarantor. In thisstateaguarantorand principal debtor may

Pomeroy Rem. § 409 ; with some exceptions, 30 la. 414 ; 11 la. 371 ;
24 la. 334. A guarantor (payee) of a note may be sued jointly
with the maker, 26 O. S. 330; and a guarantor of a subscription
may be joined with the subscriber in an action on it, 31 O. S. 15 ;
see Id. 41. Where a guaranty of payment of a debt was made by
husband and a wife having a separate estate, the wife and hus
band's administrator, but not the husband's heirs, were held
proper parties defendant in an action on it, 6 Bull 288.
Heirs should be joined with administrator in bill to redeem,
8 O. 44 (1837), and in foreclosure, 1 D. 36 ; must be parties in
administrator's sale, 12 O. 253 (1833); in specific performance
when damages are sought, 8 O. 377. They are not necessary
defendants in action by the executor for sale of premises for
unpaid purchase money, 30 O. S. 491, 501 ; and when lands are
directed by will to be sold and converted into money, the exec
utor, and not the heir, is a necessary party to a suit concerning
the disposition and charges on such estate, 83 N. C. 569. A joint
action against several heirs, or devisees, can not be sustained
under the act of 1831 when there is no joint contract either ex
press or implied, 15 O. 338. In suits relating to the homestead,
brought by the widow, the heir is a proper party, 43 Mich. 582.
Landlord and tenant. A lessee and one who guarantees the
payment of the rent in the same instrument may be sued jointly
in the same action, 23 N. Y. 286; 11 la. 323. Several tenants in
common possession of stock may be jointly sued for trespasses
committed by such stock, though the animals are owned by
them separately, 25 O. S. 256.
Legatee necessary party to a bill to set aside a will, 35 O. S. 642.
All legatees are necessary parties in a suit by one claiming as
residuary legatee. 4 Johns. Cb. 202; but not in a suit to recover
a specific legacy, Id. When the question arises aa to the lapse
of a legacy, a residuary legatee should be made a party, and a
debtor legatee when the question arises as to whether or not his
debt was discharged by the gift of the legacy, 27 N. J. Eq. 136.
Assignors of a legacy who have disposed of all their interest are
not necessary parties to a suit by an assignee, 2 Green Ch. 53.
When decedent holding funds in trust specifically bequeaths
them, the legatee is not a necessary party to a suit for their
recovery brought against the executor, 14 Wis. 23S.
Liquor laws. Two or more persons jointly selling liquor
under the act 1854, are jointly or severally liable, 20 O. S. 48 ; and
two or more persons severally selling liquor are jointly liable,
40 O. S. 43. The act of 1854 amended, 07 v. 102, provides that "a
wife . . . who shall be injured ... in means of support . . .
in consequence of the intoxication, or otherwise of any person,
shall have a right of action in her name, severally or jointly,
against any person or persons who shall, by selling or giving
intoxicating liquors, have caused the intoxication in whole or
in part."
Master and servant can not be sued jointly, 8 O. S. 359 ; 2 C. S.
C. R. 158; 7 O. S. 226; unless the work is in itself unlawful or
necessarily injurious to third persons, 1 D. 327, 330; 34 O. S. 638;
8 O. S. 359.
Mechanic's lien. The owner is the only necessary party de
fendant, 25 N. J. Eq. ii92; see 1 C. C. R. 30. Subsequent incum
brancers are proper parties, 43 Md. 134 ; a contractor, 50 Mo. 159 ;
I sooe
or sub-contractor, 54 Cal. 219 ; but a contractor is not a necessary
party in an action against the owner, 65 Ind. 867; and a mere
agent need not be joined, 54 Cal. 219. An owner who has trans
ferred his interest subsequently to the contract for labor and
materials is not a necessary party when no personal judgment
is demanded, 81 11I. 183; or proper party, 37 Ind. 1H8; and a prior
lienholder need not be made a party, 46 Md. 578. The wife must
be made a party to enforce a mechanic's lien on the homestead,
46 Wis. 130. If tne owner die, his administrator is a neces
sary party where suit is against the heir to enforce the lien, 3
Bradf. (N. Y.) 54; and where the owner has sold the property,
taking a mortgage to secure the purchase money, his admlnls*
trator, on his death, and not the heirs, are to be made parties
with the present owner, 24 la. 298.
Mortgage. Foreclosure. The ownerof the equity of redemption
is a necessarv party defendaut, 10 Paige 409; in case of his death,
his heir; 1 6. S. 369; 4 Hull 479; though the mortgage be of a
term of vears, 13 Ves. 231; and his personal representatives,
1 D. 36 (where the statute made the equity of redemption de
scendible to the personal representatives, 15 O. 735; and see 8 O.
446. The general rule is that the personal representatives are
only necessary parties when a personal judgment for a deficiencv is sought against the estate. Bliss Code PI. § 102; Story
Eq. PI. II 175, 196); his devisees, 2 Hen. & M. (Va.) 6; 7 Paige
547; his legatees when legacies are made a special charge upon
the mortgaged estate, 6 Johns. Ch. 450; otherwise they are not
necessary parties, 60 How. Pr. 185 ; in case of bankruptcy, his
assignee, 47 N. Y. 261; 90 N. Y. 538; see 31 O. S. 158; unless the
assignment is made pending suit, 55 N. Y. 652. In case he has
conveyed it, his grantee, 10 Paige 499; 10 O. S. 339 (several pur
chasers from the mortgagor may be joined, W. 729); and the
grantee of a portion of the premises who has assumed the pay
ment of the purchase money is a necessary party, 41 O. S. 143;
after his death his heir, 1 Iud. 35. When the wife has joined in
the execution of the mortgage she is a necessary party if it is
de«ired to bar her rights, 15 O. S. 485; 16 O. S. 193; 28 O. S. 503;
and if she did not, a proper one, 20 N. Y. 412; where she has a
defense to the claim, 38 Wis. 408; but if she did not join in the
mortgage and has no defense to the claim she is not a proper
party, 55 N. Y. 7 ; see 28 O. S. 32. When it is sought to foreclose
the homestead right, the wife should be made a party, 10 Cal.
296 ; but if the mortgage is made before marriage, she is not, in
such case, a necessary, and, it seems, not a proper party, 29 O. S.
636; and she is not a necessary party in an action to foreclose a
mortgage executed by the husband, in which she did not join, to
secure the purchase price, 2 C. C. R. 70; see 22 O. S. 435. Cestuit
que trustent in the foreclosure of a mortgage given by trustees
are necessarv parties, 2 Sandf. Ch. 562; but when the beneficia
ries are numerous, 2 Johns. Ch. 197 ; where the trust is for the
benefit of creditors and the trustee has the legal estate, 9 Johns.
591. they arc not necessary parties. Tenant* in common must be
joined when the mortgage is made by them, 3 J. J. Marsh 301.
Partners should be joined, and at common law their heirs or
personal representatives are not necessary parties, since the title
vests in the surviving partner on the death of one, 1 Ala. 126;
but in this state, under § 6102, the survivors might be joined
with the personal representatives. Where there are estates in remainder or reversion after a life estate in the equity of redemp
tion, only the holders of the life estates and the first person in
being having a vested estate of inheritance need be joined, 2
Edw. Ch. 127 ; 7 Paige 544. A lessee of a term of years, where
the lease is subsequent to the mortgage, should be made a party,
8 N. Y. 44 ; and an occupant or tenant in possession, McMull.
Eq. (S. C.) 157, 106; butithasbeen held not an occupant with
out title, 10 la. 517. If the mortgagor has conveyed his equity of
redemption absolutely, and no personal judgment is asked, he
is not a necessary nor proper party, 84 Mich. 10; 21 la. 36; 53
Cal. 375 ; but if he has conveyed only a portion of the premises,
27 la. 214, or if he retain an interest in the property by reason
of irregularity of sale under a subsequent mortgage, 48 Ala. 87,
he is a necessary party ; and if he has conveyed the premises
by warranty deed, 15 la. 34; 21 la. 36 (Mr. Jones says these
cases are not generally sustained, § 1403), or if a personal judg
ment is sought against him, 22 N. J. Eq. 478, he is a proper party.
A mortgagee who has assigned his interest absolutely in file
mortgage need not be made a party, 8 O. S. 1 ; 20 O. 474 ; 8 W. L.
J. 371 ; but when he has assigned it as collateral security, 12 N. Y.
495, and still retains an interest in it, he should be made a party.
Where several notes secured by a mortgage are assigned, an
assignee can not unite as co-plaintifffs the holders of the other
notes in an action to foreclose, on account of the severance of the
debt and of the interests of the holders, but either holder may
foreclose, making the other holders defendants, 9 la. 297 ; 45
Tex. 628. Subsequent mortgagees and encumbrancers are proper
but not necessary parties, 61 How. Pr. 43 ; Pomeroy Rem. | 342 ;
Jones Mortg. § 1425 (Mr. Wiltsie says they are necessary parties,
but he does not seem to make the distinction between proper
and necessary parties recognized by other writers, Wiltsie on
Parties in Foreclosure, § 61); and subsequent judgment credit
ors of the mortgagor having a lien upon the property, 10 N. Y.
356 ; but mesne purchasers who have conveyed their interests,
unless they have assumed the payment of the mortgage, 45 Cal.
584; 3 Edw. (N.Y.)472; purchasers and encumbrancers pendente
lite, 4 Sandf. Ch. 381 ; persons claiming title adversely to the
mortgagor, % U. S. 340, and prior encumbrancers, Jones Mortg.
31439; Pomeroy Rem. §334,342; Wiltsie on Parties in Foreclosure
§ 116 (that they are proper parties, Bates PI. pp. 583, 584; Bliss
Code PI. \\ 100, 101), are neither necessary nor proper parties. A
guarantor of the mortgage debt, 11 Mich. 155 (unless he has
guaranteed that the mortgage debt is collectible, 9 Paige 90);
and the maker of a note secured by a mortgage executed by
another, 18 Cal. 491, or indorser or assignor, 47 Ind. 326; contra,
24 Cal. 379, unless a personal judgment is sought, are not neces
sary or proper parties. Where a senior mortgagee forecloses his
mortgage and sells the property without making the junior
mortgagee a party, the rights of the junior mortgagee remain
unaffected and are not prejudiced by such foreclosure, 30 O. S.
24; and the same rule applies where a junior mortgagee
has assigned ail his interest in the mortgage, and the notes
secured thereby, to a third person who is not a party and is
without notice of such proceedings, 43 O. S. 437 ; and though the
assignee did not take a written assignment of the junior mort
gage, nor obtain from the mortgagor a quit claim deed of his
equity of redemption and have the same recorded, he is not estopped from foreclosing the same, Id. Redemption. Mortgagee*
and assignees in whim is vested the legal title are neewwary
parties, 19 Ala. 213; a id if a mortgagee has assigned hi* interest
as collateral security, or assigned part of his interest, he is still
a necessary party as is his assignee, 47 N. Y. 261. If he ha* made
an absolute conveyance of the estate as security, his grantee
must be joined with him, 4 Paige 2j9; and if the mortgage
has been conveyed upon trusts declared, the trustee and cewtut
que trust should be made parties, 3 Mad. 2j5. On the death of
the mortgagee his administrator is the only necessary lwrty, 3H
Mo. 349. A junior mortgagee must make the mortgagor or other
representative of the realty a party, and the prior mortgagees as
well, Jones Mortg. §1102, and the person to whom the mortgage
note has been transferred without assignment of the mortgage
should be made a party to the bill, 46 Me. 445. A mortgagee who
has assigned his mortgage note as collateral security for nis own
debt must be made a party to the bill as well as the person who
received such assignment, 53 Me. 246. A devisee of the mort
gagee in trust should be joined with the cestui que trust in an
aetion by the mortgagor alter condition broken lor relinquish
ment of their interest in the mortgaged premises, 24 O. S. 97.
JfisceHawous. A mortgagor and purchaser of fixtures should bo
joined in a suit by the mortgagee, 24 O. S. 3G9. Where money is
advanced to parties holding a contract for a lot on the security
of it, in a bill to enforce the security, the owners of the lot are
necessary parties, W. 338. A bill seeking to obtain payment of a
debt secured by mortgage is not multifarious, because it covers
several tracts sold to various purchasers, making them all parties,
W. 729. A mortgagee is a necessary party to an action by an
executor or administrator to get possession of land fraudulently
conveyed by decedent, i 6142; 19 O. S. 472; he was not prior to
1858, 11 O. S. 486; see 3 C. C. R. 144.
Municipal corporation. A necessary party in an action to
restrain the collection of an assessment for laying sidewalk, 10
Kas. 510 ; not a necessary party in an action by a contractor on
private contract with property holders to improve street, 4 Bull
909 ; 8 Rec. 357.
Quiet title. All persons necessary to a complete settlement of
the aetion may be properly made parties, 18 la. 303. The holder
of the legal title in trust and cestui que trust must be joined, 24
O. S. 97. An assignor, where the assignments are conflicting, is a
necessary party, 3 W. L. M. 593; but an auditor applying j,ayment of tax to the wrong land is not a proper party, 2 W. L. G.
315.
Reformation. When a contract is sought to be reformed on the
ground of mistake, all persons interested should be made parties,
75 111. 423. If a misdescription, running through the deeds of
several prior grantors, is sought to be corrected, such grantors,
or, if dead, their heirs, should be made parties, 24 la. 486. If the
grantee has sold a portion of the premises thus misdescribed,
and followed the misdescription in his conveyance, he should
in seeking relief from his grantor make such grantee a party, 60
m. 307 ; but a county recorder who correctly copied the deed of
record is not a proper party to the suit, 44 Ind. 221. In an action
by an assignee of au insurance policy for reformation and
enforcement the assignor is a necessary party, 2 Bull 223.
Rescission and cancellation. In an action against a vendor ana vendee to set aside and cancel a deed, both defendants are neces
sary parties, though not united in intetest within the meaning
of g 4987, 39 O. S. 563. When a conveyance is sought to be set
aside on the ground that it is fraudulent as to creditors, the
grantor is properly made a party, 44 la. 356; but if he be dead,
his administrator is not a necessary party, 51 Mo. 259, and the
heirs of tiie grantor are not necessary parties, 75 Va. 114. The
grantees should be made parties whether fraud is charged or
not, 40 la. 4(10, 406. unless they have conveyed their interest in
the premises, 64 Mo. 292; and the heirs of the grantee should be
joined, 4 Heisk569. The executor and heirs of a deceased vendor
are necessary parties to an action by the vendee in an executor's
contract to sell realty seeking to rescind and to recover back the
purchase money, 4 W. L. G. 352. In an action to set aside an
award for misconduct of arbitrators, the arbitrators are not
proper parties, 29 Barb. 465. A sheriff is not a necessary nor
proper party in an action to set aside a deed of land given by
him upon a sale under execution against plaintifff, 15 Iud. 155.
Sheriff not a proper party to enjoin levy of execution under a
judgment, 1 C. S. C. R. 259, though the judgmentcreditor resides
in another counts 1 Clev. Rep. 352, unless fraud or collusion is
charged, 14 O. 445. In replevin against him for chattel mortgage
property, attaching creditor may be joined as defendant, 20 O. S.
38; 1 H. 188.
Slander and libel. There is no joint action for slander—two
defendants can not be joined—1 O. 36, 46 ; 38 la. 358; 4 Bull 596;
2 Clev. Rep. 200 ; but all concerned in the publication of a libel
may be joined as defendants, 2 Abb. Pr. 430, PomeroyRem. § 813.
Specific performance. The parties to the contract themselves,
or the persons who have become substituted in their place as
heirs, and under certain circumstances executors or administra
tors, are the only proper parties plaintifff or defendant, Pomeroy
Rem. § 366. When the vendee dies and the vendor sues for spe
cific performance the personal representatives are defendants,
since they pay the purchase money ; but the heirs are necessary
defendants, since the conveyance by the vendor will be made to
them, Story Eq. PI. 100, 177 ; but if the vendee has devised all
his interest in the contract, the devisees are necessary co-defend
ants with the personal representatives, Id.; 6 Johns. Ch. 402.
When the vendor dies and the action is brought againstthe heirs,
the personal representatives must be defendants when damages
are sought, 8 O. 377; and in an action to recover compensation
in lieu of speci fie performance, on the ground that specific per
formance has become impracticable, the real representatives -of
the deceased vendor are necessary parties, 38 O. S. 331. A third
person to whom the vendor has contracted to sell the land is a
necessary party, 4 Lans. 132; and an assignee in bankruptcy of
the vendor when the consideration has not been paid, 65 N. C.
§ 34; and mortgagees and judgment creditors of the vendor, 4
Minn. 141, and a grantee of the vendor with notice of plaintifff's
rights, 33 N. Y.058, and intermediate parties who have acquired
an interest in the land by assignment, etc., 2 A. K. Marsh 497,
unless they have absolutely parted with their interest, 14 Gray
511, are proper parties. In an action to enforce a contract for
the sale of land by a cestui que trust, the trustee must be made a
party defendant, 7 Wis. 574; but an objection to the decree on
the ground of his non-joinder will not avail if the vendee is content with the title, 10 O. 215. Where a husband, holding land
in trust lor his wile, contracted to sell it at her request, it ni
held that she need not be made a party, 18 O. S. 126. A wife
signing a contract for the sale of real estate with her husband
should not be joined with him in an action for specific perform
ance, 1 H. 19, 21. An assignor of a title bond held as collateral
has been held a necessary party in specific performance by the
assignee, W. 706; tee U 5797-5802 ; 8 C. C. R. 3L
Stockhotder. In an action to enforce the individual liability of
stockholders, all the stockholders must be united as defeudaiiu,
§3260 ; 41 O. S. 78. Any stockholder may insist that all stock
holders be made parties, 17 O. S. 86; 17 O. S. 113; and before the
enactment of § 3260 it was held that the corporation should t*;a
party, 17 O. S. 113. Solvent assignees of stock prior to the judg
ment against the corporation are necessary parties, 37 O. S. 26.
In a suit by a stockholder to subject to the claims of creditors
and stockholders assets in the hands of a trustee of the corpo
ration, appointed to settle up its affairs, the corporation or Its
legal representativesare necessary parties, 2 C. S. C. R, 19. Where
the charter of a company provided that the directors were to
levy an amount necessary to pay just claims on the stockholders
pro rata, and that such assessments should be collected by action
if not paid within sixty days after notice, such stockholders can
not bejoined in a suitagainst the company, 1 H. 217; see 44O. S.333.
Sureties. See §g 5845, 5846. A surety suing for contribution need
not join his co-sureties, 2 C. S. C. R. 64. The general rule is that
all co-sureties must be made defendants in an action by a surety
for contribution and the personal representatives of any that
are dead, and also the principal debtor, Story Eq. PI. \ loon ; 7 B.
Mon.299 ; 4 Jones Eq. 455 ; butan insolvent principal and insolv
ent co-sureties need not bejoined, 65 111. 425; nor a surety out
of the jurisdiction, 6 Ired. Eq. 115; nor a creditor of the surety
suing, to whom payment was made, 31 O. S. 406; but under
§ 5845 to compel the principal to pay the debt the creditorwould
be a necessary party, 31 O. S. 565. Sureties on the bond of execu
tors or administrators are not necessary parties to compel them
to account before the amount is liquidated, 1 I). 497, 600. A
devisee and executor may be joined in an action on the bond of
a deceased surety, 27 O. S. 398
Tax. See %\ 5849,5850. When the owner of school lands seeks
to enjoin the collection of and to have a tax levied upon such
lands declared void, the county is a proper party to the proceed
ing, 21 Wis. 689. A city is a necessary party to a bill seeking to
restrain the collection of city assessments for the pavment of
sidewalks made in front of lots within its limits, 10 Kas. 510.
A school district is a necessary party to a suit to restrain the col
lection of a tax levied for the purpose of paying interest on
school-district bonds and to create a fund for the redemption of
the bonds, 17 Kas. 361. In asuit by a stockholder to restrain the
illegal taxation of a corporation the corporation must be a party,
it having refused to bring the suit, 18 Wall. 626.
Trust. In an action to set aside a trust deed, the beneficiaries
need not be joined, Pomeroy Rem. \ 357; 4 Minn. 315; 25 Mo.
156 ; 93 U. S. 155 ; but in an action to enforce a trust, or settle it,
the beneficiaries must bejoined as plaintifffs or defendants, 28
How. Pr. 92; 22 O.S. 208 ; 7 Bull 113; sec 36 O. S. 17 ; and this is the
general rule, except in the case of administrators and executors or assignees for the benefit of creditors, Story Eq. PI. \\ 192, 193,
207 ; or where the beneficiaries are numerous, Id. § 118, 150. A
trustee is a necessary party to an action to enforce the perform
ance of an ixpress trust, 9 la. 261 ; but if he has been divested
of, 22 O. S. 208, or has parted with, his title, he is not a neces
sary party, 41 O. S. 368 ; and if he has absolutely assigned it the
assiguee alone should be sued, unless the assignment was a
breach of trust, Story Eq. PL 211, 213, 214. In an action by
beneficiaries for a breach of trust, all the trustees should be par
ties, Story Eq. -PI. § 210, unless the breach of trust is in the
nature of a tort, where there is no liability to contribution, or
where the party omitted is a nominal trustee, having been dis
charged, or having disclaimed, Bliss Code PI. § 109a; Perry on
Trusts §876; or where one seeks an account of so much of the
trust fund as is in thehandsof a particular trustee, or where the
petitiou otherwise shows that such omitted parties have no
interest in the controversy, Bliss Code PI. \ 109a. In case of a
joint breach of trust the representatives maybe joined with the
survivors, 19 Fed. Rep. 471; see 53 N. Y. 483, 490. In actions to
enforce a lien on or to reach property impressed with an implied
trust, the person in whom the legal title is vested is a necessary
Jiarty, Pomeroy Rem. § 359 ; 31 Ind. 106; but in enforcing a claim
or services rendered a trust estate, the cestui que trust is not a
necessary party, 8 Hun 4; 69 N Y. 609. Assignees of an idemnity
trust deed may pursue the trust fund against the heirs of a
deceased grantor without making the widow, personal repre
sentative or assignor a party. 16 O. 66. Persons havingau equity
in lands or contract with the trustee of military land-warrants
are necessary parties to a suit in chancery by the cestui que use
to compel the legal title to such warrants and entries and sur
veys under the same, 14 O. 109 ; see Id. 323.
Unincorporated lodge or association. All the members are
proper parties, 4 Bull 513 ; see 2 C. C. R. 340.
§ 5007. Parties refusing to join as plaintifffs made de
fendants. Parties who are united in interest must be
joined, as plaintifffs or defendants; but if the consent of
one who should have been joined as plaintifff can not be
obtained, or, if he is insane, and the consent of his
guardian can not be obtained, or he has no guardian,
and that fact is stated in the petition, he may be made a
defendant. [51 v. 57, \ 36 ; S. & C. 956.]
See § 4993 ; 11 O. S. 374 ; 38 Cal. 514 ; Bliss Code PI. U n, 78 ;
Bates PI. p. 33.
§ 5008, When one or more may sue or defend for all.
When the question is one of a common or general inter
est of many persons, or when the parties are very nu
merous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before
the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit
of all. [51 v. 57, \ 37 ; S. & O. 957.]
See I 5005 (Injunction—Tax-payer). One may sue on behalf of
others similarly situated to restrain the collection of an alleged
O. 235 ; bat when it appears that those represented ore divisible
into classes whose rights and liabilities are not necessarily the
same, he can only act on behalf of those of his own class, 29 O. S.
560,508; and if ihe party named as plaintifff who sues on behalf
of himself and others fails in his suit, those whom he represents
must also fail, Id. 510. One may sue on behalf of himself and
others to foreclose a railroad mortgage, 35 O. S. 307, 315; to en
force the statutory liability of stockholders, 17 O. S. 113; and in
7i'o warranto, 22 O. S. 411, 426; see 19 O. S. 78; 1'omeroy Rem.
^38*-4)l;B.issCk)dj PI. ^78,81; Bates PL 38 ; 2 C. C. R. 241.
ji 5009. Persons severally liable. One or more of the
persons severally liable on an instrument may be included
in the same action thereon. [51 v. 57, \ 38 ; S. & C. 957.]
See \ 5005 (Bills and notes—Guarantor). As a guarantor (payee)
and maker of a note. 26 O. S. 330; 7 Kos. 331 ; 11 la. 371 ; 21 la.
331; contra, 9 Neb. 417; 60 Ind. 350; 2 Duer 626; u guarantor of
a subscription and subscriber, 31 O. S. 15; or may be sued sep
arately, Id. 41 ; a guarantor of payment of rent may be sued
jointly with the lessee, 11 la. 323 ; contra, 15 Ind. 144 ; when the
guaranty is included in and made part of the original agree
ment, 23 N. Y. 286. In this state the survivor and personal rep
resentatives of a deceased obligor may be joined in the same
action whether the contract be joint or several, '( 6102, 5 O. S. 588;
42 O. S. 302 ; generally, 3 C. II. R. 620, 624.
§ 5010. Parties to written instrument by initial letter.
Parties to a written instrument by initial letter, or aeontraction of the name, may be so designated in an action
thereon. [51 v. 397, § 1 ; S. & C. 1139.]
7 Neb. 245.
§ 5011. How partners may sue or be sued. A partner
ship formed for the purpose of carrying on a trade or
property therein, may
sue or be sued by the usual or ordinary name which it
has assumed, or by which it is known ; and in such case it
shall not be necessary to allege or prove the names of the
individual members thereof. [44 v. 66, \ 1 ; S. & C. 1 138.]
See \\ 5042, 5381. Actions by partners. A partnership suing in
its firm name must bring Itself within the provisions of this
section, and an omission to do so is ground of demurrer, 13 O. S.
210, 216 (see 4 W. L. M. 25, act 1846). Unless the action cun be
brought in the firm name all the members must join in a suit
for
the collection
of aofpartner<hip
O. 132
; as for
recovery•
of the price
goods sold claim,
by the20firm,
1 Daly
416;the
10
How. Pr. 102. However numerous the members, 5 Abb. N. Cas.
102, one can not sue on behalf of himself and others, 1 C. S. C. R.
331 ; as in an action against an inn-keeper for loss of goods, 1
E. D. Smith 51 ; in an action for damages for deceit in the pur
chase of real estate for partnership purposes, 6 Met. 246; in an
action for libel published concerning them In their joint bust-ness, 1 Chitty PI. 64. All except dormant, 20 0. 132, and retiring
partners, 27 O. S. 1, must join ; though it has been held under
the code that a dormant partner is a necessary party plaintifff, 4
Duer 416 ; contra, 49 Barb. 403. In case of insolvency actions to
collect partnership demands should be in the name of the solv
ent partner and the assignee or the purchaser at execution sale,
Bliss Code PI. §056; ana likewise in case of voluntary assign
ment of the partnership interest. Id. j! 65c. In case of dissolution
the action should be in the name ot all the partners in settling
up the partnership affairs, Bates PI. p. 647. Where one of the
partners has died the right of action remains in the surviving
partners without joining the administrator of the deceased part
ner, 10 O. 455.
Actions between partners. Partners can not, in general, sue
each other during the existence of the partnership relation,
1 E. D. Smith 215; W. 764; or the firm of which they are mem
bers, W. 220, for any of the business or undertakings of the
firm, 5 Cal. 300, unless there has been an account and ascertained
balance. 19 O. 44; 26 O. S. 567,570; 11 Bull 199 ; W. 764; Pomeroy
Rem. 3 104; or an express promise, 12 O. 300; 5 O. 514; Pomeroy
Rem. g 104. One partner may, thereforee, sue another for dam
ages sustained by a breach of the partnership agreement, 12
Hun 15; 18 O. 532 (those who have sold out their interest before
the matter in controversy arose need not be made parties, 18 O.
532); for damages caused by premature dissolution on breach of
partnership articles, 6 Seld. 489 ; for a breach of promise to ad
vance capital, 5 O. 514. One partner may sue another on con
tracts distinct from the partnership business, 12 Nev. 225; for
torts not connected with the firm, Collyer on Ptshp. § 404. And
one firm may sue another, having a mutual partner, for an ascer
tained balance. 18 N.Y. 74; see 4\y. L. G. 81 ; 2D. 499; and such
mutual partner may elect to be plaintifffor defendant, 18 N.Y. 74 ;
and when one who is a member of two firms makes a promis
sory note in the name of one firm payable to a person who is a
member of the other firm, the payee may sue and recover upon
it at law, 12 O. 300. After a settlement each must sue separately
for his share. Two can not join in an action against one, 17 O). S.
323. The fact that the cause of action is not joint but several in
its character constitutes a good defense; and where such defect
appears upon the face of the petition it may be demurred to, but
the right to make such defense by answer is not waived by a
failure so to demur, 17 O. S. 323. Where a retiring partner took
a bond from his late partner conditioned to pay firm debts, the
firm's creditors wereheld necessary parties in an action by such
retiring partner against the obligors of the bond, 9 O. S. 467.
Actions against partners. An action may be brought against a
partnership in its firm name, provided it is formed for the pur
pose of carrying on a business within the state or holding prop
erty therein, 13 O.S. 210; 18 O. S. 134 (Proceeding in garnishment).
A foreign partnership does notcome within the provisions of the
statute, 1 H. IKS; but if in an action against it in its firm name a
verdict against it is taken without objection to the irregularity it
will be held to have waived the objection. Id. The court may In
its discretion permit an amendment of the petition. Id., but the
process can not be amended, 1 H. 674; and an amendment sub
stituting individual names requires a new service, 2 D. 686.
When the action can not be brought against the firm in its firm name, it must be brought against all the partners. For a tort
arising from the act or negligence of one partner in the course
of the partnership business all the members are liable as part
ners, 58 N. Y. 613; 49 Ala. 121. PIaintiff may treat the tort aa
several, and sue all or any of the tort feasors, 12 Rich. BOO. All
except dormant partners should be made deicndauts, 31 Md. 179.
Dormant partners, it is held, may be joined, 8 H. L. C. 268; but
their non-joinder will not be ground of plea in abatement when
plaintifff did not know of their existence, 19 Wend. 525. Upon
thedeathof a partner his personal representatives and the sur
vivor may be joined in the action, 42 O. S. 302. They may be
sued jointly or separately, Id. \ 6102. If a partner a.H.slgiei, the
solvent partner must be sued alone. Bates PI. 649; if the firm
assigns for the benefit of creditors, the action must be brought
against the assignee to compel an allowance of the claim. Id.,
and partnership creditors are not necessary defendants in such
action, 29 O. S. 411. When members of a partnership form a new
firm, debts must be recovered in an action against the old firm,
17 Pa. St. 67, unless the new firm agreed to assume the debts of
the old, Bates PI. 649.
§ 5012. When action shall not abate. Marriage, disabil
ity of party, or transfer of interest. Upon the marriage
of a female who is a party, the action shall not abate, but
if it is necessary that the husband be joined therein, he
may be made a party with his wife; upon the disability
of a party, the court may allow the action to continue by
or against his representative, or successor in interest; and
upon any other transfer of interest, the action may be
continued, in the name of the original party^ or the court
may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be
substituted for him. [51 v. 57, \ 39 ; S. & Q, 958.]
§ 5013. When proper parties are not all before the
court. The court may determine any controversy be
tween parties before it, when it can be done without pre
judice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights;
but when a determination of the controversy can not be
had without the presence of other parties, the court may
order them to be brought in, or dismiss the action with
out prejudice. [51 v. 57, §40 ; S. & C. 958 ]
The last clause of this section was mandatory in the code of
1853, 14 O. S. 302, 306. The power given to the court to bring in
additional parties does not apply where the plaintifff's right to
maintain tne action depends on the presence of such additional
parties, but only when he can sustain the action against the
original party ; but a new party is necessary to its complete
settlement. Bates PI. p. 62, citing 12 Hun 236 : Pomeroy Rem.
420; see 21 Bull 313; 1 Hilt. 103; 44 O. S. 334; 2 C. C. R. 110.
§ 5014. Person claiming an interest in property made
party. In an action for the recovery of real or personal property, a person claiming an interest in the property
may, on his application, be made a party. [51 v. 57,
§ 41 ; S. & C. 958.]
§ 5013. When officer holding execution may be joined
in the action. An officer holding an execution may
be joined in an action to restrain the collection of the
same in the county in which he resides, with the per
son for whose benefit the writ issued, when such person
is a non-resident of the state, or has left the same to
avoid the service of a summons or order of injunction,
or so conceals himself that process can not be served
upon him ; and service may be made against such person
by publication, as in other cases. [56 v. 93, § 1 ; S. & C.
1172.]
14 O.445; 10 O.268,272.
§ 5016. Interpleader. Upon affidavit of a defendant
before answer, in an action upon contract, or for the
recovery of personal property, that a third party, with
out collusion with him, has or makes a claim to the
subject of the action, and that he is ready to pay or dis
pose of the same as the court may direct, the court may
make an order for the safe-keeping, or for the payment
or deposit in court of the subject of the action, or the
delivery thereof to such person as it may direct, and also
an order requiring such third party to appear in a
reasonable time, and maintain or relinquish his claim
against the defendant; and if such third party, having
been served with a copy of the order, by the sheriff, or
such other person as the court may direct, fail to appear,
the court may declare him barred of all claim in respect
to the subject of the action, against the defendant
therein ; but if he appear, he shall be allowed to make
himself defendant in the action, in lieu of the original
defendant, who shall be discharged from all liability to
either of the other parties in respect to the subject of the
action, upon his compliance with the order of the court
for the payment, deposit, or delivery thereof. [51 v. 57,
§42; S.&C.958.]
The code interpleader is a cumulative remedy, and dces not
impair the chancery interpleader, and applies when the whole
controversy turns upon the right of property or a contract or
fund in dispute, 3 W. L. M. 20. The question of ownership is to
be tried by the court, and may be appealed, Id. A stakeholder,
W. 476, an owner of a building us between contractors, 1 Bull
150; 13 Bull 361, may interplead. Two parties claiming to be a
religious society may be required to interplead, 25 O. S. 121) ; and
an interpleader may be had where the collection of a judgment
assigned to different parties is enjoined, 1 C. C. R. 563. The case
is not changed to a "special proceeding" bv bringing in and
making a new party in lieu of the original defendant, 24 O. S.
336; see, generally, 13 Kns. 30, 112; 6 Kas. S65; 90 N.Y. 234; 60
How. 67: 1 Cowen 6M ; 7 Bush. 164. No appeal, 24 O. S. 338.
§ 5017. Interpleader on application of officer. An of
ficer against whom an notion is brought to recover per
sonal property taken by him on execution, or for the
proceeds of such property sold by him, may, upon ex
hibiting to the court the process under which he acted,
with his affidavit that the property was taken or sold by
him under such process, have the benefit of the provis
ions of the preceding section, against the party in whose
favor the execution issued. [51 v. 57, \ 43; S. & C. 958.]
§ 5018. Substitution of plaintifff in execution for offi
cer. In an action against an officer for the recovery of
property taken under an execution or attachment, the
court may, upon application of the defendant, or of the
party in whose favor the execution or attachment issued,
permit the latter to be substituted as the defendant in
such action, security for costs having been given, or the
court may order such substitution to be made, on ap
plication of the officer. [80 v. 138 ; 51 v. 57, §44; S. & C.
959.]
17 O. S. 158; 6 Kas. 365; 13 Kas. 112. This section vests the
court with discretion to grant or refuse the application, 12 O. S.
189. The substitution must be made before final judgment, 8
Neb. 466. When the owner is substituted as defendant In place
of his agent, against whom replevin was brought, the sureties on
the replevi.1 bond are not released, 23 O. S. 622.
CHAPTER IV.
JOINDER OF ACTIONS.
§ 5019. What causes of action may be joined. The
plaintifff may unite several causes of action in the same
petition, whether they are such as have heretofore bean
denominated legal or equitable, or both, when they are
included in either of the following classes :

§ 5021. Actions to enforoe liens. In an action to fore
close a mortgage given to secure the payment of money,
or to enforce a specific lien for money, the plaintifff
may also ask in his petition a judgment for the money
claimed to be due ; and such proceedings shall be had,
and judgment rendered thereon, as in a civil action for
the recovery of money only. [61 v. 9, \ 1 ; S. & C. 575.]
See § 5316. This section applies only where the party against
whom the lien is sought to be enforced is also personally liable
for the debt secured by the lien, 31 O. S. 568 ; 21 O. S. 277 ; but it
is permissive and does not require the two remedies to be
demanded in the same action, 40 O. S. 520. Iu order that a
personal judgment may be taken against the mortgagor, the
petition must contain a prayer for such judgment, 31 O. S. 80;
but the court may order an execution to issue for any balance
after exhausting the proceeds of the mortgaged property, Id.
And that no personal judgment is demanded is no bar to an
action upon the note against the maker for such judgment, 40
O. S. 517. The section does not confer authority to render a per
sonal judgment upon constructive service only, 21 O. S. 142, 149.
Prior to the passage of this act (1864), it was held that an action to
foreclose a mortgage could not be joined with an action on the
note secured by it, 6 Rec. 440; and the supreme court expressed
a doubt as to the joinder of the two causes of action, 10 O. S. 438,
but held that since no objection on that ground was raised in
the court below it was waived on error, Id. Since its passage,
such causes of action have been held joinable, 19 O. S. 587 ; 29
O. S. 611, 616 ; 31 O. S. 499 ; and though the mortgage is executed
only by part of the makers of the note, judgment may be had
against all of them in a single action, 19 O. S. 587. Following
the principle of these cases, the court held that a cause of action
against a tenant under 80 v. 164 (Scott Law) for the tax and pen
alty was properly joined with one to enforce the lien against
him and the owner of the premises, 42 O. S. 237.
§ 5022. When action to be brought in oounty where
property is. Actions for the following causes must be
brought in the county in which the subject of the
action is situate, except as provided in the next two
sections :
1. For the recovery of real property, or of an estate
or interest therein.
2. For the partition of real property.
3. For the sale of real property under a mortgage,
lien, or other encumbrance or charge. [51 v. 57, § 45;
S. & C. 959.]
9Kas. 397; McCahon'sR. 118. Action to subject debtor's inter
est in land to payment of judgment, 13 O. S. 514 ; by adminis
trator to charge incumbered lands with payment of debts, 20
O. S. 539, 549.
§ 5023. When property is situated in more than one
county. When the property is situate in more than one
county, the action may be brought in either; but in
actions to recover real property, this can only be done
when the property is an entire tract. [51 v. 57, § 46 ;
S. & C. 959.]
§ 5024. Aotion for specifio performance, An action
to compel the specific performance of a contract of sale
of real estate may be brought in the county where the
defendants, or any of them, reside. [51 v. 57, § 46 ;
S. & C. 959.]
13 O. S. 571. Specific performance may be decreed of agree
ments to convey lands lying without the state where all of the
parties are within the jurisdiction of the court and served with
process, 14 O. S. 302; 24 O. S. 474. Such actions are " addressed
to the sound legal discretion of the chancellor,'' 14 O. S. 307 ; 43
O. S. 178.
§ 5025. Where the cause of action arose. Actions
for the following causes must be brought in the county
where the cause, or some part thereof, arose :
1. For the recovery of a fine, forfeiture, or penalty
imposed by a statute, except that, when it is imposed for
an offense committed on a river, or other water-course,
or a road, which is the boundary of the state, or of two
or more counties, the action may be brought in any
county bordering on such river, water-course, or road, and opposite to the place where the ofl'ense was com
mitted.
2. Against a public officer, for an act done by him in
virtue or under color of his office, or for a neglect of his
official duty.
3. On the official bond or undertaking of a public
officer. [51 v. 57, §47 ; S. & C. 959.]

slightly different, 43 N. V. 224.
§ 5026. Against domestic corporations. An action
other than one of those mentioned in the first four sec
tions of this chapter, against a corporation created under
the laws of this state, may be brought in the county
in which such corporation is situate, or has, or had
its principal office or place of business, or in which
any corporation has an office or agent; but if such
corporation is an insurance company, the action may be
brought in the county wherein the cause of action, or
some part thereof, arose; and if such corporation be
organized for the purpose of mining, either exclusively,
or in connection with other business, the action may be
brought in any county where such corporation owns or
operates a mine or mines and the cause of action, or
some part thereof, arose. [82 v. 5 ; 74 v. 29, \ 48.]
This section is not applicable to statutory actions in which a
different rule or mode of proceeding is specially authorized, 15
O. S. 409, 411. The section includes life as well as fire insurance
companies, and an action on the policy may be brought in the
county where the death of the insured occurred, 36 O. S. 544.
§ 5027. Against railroad and stage companies. An
action against the owner or lessee of a line of mail
stages, or other coaches, for an injury to person or prop
erty upon the road or line, or upon a liability as carrier,
and an action against a railroad company (1), may be
brought in any county through or into which such road
or line passes. [63 v. 87, § 49 ; S. & S. 542.]
§ 37 O. S. 649 ; 1 C. C. R. 112, 114.
§ 5028. Turnpike companies. An action other than
one of those mentioned in the first four sections of this
chapter, against a turnpike road company, may be
brought in any county in which any part of the road lies.
[51 v. 57, §50; S.&C.960.]
§ 5029, When charter presoribea place. When the
charter of a corporation created under the laws of this
state prescribes the place where suit must be brought,
that provision shall govern. [51 v. 57, § 51 ; S. & C. 960.]
§ 6030. Non-residents. Foreign corporations. An ac
tion other than one of those mentioned in the first four
sections of this chapter, against a non-resident ( 1 ) of this
state, or a foreign corporation (2), may be brought in
any county in which there is property of, or debts owing
to, the defendant, or where such defendant is found;
but if the defendant is a foreign insurance company (3),
the action may be brought in a county where the cause,
or some part thereof, arose. [51 v. 57, §52; S. & C. 960.]
1. Non-resident must be personally served or appear, to give
the court jurisdiction, unless the action is one in which serv
ice by publication can be made, 28 O. S. 451. 2. In attachment
cases, under £ 28 of Justices' Code 1853, words "foreign corpo
ration" mean foreign to the state, not foreign to the county.
12 O. S. 139. 3. "This clause was intended to give an additional
remedy against foreign insurance companies doing business In
this state ; namely, to make them liable to actions in the county
where the causes of action arose, although they might not have
property or debts due in such county, or might not even be
found in such county," 37 O. S. 371 ; generally, 21 Bull 122
§ 5031. General rule as to other actions. Exception.
Every other action must be brought in the county in
which a defendant resides or may be summoned, except
actions against an executor, administrator, guardian, or
trustee, which may be brought in the county wherein he
was appointed or resides, in which cases summons may
issue to any county. [70 v. 138, § 53.]
The word " defendant," as used in thit section, does not mean
a nominal defendant merely, but one having a real and substan
tial interest adverse to the "plaintifff, 1 1 O. H. 374. 37.S ; see 4\ O. S.
317. An action for damages for negligence, etc., causing death,
may be brought in any county where a defendant resides or may
be summoned, 32 O. S. 595. When it happens that defendants
sued as joint contractors are not such, the one residing in a for
eign county where he was served should be dismissed from the
action, 4 O. S. 436. Service on one brought within the jurisdic
tion bv requisition held invalid, 40 O. S. 130; see generally 7
Kas. 337 ; 4 Kas. 370 ; 1 Kas. 170 ; 44 O. S. 013, 628.
§ 5032. Change of venue. When it appears to the
court that a fair and impartial trial can not be had in
the county where the suit is pending, the court may
change the place of trial to some adjoining county; ana
if the application is made in the superior court, the change shall be made to another superior court, or to
the court of common pleas of an adjoining county. [51
v. 57, 1 54; 54 v. 10, § 1 ; S. & C. 392, 961.]
An application for a change of venue is addressed to the
sound discretion of the court, 11 O. S. 128; and there must be
clear and satisfactory proof that an impartial trial can not be
had to justify its allowance, Id. An objection that the removal is
not to the nearest county must be taken before trial or else it in
waived, 9 O. S. 006. § 550,80 v. 267, provides for a change of venue
in the common pleas court when a judge is interested in the
cause. The interest which requires the removal of a cause un
der that section is a pecuniary interest of the judge in the event
or result of the trial, 37 O. S. 153; and the clerk ofthe court may
be compelled by mandamus to make the required order and cer
tificate for such change when the proper affidavit has been filed
with him, 43 O. S. 324 ; see 46 Id. 178.
§ 5033. Change of venae in case of corporation!.
When a corporation having more than fifty stockholders
is a party in an action pending in a county in which the
corporation keeps its principal office, or transacts its
principal business, if the opposite party make affidavit
that he can not, as he believes, have a fair and impar
tial trial in that county, and his application is sustained
by the several affidavits of five credible persons residing
in such county, the court shall change the venue to the
adjoining county most convenient for both parties. [50
v. 100, § 1 ; S. & C. 1140.]
§ 5034. Privilege of members of legislature. A mem
ber of the senate or house of representatives, or an officer
of either branch of the general assembly, shall be privi
leged from answering to any suit which may be insti
tuted against him in a county other than the one in
which he resides, upon a cause of action which accrued
ten days before the first day of the session of the general
assembly of which he is an officer or a member ; and all
proceedings in actions to which any such person is a
party shall be stayed during such session, and during
the time necessarily employed in going thereto and
returning therefrom. [29 v. 841, l 1 ; 69 v. 6, I 1 ; S. A
C. 84 ; S. & S. 18.]
4W. L. M. 215.
§ 5035. How oivil action commenoed. A civil action
must be commenced by filing in the office of the clerk of
the proper court a petition, and causing a summons to
be issued thereon. [51 v. 57, § 55 ; S. & C. 961.]
13 Kas. 364 ; 4 Kas. 178 ; 2 Neb. 136. The jurisdiction of a cause
attaches on filiUg the petition and issuing summons, 2 D, 336 ; 33
O. S. 523. An attachment issued without a petition gives no
priority, 35 O. S. 661. The summons forms part of the record and
indicates from its date the commencement of the suit, 5 O. 225.
§ 5036. Precipe. The plaintifff shall also file with
the clerk of the court a precipe, stating therein the
names of the parties to the action, and demanding that
a summons issue. [51 v. 57, § 56 ; S. & C. 961.]
§ 5037. Requisites of summons. The summons shall
be issued and signed by the clerk (1), and be under the
seal of the court from which it is issued ; its style shall be
" The State of Ohio,
county," and it shall be dated
the day it is issued ; it shall be directed to the sheriff of
the county, who shall be commanded therein to notify
the defendant that he has been sued, and must answer at
a time stated therein, or the petition will be taken as
true and judgment rendered accordingly ; when the
action is for the recovery of money only, there shall be
indorsed (2) on the writ the amount to be stated in the
precipe, for which, with interest, judgment will be taken
if the defendant fail to answer; and if the defendant fail
to appear, judgment shall not be rendered for a larger
amount, and the costs. [51 v. 57, § 57 ; S. & C. 961.]
1. Or deputy. T5 O. 288. Clerk is not bound to issue summons
without a precipe, 6 O. 150. 2. 25 O. S. 82; 31 O. S. 87; 8 Bull
111 ; whether the action sounds in contractor tort, 31 O. S. 87 ; but
not in an action for the sale of mortgaged premises and for a per
sonal judgment. No indorsement of any kind is necessary, 31
O. S. 499, and the absence of an indorsement in such case does
not render the proceeding erroneous, though the court on de
fault renders a decree for the sale of the mortgaged property,
but no personal judgment, 26 O. S. 644. Judgment by default
can not oc taken against the defendant who has not otherwise
appeared in an action for the recovery of money only, where
the summons served has no indorsement upon it of the amount
claimed, 25 O. S. 82. A recital in the writ ofthe amount, without
an indorsement, not sufficient, 40 O. S. 603 (action before justice).
§ 5038. When summons may issne to other oountiea.
"When the action is rightly hrought in any county accord
ing to the provisions of chapter five of this division, a
summons maybe issued to any other county, against one
or more of the defendants, at the plaintifff 's request ;
but no maker or acceptor, or, if the bill is not accepted,
no drawer, of an instrument for the payment of money
only, shall be held liable in an action thereon, except on
warrant of attorney, in any county other than [the] one
in which he, or one of the joint makers, acceptors, or
drawers, resides or is summoned. [68 v. 77, (> 58.]
An action to enforce the statutory liability of stockholders is
not rightly brought, within the meaning of this section, when
none of the defendants reside or could be summoned here,
although one of them indorsed upon the summons issued for
him to the sheriff of this county ana mailed to him by plaintiffTs
attorney at his residence in another county his acceptance of
service and entry of appearance, 10 Bull 413 (C. S. C.) A non
resident of the county served out of the county with summons
in a case brought on three causes of action, one of which is
against said non-resident jointly with the resident of the county,
and the other two are against such non-resident a lone, can on mo
tion enter his appearance as to such two causes of action solely
for the pin-poses of the motion, have the said two causes of
action stricken from the petition, and be dismissed from the
cause as to them, 11 Bull 199 (C. P.) Service of summons on
party decoyed Into county or brought into state by requisition
set aside, 6 Rec. 404 ; 7 Id. 212 ; 40 O. S. 130 ; see 19 Bull 269.
§ 5039. When summons returnable. When the time
for bringing parties into court is not fixed by statute,
the summons shall be returnable on the second Monday
after its date ; but when it is issued to any other county,
it may be made returnable, at the option of the party
having it issued, on the third or fourth Monday after its
date ; and the day of the month on which it is return
able shall be stated therein. [51 v. 57, § 59 ; S. & C. 962.]
18 Kas. 114 ; 21 Kas. 475. The statute is mandatory. No dis
cretion is vested in the clerk in respect to return or answer days,
3 Neb. 218.
§ 5040. Alias writs. When a writ is returned " not
summoned," other writs may be issued, until the defend
ant is summoned ; and when defendants reside in differ
ent counties, writs may be issued to such counties at the
same time. [51 v. 57, § 60 ; S. & U. 962.]
The service of an alias summons within the life of a prior
nmmons is not void or voidable when at the time, it was issued
and served the prior summons was not in the hands of the officer
nor under his control, 28 O. S. 451.
§ 5041. Who may serve summons. The summons
shall be served by the officer to whom it is directed, who
shall indorse on the original writ the time and manner
of service (1), or it may be served by any person not a
party to the action, appointed
authority of such person shall be indorsed on the writ (2);
and when the writ is served by a person appointed by
the officer to whom it is directed, or when the service is
made out of the state, the return shall be verified by
oath (3). [51 v. 57, § CI ; S. & C. 962.]
1. 3 W. L. M. 214. The return of the officer is conclusive be
tween parties and privies as to all things the law authorizes or
requires him to do officially, 14 O. S. 240. Affidavit of deputy
sheriff that he believed he served summons in error insufficient,
40 O. S. 231. 2. Without such indorsement of authority, there
is no such service as will charge third persons with notice of the
pendency of au action, as provided in § 5055, 36 O. S. 344. Pre
sumption after judgment where service is made by unauthor
ized person, 9 Neb. 94. 8. 31 O. S. 646.
§5042. Manner of servica and return. The service
shall be by delivering, at any time before the return
day (1 ), a copy of the summons, with the indorsements
thereon (2), to the defendant personally (3), or by leav
ing a copy at his usual place of residence (4), or, if the
defendant is a partnership sued by its company name,
by leaving a copy at its usual place of doing business (5),
and the return must be made at the time mentioned in
the writ, and the time and manner of service shall be
stated on the writ. [51 v. 57, \\ 62, 63, 64 ; 76 v. 15, § 1 ;
S. & C. 962, 963.]
See 11 5011, 5381. 1. Service of summons on the return day is
not void, but voidable, 17 O. S. 225; 1 Neb. 432; and the objec
tion that summons was served on the return day and not re
turned until two davs thereafter is waived bv filing an answer,
7 O. S. 309. 2. 2 W. L. M. 588 ; see 3 Id. 214. 3. Return showing
service by " reading " insufficient, 41 O. S. 285 (under justice's
act, S. & C. 773) ; 9 Neb. 504. 4. Leaving copy at defendant's
"place of business " isnotgood serviceon an individual defend
ant, 25 O. S. 330; 9 Neb. 504. A return showing that the sheriff
left a copy of the summons at the residence of the defendant is
sufficient. 15 O. 288; and a return " served the same by leaving
at each of the within named defendants' . . . usual place of
residence a certified copy," etc., is good service upon both hus
band and wife, 43 O. S. 198; but a return of a summons issued
against three defendants "served bv leaving a copy of this writ
at the residence of the within named defendant," the sheriff
having taxed on the writ the fees for serving one person, was
held not good service as to all or any, 16 O. 371. 6. 18 O. S. 134:
39 O. S. 249; (S. & C. 1138) ; on garnishee, U 5530, 5534.
§5043. What equivalent to servioe. An acknowl
edgment on the back of the summons, or petition, by
the party sued, or the voluntary appearance of a defend
ant, is equivalent to service. [51 v. 57, § 65 ; S. & C. U63.]
A motion denying jurisdiction for insufficient process is not
an appearance, 3 W. L. M. 195; nor a motion to set aside sum
mons, 2 O. S. C. R. 30 ; nor a motion to discharge an attachment,
3 Bull 458 ; nor to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of prrson, 39
O. S. 249 ; nor is an answer denying jurisdiction of the person,
11 O. S. 374 ; but a motion to vacate a judgment, 25 O. S. 340; 11
O. S. 503, unless based onaualleged wautof jurisdiction, 11 O.S.
503, Is an appearance ; and a motion to strike papers from the

her appearance. 15 O. S. 485. It is not proper practice for the at
torney of plaintifff to acknowledge service of process for the de
fendant, 1 H. 530.
§5044. Servioe on corporation. A summons against
a corporation may be served upon the president, mayor,
chairman or president of the board of directors or trust
ees, or other chief officer ; or, if its chief officer be not
found in the county, upon its cashier, treasurer, secre
tary, clerk, or managing agent ; or, if none of the afore
said officers can be found, by a copy left at the office or
usual place of business of such corporation, with the
person having charge thereof (1); and if such corpora
tion is a railroad company, whether foreign, or created
under the laws of this state, and whether the charter
thereof prescribes the manner and place, or either, of
service of process thereon, the summons may be served
upon any regular ticket (2) or freight agent thereof; or,
it there is no such agent, then upon any conductor, in
any county in this state in which such railroad is located,
or through which it passes (3) ; but if the defendant is
an incorporated river transportation company, whether
organized under the laws of this or another state, the
service of a summons may be upon the master, or other
chief officer, of any of its steamboats or other craft, or
upon any of its authorized ticket or freight agents, at
any post [port] where it transacts business. [65 v. 116,
|66; 76 v. 145, §10; S.&S. 542.]
See \\ 6477, 6478, 1. When service is made on a subordinate
officer, or " by copy left at the office," etc., the return must show
that the chief officer could not be found in the first case, and in
the second that none of the specified officers, chief or subordi
nate, could be found in the county, 13 O. S. 563. In case of a
dissolved corporation, service on the members of the last acting
board of directors is sufficient, 20 O. S. 190. 2. 1 C. C. R. 112,
115; but service on a ticket agent, appointed by the receiver of
the company, is not good. 1 C. C. R. 511 ; nor is service upon a trav
eling solicitor of the company, 16 Bull 6. 3. It is not necessary,
to give the court jurisdiction, that the line passing through the
county should be absolutely owned by the defendant railroad
company ; a title by lease and user of it as a railroad is suffi
cient, 1 C. C. R. 115. When officer, etc., is non-resident, ? 5052a.
§ 5045. On insurance company. When the defendant
is an insurance company, and the action is brought in
a county in which there is an agency thereof, the service
mav be upon the chief officer of such agency. [51 v. 57,
§67"; S. &C. 963.]
§5046. On foreign corporation. When the defendant
is a foreign corporation, having a managing agent in
this state, the service may be upon such agent. [51 v.
57, §68; S. &C. 963.]
17 O. S. 641 ; 1 C. S. C. R. 311 ; 2 Id. 75 ; 1 H. 571 ; 9 Bull 193.
§ 5047. How infants served. When the defendant is
under the age of fourteen years, the service must be
upon him, and also upon his guardian, or his father ;
or, if neither his guardian nor his father can be found,
then upon his mother, or the person having the care of
such infant, or with whom he lives ; if neither of these
can be found, or if the defendant is a minor over four
teen years of age, service upon the defendant alone shall
be sufficient ; and the manner of service may be the same
as in the case of adults. [51 v. 57, §69; S. & C. 963.]
It is irregular to proceed against an infant, until the process
has been served strictly in accordance with this section, 1 H. 287.
The summons should properly show, as a guide to the sheriff,
the age of each infant as stated in the petition, Id.; 2 Law Gaz.
4W. The return of the sheriff, that he has served process on the
infant alone, is insufficient, unless accompanied with a state
ment that there could be found no guardian or father, no
mother, or person having the care of the infant or with whom
he lived, or that the minor is over fourteen years of age, 1 H. 287.
SUBDIVISION II. CONSTRUCTIVE SERVICE.
§ 6048. When service by publication may be made.
Service may be had by publication in either of the fol
lowing cases:
1. In actions under the first three sections of the last
chapter, when the defendant resides out of the state, or
his residence can not be ascertained.
2. In actions to establish or set aside a will, when a
defendant resides out of the state, or his residence can
not be ascertained.
3. In actions in which it issought by a provisional rem
edy to take, or appropriate in any way, the property of
the defendant, when the defendant is a foreign corpora
tion, or a non-resident of this state, or the defendant's
place of residence is unknown, and in actions against a
corporation incorporated under the laws of this state,
which has failed to elect officers, or to appoint an agent,
upon whom service of summons can be made, as pro
vided by section five thousand and forty-four, and which
has no place of doing business in this state.
4. In actions which relate to, or the subject of which
is, real or personal property in this state, when a defend
ant has or claims a lien thereon, or an actual or contin
gent interest therein, or the relief demanded consists
wholly or partly in excluding him from any interest
therein, and such defendant is a non-resident of the
state, or a foreign corporation, or his place of residence
can not be ascertained.
5. In actions against executors, administrators, or
guardians, when the defendant has given bond as such
in this state, but at the time of the commencement of the
action is a non-resident of the state, or his place of res
idence can not be ascertained.
6. In actions where the defendant, being a resident of
this state, has departed from the county of his residence,
with intent to delay or defraud his creditors, or to avoid
the service of summons, or keeps himself concealed
with like intent.
7. When a defendant in a petition in error has no
attorney of record in this state, and is a non-resident of
and absent from the same, or has left the same to avoid
the service of summons in error, or so conceals himself
that such process can not be served upon him.
8. In an action or proceeding under chapter six, divis
ion four, of this title, or to impeach a judgment or order
for fraud, or to obtain an order of satisfaction thereof,
when a defendant is a non-resident of the state.
In any such case, when the residence of a defendant
is known, it must be stated in the publication ; immedi
ately after the first publication, the party making the
service shall deliver to the clerk copies of the publica
tion, with the proper postage, and the clerk shall mail a
copy to each defendant, directed to his residence named
therein, and make an entry thereof on the appearance
docket ; and in all other cases, the party who makes the
§ 5052a. Servioe of •amnions on corporation, how
made when officer, agent or director is a non-resident.
Whenever it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction
of any court of record in this state, in any action now
pending, or hereafter to be brought therein, that any one
named as a party defendant is a corporation organized
under the laws of the state of Ohio, owning or other
wise interested in i e il or personal property within the
jurisd'ction of such court, is a proper party therein, and
that there is no officer, agent, or director of such cor
poration within the state of Ohio upon whom service of
summons in said action can be made, it shall be lawful
for said court to authorize any person residing in or out
of the state to make service of summons on such corpo
ration by delivering to the last known president, or other
chief officer or director of such corporation, a copy of
the summons therein, and the parson making such serv
ice shall make affidavit thereto, and forthwith make re
turn to the clerk. That whenever service of summons
shall have been so made, the said service shall have the
same effect, and shall be taken and held as if made
upon said corporation in this state by personal service
of such summons upon the proper officer, agent, or di
rector of such corporation upon whom a service of sum
mons is now authorized by law to be made in other
cases. [86 v. 172.]
gDUDU. How publication made. The publication must
be made for six consecutive weeks, in a newspaper
printed in the county where the petition is filed ; or, if
there is no newspaper printed in the county, then in a newspaper printed in this state, and of general circula
tion in such county; if it be made in a daily newspaper,
one insertion a week shall be sufficient; and it must
contain a summary statement of the object and prayer
of the petition, mention the court wherein it is filed,
and notify the person or persons thus to be served when
they are required to answer. [51 v. 57, \ 72 ; 62 v. 66.]
16 O. 66.
Six consecutive weeks, 1 Bull 109. Mistake in notice, 2
C. C. R. 110. Approval of service by publication by the court
is not required Dy the code, 2 H. 1. 8. A finding that notice
has been given non-resident defendants by publication accord
ing to law can not be collaterally impeached, 2 O. S. 270 ; 8 O. S.
686, but is not conclusive upon bill of review, 13 O. S. 431, 439.
§5051. When service complete, and how proved.
Service by publication shall be deemed complete at the
dateof the last publication (1), when made in the manner
and for the time prescribed in the preceding sections ;
and such service shall be proved by affidavit (2). [51
v. 57, 1 73 ; S. & C. 964.]
1. 40 O. S. 636. 2. A copy of the published notice, with the
affidavit of one of the publishers that it was inserted and pub
lished in the paper as required by the order of publication, is
sufficient, 17 O. 27.
§ 5052. Personal service out of the state. When serv
ice may be made by publication, personal service of a
copy of the summons and petition may be made out of
the state. [51 v. 57, ? 74 ; S. & C. 965.]
Such service can not be made upon a non-resident in an action
to recover a judgment for money only to be enforced by execu
tion, 28 O. S. 451 ; and where the action is for the conveyance of
lands without the state, such service will not conferjurisdiction
over the person served, 14 O. S. 302. An affidavit made out of the
state verifying the return of such service of a summons must be
made before a person authorized by the code to take depositions,
31 O. S. 646, \\ 5269, 5270.
§ 6053. Service upon unknown heirs. When an heir
or a devisee of a deceased person is a necessary party,
and it appears by affidavit that his name and residence
are unknown to the plaintifff, proceedings against him
may be had without naming him; and the court, or a
judge thereof, shall make an order respecting the publi
cation of notice, but the order shall require not less
than six weeks' publication. [79 v. 26 ; 51 v. 57, \ 76;
S. & C. 965.]
10 O.275; 35 0.S. 387.
§ 5054. Procedure when defendants are not all served.
'When service has heen made on one or more defendants,
but not on all, the plaintifff may proceed as follows :
1. If the action is against defendants jointly indebted
upon contract, he may proceed against the defendants
served, unless the court otherwise direct.
2. If the action is against defendants severally liable,
he may, without prejudice to his rights against those not
served, proceed against the defendants served. [51 v. 57,
§ 77 ; S. & C. 965.]
This section authorizes a judgment against such joint con
tractors as have been 1< served " with summons in the action in
those cases only where the action was commenced by the filing
of a petition and the issuing of summons against all of the joint
contractors, 81 O. S. 572. Where a joint judgment is rendered
against several defendants, part of whom only were served with
process, such judgment is void as against those not served, and
voidable as against those served. 29 O. S. 617, citing 16 O. 271;
21 O. S. 181; but where the liability is several the judgment is
void as to those not served and valid as to those served, 31 O. S.
499. Where a joint suit against all the obligors in a bond is the
only remedy of the plaintifff, it is error to render a several judg
ment against one, leaving the action to proceed as to the others,
23 O. S. 543. A judgment rendered by a justice of the peace
upon a joint note against one of the makers, the other having
been a non-resident of, and not found within, the county, is no
bar to a subsequent action upon such note against the latter, 42
O. S. 11.
§ 5055. Lis pendens. When the summons (1) has been
served or publication (2) made, the action is pending so
as to charge third persons with notice of its pendency ;
and while pending, no interest can be acquired by third
persons in the subject matter thereof as against the
plaintifff's title (3). [51 v. 57, § 78 ; S. & C. 906.]
1. 26 O.S. 467; 31 O. S. 572; S3 O. S. 523 ; 3 O. 337 ; 6 Bull 832;
but service of summons by a person appointed by the sheriff for
that purpose without indorsing his authority thereon does not
charge third persons with notice of the pendency of the action,
30 O. S. 344. 2. 5 O. 401 ; 17 O. S. 225. 3. Action abated by death
of one of the parties no longer a lis pendens until revivor, 14 O.
109. Appearance effected by obtaining leave to answer sufficient
to charge third persons with notice, 25 O. S. 652. Doctrine does
not apply to negotiable paper, 11 O. S. 252 ; or stock, 21 Bull
313; to parties in interest not parties to the action, 17 O. 226;
14 O. 109; 18 O. S. 546; to proceedings in alimony, 7 O. (Pt. 1),
161; unless real estate is described, 30 O. S. 579; where the ob
ject of the suit is to recover specifically real estate or to affect
title, 7 O. (Pt. 1), 101, K.4. Conveyance pendente lite is good as
between the parties, but can not change the right of the liti
gants, 5 O. 461. Delay of plaintifff' does not oust jurisdiction, 41
O. S. 271. Order to debtor in procee ings in aid is Ms pendent.
6 O. S. 254. Prosecution must be close and continuous, 14 O. 100;
'28 O. S. 181. Purchaser of subject matter of suit acquires no
interest as against plaintifff's title, 3 O. 541. Supplemental bill
is a continuation of its pendens, 8 O. 2U3 ; 10 O. y. 365.
§ 5056. Ida pendens as to suits in other counties.
When any part of real property, the subject matter of
an action, is situate in any county or counties other than
the one in which the action is brought, a certified copy
of the judgment in such action must be recorded in the
recorders office of such other county or counties, before
it shall operate therein as notice so as to charge third
persons, as provided in the preceding section ; but it
shall operate as such notice, without record, in the
county where it is rendered; but this section shall not
apply to actions or proceedings under any statute which
does not require such record. [51 v. 57, \ 79 ; S. & C.
966.]
§ 5057. Forms and rules of pleading. The forms of
pleading in civil actions in courts of record, and the
rules by which their sufficiency shall be determined, are
those prescribed in this chapter. [51 v. 57, § 83 ; S. & C.
968.]
See I 4971.
§ 5058. Definition of pleadings. The pleadings are the
written statements by the parties of the facts constitu
ting their respective claims and defenses ; all fictions
therein are abolished, and the title of a cause shall not
be changed in any of its stages, except when the defend
ant prosecutes error. [51 v. 57, $ 82, 115, 116; S. & C.
968, 984.]
§ 5059. What pleadings allowed. The only pleadings
allowed are—
1. Petition.
2. Demurrer.
.3. Answer, which, when affirmative relief is demanded
therein, may be styled cross-petition.
4. Eeply. [54 v. 91, § 84 ; S. & C. 968.]
Cross-petition. A cross-petition may be contained in the answer
without any formal designation. An answer with prayer is a cross-petition, 7 O. S. 322; 6 O. S. 207. Plaintiff against whom
an answer demanding " affirmative relief " is filed is a defend
ant to a cross-petition, and has until third Saturday after filing
to answer it, 40 O. S. 344. It is not necessary to entitle the de
fendant to set up in his answer a claim to relief by way of crosspetition that the answer should contain a denial of the alle
gations of the petition, but it may consist of the statement of
purely affirmative matter, 20 O. S. 208. When, upon motion of
the defendant, additional parties are brought in as defendants,
it is error to grant reliel against them on default in favor
of the defendant making the motion in the absence of a
cross-petition asking relief, 12 O. S. 402. Defendant in error
may nle a cross-petition asking a reversal of the judgment for
errors prejudicial to him, 22 O. S. 516; without leave 85 O. S. 80.
"When original action and not cross-petition proper remedy, 26
O. S. 652. Demurrer to reply to cross-petition puts in issue the
question n hether the matter set up in the answer is proper sub
ject of cross-petition, Id. Reply to cross-petition may plead
set-off. 1 C. S. C. R. 259. Appeal may be had on equitable coun
ter-claim before issue at law disposed of; see 17 O. S. 690 ; 26 Id.
426, 514; 83 Id. 10; 80 Id. 50. When the issues presented by a
cross-petition are complicated and important, the case is a
proper one to be docketed as a separate action, 2 D. 286, 296. A
motion to a cross-petition separately docketed as a distinct case
can only be granted where there is a misjoinder of actious and
a demurrer therefore hug been granted, 2 Hull (Sup.) 5. When
sUmmons necessary, lu W. L. J. \u2; U C. R. 144.
SUBDIVISION II. PETITION.
§ 5060. Petition. Contents. The first pleading on
the part of the plaintifff shall be the petition, which
must contain :
1. The name of the court and the county in which the
action is brought, and the names of the parties, followed
by the word " Petition."
2. A statement of the facts constituting the cause of
action, in ordinary and concise language.
3. A demand of the relief to which the party supposes
himself entitled; if the recovery of money is demanded,
the amount shall be stated ; and if interest is claimed,
the time for which interest is to be computed shall be
also stated. [51 v. 57, i} 85 ; S. & C. 969.]
The name of the court and the county in which the action is
brought, must be stated, 15 How. Pr. 336 ; 14 Kas. 101. An omis
sion or defect in this particular should be taken advantage of by
motion, 27 Ark. 148; 15 How. Pr. 336; as well as an omission of
the word "petition " in the caption, 1 H. 40. The full names of
the plaintifffs and defendants should be given in the title, Bliss
Code PI. § 145; and if given in the title, they need not be repeated
in the petition, and may be afterwards referred to as plaintifffs
and defendants, 13 Neb. 409 ; Bliss Code PI. § 145. The full names
of partners must be stated in actions by and against a partnership, Bliss Code PI. J 145 ; and where they are given in the title.
it is not necessary to repeat them in the petition, 13 Neb. 409. It
is not absolutely necessary that the title describe the parties as
partners, and give the partnership name, if the facts appear in
the body of the petition, though it is the better practice to desig
nate them in the title, Bliss Code PI. g 145. Where parlies sue in
a representative capacity, the fact sin mid be stated in the title,
or in the body of the petition, 8 N. Y. 472; 11 How. Pr. 11. The
representative capacity is designated by the use of the word
-as" or its equivalent. 2 Abb. N. C. 238; 62 N. Y. 639. The omis
sion of the word "as" is not. however, conclusive when the
representative capacity is disclosed in the body of the petition.
94 N. Y. 302 ; 73 N. Y. 292. On the other hand, it is held that
they must describe themselves in the title and body of the peti
tion as representatives, and must distinctly aver that they are
such, or sue in their representative capacity, 10 Kas. 206; 1 W.
L. M. 155.
Facts are to be stated positively, 1 D. 159, and not on informa
tion or belief, 1 O. S. 504 ; T3 O. S. 228. An objection to this
mode of statement can not be raised by demurrer, 13 O. S. 228;
hut the defendant may deny in his answer that he has knowl
edge or information of the facts stated in the petition, 11 O. S.
183 ; 2 D. 223.
Consistency is required as a rule of pleading. PIeadings, con
taining inconsistent statements, are construed most strongly
against the pleader, 29 O. S. 655; 15 Kas. 41. Only such causes
of action can be united as are consistent with each other, 2 D.
584 ; 97 N. Y. 245. A demand for relief and for a judgment for a
specified sum are inconsistent, 10 How. Pr. 445 ; a claim for con
version and for delivery of the same property, 7 How. Pr. 246 ;
lor rent and for use and occupation, 9 Minn. 100. PIaintiff can
not seek to affirm a contract and to set it aside, IS O. S. 129 : nor
seek a forfeiture of a lease for non-payment of rent and judg
ment for rent, 2 D. 574, 585. An election must be made between
inconsistent claims, 1 H. 217. The objection is reached by mo
tion, 30 O. S. 600 ; unless the inconsistency amounts to a misjoin
der when demurrer lies, 2 D. 574, 584: but the rule does not re
quire a party seeking to recover upon two grounds, both of
which can not be true, but he does not know which one, to stand
upon one or the other. He may state them as separate causes of
action, and in the alternative, in one petition, 9 Bull 355; 16
Bull, 399. So where a party has one or two defenses, and can
not, with certainty, state either one, he has been allowed to
state them separately; as where a party, being charged upon a
promissory note, answered, first, that he did not sign the note,
and, second, that if he did sign it, the signature was obtained by
fraud, 29 O. S. 78; or that there was no consideration therefore,
and he can not be compelled to elect on which of the two de
fenses he will proceed to trial, 30 O. S. 600. In an action against
a railroad for Killing a horse, counting on neglect to keep fences
in repair, and negligently running its train, the court overruled
a motion to compel plaintifff to elect, saying that the addition of
a tort to a separate and distinct act, in violation of a contract,
did not deprive the injured party of the right to complain at the
same time of both wrongs, 41 O. S. 233. In an action against a
corporation, by the holder of a certificate of stock, issued by the
secretary of the corporation, for the repudiation of such certlflcate, the petition averred, first, that the certificate was genuine
and valid, and second, that if the certificate was an overissue
it was such by the fraud and neglect of the corporation, and it
was held that plaintifff might attempt to sustain either or both
of said causes of action, 11 Bull 86; see 10 Bull 142.
Conclusions of law must not be pleaded, as that an assessment
is illegal, 44 O. S. 51 ; that an act is contrary to etatute, 13 Barb.
209 ; that a contract is void for want of consideration, 58 How. Pr.
426; that plaintifff was compelled to pay a sum of money, 41
Barb. 841 ; 41 N. Y. 619; thut a party is not entitled to a thing,
10 How. 377. Allegations of duty, 31 O. S. 555, of indebtedness, 5
Bosw. 645, of fraud. Bliss Code PL \ 211, are conclusions of law,
but not allegations of negligence, Id ; 80 Ky. 84. An allegation
that a contract is not binding, or a party not liable, is a conclu
sion of law, 34 O. S. 450, 467 ; that defendant was bound by law
to fence, 31 O. S. 555 ; that a note is " not outstanding," 29' O. S.
13, or that it is " not in existence," 32 O. S. 449. " Nothing due
thereon " is aconcluson of law, 29 O. S. 13, and that an "injury
will be irreparable," 31 O. S. 420. Conclusions of law are not
admitted by demurrer, 37 O. S. 402 ; 33 O. S. 32 ; nor by failure to
deny,
31 O. S. 555.must be averred in an action on a contract, 37
Consideration
Barb. 152. This is the general rule, with the exceptions that it
need not be alleged in actions on instruments under seal, 13
O. 68 ; W. 221 ; upon a promissory note or bill ol exchange,
1 O. 115; where the instrument upon which the action is
brought purports to be " for value received," 16 O. 1, and In
pleading
under
§ 5086. it would seem, must be pleaded, 40 O. S.
Corporate
existence,
517. In 22 O. S. 159. it was said, " our courts will not take notice
of the existence of a foreign corporation; " but in 26 O. S. 562,
" that the code does not require the title of the plaintifff to sue
to be more specifically set out than Wits required at common
law. '' In 40 O. ^. 517, it was said. " the averment, while it was
necessary' was waived by going to trial without objection, and
was supplied by the allegation in the answer that the defend
ant below contracted with the plaintifff in its corporate name."
The requirements of the N. Y. Code, Civ. Pro. § 1775, are that the
petition must aver that the plaintifff is a corporation, whether
it is a domestic or foreign corporation, and, if the latter, the
state, country, or government by or under whose laws it was
created. The courts, it is held, will take notice of the existence
of a municipal corporation, 68 Ala. 145, Bliss Code PI. § 259 (but
not whether it is of a certain class. '5 O. S. 319), and of a private
corporation created by public act. Bliss Code Pi. 259.
Damages. Plaintiff can only recover the amount of damages
claimed in his petition, 3 Wend. 35ti ; 17 John 111 , and, if greater
damages are given than claimed, he must remit the excess
before he can have judgment, 11 Hun 295. General damages,
such as necessarily result from the injury, need not be specially
pleaded, 67 N . Y. 267 ; 82 N. Y. 308 ; but where damages are the
natural consequences of the act, though not necessarily the
result of it, they must be specially alleged in the petition. Boone
Code PI. §l8: 12 N. Y. 277: Bliss Code PI. § 297h; and where
they are the foundation of the plaintifff's claim they must be
fully stated, 60 How. Pr. 316, as in actions for slander for words
not actionable per sc, 65 Barb. 62; in actions for assault and battery, 23 Han 54. In malicious prosecution the amount of costs
and counsel fees are elements of special damages, and must be
specially pleaded, 7 Daly 74 ; in actions fur injuries to land, lost
of rents must be specially pleaded to be recovered, 14 Wend.
159: in actions for damages to baggage by common carrier, loss
of employment occasioned by the injury, 2 I). 237, 247; in an
action for possession of land, mense profits must be specially
pleaded, 12 Barb. 4S1, and for detention of premises after the
expiration of the term, S3 Ind. 387. In trespass de Imnm a*je,rtntu
the plaintifff's expenses in recovering possession should l,e spe
cially averred, 22 Minn. u78 ; in tin action for fraud in selling sheep
with a contagious disease, special damitges resulting to plaint
iff's sheep, and to his pasture into which the contagious sheep
were turned, should lie averred, 21 O. S. CM; in an action for
damages against a railroad for injury, the petition not alien<ng
that expenses for physicians' services were incurred, evidence of
the value of such services is not admissible. 1 r. (.'. R. 37.
Demand, when necessary betore bringing suit, must be al
leged, 5 O. ij. 87, as in an action on a note to charge an indorser,
1 H. 29; 11 Abb. Pr. '215, for detention of personal propertv.
57 N. Y. 2S; 55 N. Y. C71 ; in an action on an executor's bond
by a creditor or distributee under gg 6210, 6211 R.S.2O S. 574;
5 O. S. 87, when required by the terms of the contract, 27 O. S.
484, and to be made in a particular form, 21 Wend. 256; to fix
the liability of sureties, 9 O. 106; 5 O. +41 ; 16 O. S. 552 ; of a
guarantor, 6 How. Pr. 214 ; in an action against an attorney for
money collected by him, 4 Ala. 493; IS 1nd. 342 ; 5 Kas. 59; but in
an action on a note payable on demand, 24 N. Y, 307; 17 O. 9; 9
O. S. 517 ; upon a contract to pay money absolutely ; 16 N. Y. 451 ;
and against the maker of a note to pay money at a ptrticular
place, 48 N. Y. 520, demand is not necessary and need not be
pleaded.
Evidence.. It is a rule of pleading that evidence must not bo
stated, 1 W. L. M. 90; Bliss Code PI. §206.
Fraud must be specially averred, 44 Barb. 166 ; 55 Barb. 202.
A general charge of fraud is not sufficient, 6 Neb. 192; 1 O. S.
478, 505 ; 18 Kas. 169 ; nor is a minute statement of the facts and
circumstances constituting the general charge required, 73 N. Y.
571. When the facts constituting the fraud are not clearly
known to plaintifff, it is held that they may be stated in the
alternative, 2 \V. C. Rep. 205.
Knowledge, -when constituting the gist of the action, must be
specially pleaded, 13 Johns. 339; as in cases of injuries commit
ted by domestic animals, 30 Barb. 147, the owner is not liable
unless it is alleged that he had notice or knowledge of their
vicious propensities, Id.; and where an animal commits an
injury while trespassing upon the land of another, 1 N. Y. 515.
So in an action of deceit in the sale of goods, scienter is necessary
to sustain the action, 53 Barb. 425 ; and in an action for injuries
by a servant in the use ol defective machinery, knowledge of or
notice to the master of its defective condition should be averred,
56 Barh.
notice.151.Where the facts lie more properly within the knowl
edge of one of the parties than the other, notice is requisite, 4 O.
105, and, when necessary, must be specially pleaded, 23 N. H.
471 ; and if plaintifff relies on facts which excuse notice, he must
state them, 4 Sand. 665.
Ovmerstiip or titte must be alleged, 64 How. Pr. 117 ; Bliss Code
PI. § 221. In actions affecting realty it is sufficient in this state to
allege that plaintifff has the legal estate, § 5781. In actions for
the recovery of possession of personal property, plaintifff must
allege ownership, general or special. A statement that plaintifff
is entitled to possession is not sufficient, 29 Hun 256. A general
allegation of ownership is sufficient, as in an action for the con
version of personal property it is sufficient for plaintifff to state
that he is the owner, 88 N. Y. 156 ; in an action by an assignee in
bankruptcy to recover the assets, an allegation that he owns the
property is a sufficient statement of title, 48 Cal. 489. In an
action on a note, it is sufficient to allege that the plaintifff is the
lawful ovbonafide holder and owner thereof, 15 N. Y.425; 15 How.
Pr. 1 ; 32 Wis. 243 ; in an action on a note or bill by any one not
an original party, he must show the facts which give him title,
32 Mo. 188; 35 Mo. 312; but see § 50S6; 32 O. S. 449.
Place. Where the matters pleaded are local in their nature,
allegations of place are material and of the substance of the
issue, Bliss Code PL § 284, as in actions affecting realty, Id. § 285.
Actions may be made local by statute, when allegations of
place must be specially pleaded, § 5025 R. S.
Representatice capacity. The representative capacity in which
a party sueg should be pleaded; an averment in the caption
alone is not sufficient, 20 S. C. 460 ; 28 How. Pr. 326; 23 Barb.
592. The body of the pleading must show that the party sues in
his representative capacity. 94 N. Y. 302, as where plaintifffs sue
as executors or administrators, 73 N. Y. 292, or partners, 20 S. C.
460; "but if the representative capacity appears in the body of the
petition it has been held sufficient though it does not appear in
the title, 8 Daly 172. Where one sues as executor or administra
tor he must aver his appointment and title as such in partic
ular, 61 How. Pr. 494; but an allegation of appointment, with
out a statement of particulars and qualification, has been held
sufficient on demurrer, 27 O. S. 366. The approved way is to
allege the death of decedent ; that letters of administration upon
the estate (or testamentary, as the Ciise may be) were issued to
the plaintiff upon a day (named) by the court (named), and that
he is still acting as such administrator, or executor, Bliss Code
PL \ 264; but in an action on an instrument given by an execu
tor or administrator as such, it is not necessary to allege the
time and manner of his appointment, 58 How. Pr. 1; 61 How.
Pr. 494 ; 18 Hun 375. In case of dissolution of a partnership, by
the death of a partner or otherwise, the action must be brought
by the survivors, and the pleader will not describe the obliga
tion as given to plaintifffs, but to A, B and C. who composed the
firm at the time; and it must be alleged that one of them, as C,
has since died, and that they are the surviving members of the
firm, Bliss Code PL § 265,
Time, when material, should be pleaded, 12 N. Y. 133; but
unless it is descriptive of a written instrument of record, W. 430,
or is a condition precedent to a right of action, 18 O. 532, alle
gations concerning it need not generally be pleaded.
Value ana quantity. When not descriptive of the subject of the
action, allegations of value and quantity need not be proved as
alleged, 2 Abb. Pr. 330; 39 la. 106.
Prayer for relief. The plaintifff may demand any relief to
which he supposes himself entitled, 30 O. S. 374, and may have any relief to which the facts show he is entitled, 29 O. S. 566.
He may unite legal and equitable grounds of relief in the same
demand, 21 O. S. 119, when not inconsistent with each other, 16
O. S. 118 ; and where they are not consistent, he must elect upon
which one he will stand, 95 N. Y. 237; and the prayer may. in
such case, determine the character of the action, 21 O. S. 277.
PIaintiff may pruy for alternative relief. 24 O. S. 572 ; 2 C. S. C. R.
16'; 30 O. S. 374; without rendering his pleading open to the
objection of inconsistency, 65 How. Pr. 298 ; 29 Kas. 765. He
may pray for reformation of a contract and damages in the same
action, 21 O. S. 119, or for an injunction anddamages, 31 O.S.209:
and though he pray for the wrontf kind of relief, 90 N. V. 372, or
too much or too little, his action will not for that cause be
defeated, Id. "The rule is now well settled that in actions
brought for equitable relief and tried before a judge, though
there appears to be no ground for granting such relief, the court
should retain the cause and grant such legal relief as may be
just," 55 Barb. 482; 56 N. Y. 12; 42 Oal. 279. The prayer does
not constitute part of the issues to be tried, 33 O. .S. 546 ; 29 Kas.
771 ; does not of itself and alone determine the character of the
action, 25 O. S. 422 ; its form may be disregarded, 21 O. S. 466 ; it
is not demurrable, 11 Neb. 192, and relief may bo had without it,
1 Bull 91 ; 5 Rec. 428. The plaintifff can not have a greater
amount than he asks for, 31 O. S. 87; and if the verdict Is for a
greater amount, the excess must be remitted before judKment
may be allowed, 6 N. Y. 97 ; and it is error to render judgment
for a greater amount unless the petition has been umended
before verdict so as to cover it, 61 Mo. 19.
Petitions in particular cases. Account. See \ 5086. A petition
which states that there is due to the plaintifff from an unincor
porated association a certain sum on an account for articles fur
nished to said association, as shown by an account attached to
the petition, and that the defendant was a member of said asso
ciation when the debt was contracted and knew of and con
sented thereto, states a good cause of action against said
defendant, 2 C. C. R. 340.
Animals. In an action for injury by dogs to sheep scienter need
not be averred, 13 O. S. 485 (act 1852). and separate ownership
may be charged as joint, 24 O. S. 333 (S. & S. 10). Iu an action
against a railroad company to recover damages for injuries to
stock bv reason of the neglect of the company to construct and
maintain a sufficient fence, an allegation in the petition that
defendant was by law bound to fence, etc., is immaterial and
not admitted by failure to deny it, 31 O. S. 555.
Assault and battery. Malice may be shown without averring it,
19 O. S. 572, and the permanency of the injury need not be
specially pleaded, 37 O. S. 10. Special damages must be averred,
31 Mo. 117, as costs and expenses incurred, Id. Attorneys' fees
are recoverable as damages, 37 O. S. 10, and physicians' bills,
though paid by others, 19 O. S. 569. A cause of action for
assault and battery may be joined with one for false imprison
ment, 6 Kas. 94. The injury is personal. Several can not unite
in the action, Bliss Code PI. § 26.
Bailment. Demand and refusal must be made and averred to
terminate the bailment, 9 Johns. 361 ; but not in cases of wrong
ful conversion or loss by gross negligence, 30 Ark. 428 ; 27 Mo.
549. A tender of the amount due on a pledge must be averred by a pledgor to recover it against a bona fide purchaser without
notice from the pledgee, 93 U. S. 321, and a tender of the amount
due must be averred in an action to redeem a pledge, 3 Nev. 228.
Bills and notes. It is not necessary to aver consideration in
actions on bills and notes. Consideration is imported, 18 O. S.
516. Under § 5086 it is sufficient to set forth a copy of the instru
ment with the indorsements thereon, and to state that there is
due to plaintifff from the adverse party a specified sum with
interest ; and when others than the makers or acceptors of a bill
or note are parties it is necessary to state the facts which fix
their liability. A failure to state the amount due und^r this
section renders the petition demurrable, 1 Clev. R. 144, 147. It
seems sufficient to attach.a copy without incorporating the bill
or note in the petition, 4 Bull 852; 8 Rec. 309; see 27 O. S. 421,
425. The extrinsic facts which show the plaintifff's right or title
need not be expressly averred. The allegation of title is im
plied by force of the statute in the statement that there is due
to him a specified amount on the note which he claims, Swan's
PI.&Pr.l86; 32O. S. 449; 5 Bull 793. It is not sufficient to give
a copy of the note in an action by one other than the payee
against the maker; he must give a copy of the note with the
indorsements to entitle him to the protection given to a bona
fide indorsee for value and before maturity, 31 O. S. 193. In an
action against the maker of a note or acceptor of a bill of ex
change in which a place is fixed for payment it is not necessary
to aver presentment at that place and refusal to pay, 11 Cal. 307;
9 W. Va. 373 ; nor is an averment of demand necessary on a note
payable on demand, 9 O. S. 517 ; 17 O. 9; but in an action against
an indorser presentment and demand of payment at the place
specified is necessary to charge him, 5 How.Pr. 107. An aver
ment that the note was presented to the maker at maturity for
payment and payment thereof demanded, and the same was not
paid, of all of which the indorser had due notice, is a sufficient
averment of presentment, refusal, and notice, 63 Cal. 302; see 1
H. 29; 2 W. L. Gaz. 388; or that at the maturity of the note the
maker could not be found after due diligence and inquiry, and
that it was not paid, of all of which the indorser had due
notice, Bates PI. 310; and where the indorser has sufficient
effects of the maker to indemnify him against payment of the
note the petition should aver that no demand was made on the
maker, or notice of payment or non-payment given to the in
dorser, because at the maturity of the note the indorser had
sufficient effects of the maker in his possession to indemnify
him against payment, Id.; 32 O. S. 29 ; 33 0. S. 295. The destruc
tion or loss of a note need not be averred if a copy is given in
the pleading, 32 O. S. 449.
Bond. In averring the execution of a bond the statute need
not be set forth, W. 722; and when pleaded the words of the
statute need not be followed, 25 O. S. 567. An averment of
approval is not necessary, 17 Minn. 451 ; see 22 O. S. 527; Id. 317,
320. Stating that it was executed pursuant to an order of court
filed with the clerk, and that thereupon the order secured by it
issued, is a sufficient averment of approval on general demurrer,
1 O. S. 190, 196 ; 9 O. S. 17, 24. No consideration need be averred
in actions on statutory bonds, though not under seal, 62 Barb.
175; S. C. 12 Abb. Pr. N. S. 324. Where an undertaking is given
in pursuance of a statute, and no demand is required by the terms of the instrument, no Such averment is necessary in the
petition in an action upon the undertaking, 40 Abb. Pr. 22; but
if the condition of a bond is to pay on demand, a demand must
be averred. 5 Hill 143: 15 Q. B. 418; and a demand or an excuse
for the want of it is necessary in an action on the bond of an
officer for withholding monies, 5 O. S. 87, 90. Matter consti
tuting a breach must be pointed out, 6 O. 150. It is, however, a
sufficient allegation of a breach as against a demurrer to set
forth the condition alleged to have been broken and aver its
non-performance, 27 O. S. 366: but if the condition requires a
compliance with the terms of another obligation not fully stated
in the condition, the pleading must set out such obligation with
the corresponding breach, 17 O. 436. In an action ou a bond of
indemnity, conditioned that the principal obligor shall pay any
judgment recovered against the obligee, the measure of the
recovery is the amount of the judgment, and It is not necessary
to aver or prove payment of the judgment by the obligee prior
to the beginning of the action, 42 O. S. 508. In an action on a
sheriff's bond for failure to levy an execution on chattels It
must be averred that the chattels were within the bailiwick and
might have been seized, 88 Ind. 5h7.
Breach of promise of marriage. The petition must allege that
the promise was mutual, 12 How. Pr. 504, and that plaintifff was
ready and willing to fulfill the contract. 64 Ind. 507. PIaintiff
need not aver a tender—a readiness is sufficient, 2 W. I.. M. 98
(except in case of a male plaintifff. Id.); but if the promise was
to marry on a day named the petition need not aver a request
for performance, 84 Ind. 3, 6; nor where the defendant has
renounced his promise, 42N. Y.246; 76 Ind. 594; L. R. 7 Ex. Ill
(when a right of action arises immediately thereon, though the
time fixed for the performance has not passed, Id.; see 33 O. d.
147, 149) ; nor where the petition avers a marriage of the defend
ant to another, 15 M. & \V. 189. In averring the marriage of the
defendant to another it is not necessary to aver that such other
is still living, 8 Q. B. 358 ; and when the defendant represented
himself to be unmarried it is not necessary to aver that he
knew his representations to be false, 29 Barb. 222; 7 Abb. Pr.
403. Special damages must be averred to be recovered, 13
Barb. 183, as loss of health, Id.; seduction bv means of the
promise. 76 Ind. 594; 37 Wis. 46; see 11 O. S. 330; disappointment
dI reasonable expectations, injury to feelings and affections,
etc., 13 Allen 145; 102 Mass. 399; though hiss of lime and ex
penses in preparation for the marriage need not be specially
averred, 4 Gush. 408. Infancy is a good defense. :;! O. S. 521 ; but
where a promise was alleged to have been made at a certain
time, to which the defendant pleaded infancy, it was held not
error for the court to permit an amended petition to be filed
stating other promises and a ratification of the first promise
after the defendant became of age, 16 Neb. 510; see 15 Bull 305.
('ornmon carrier. An averment that defendant, a common
carrier, accepted the plaintifff as a passenger, conveys an implied
agreement that the plaintifff will pay the fare and that the
carrier will carry him safely, and no averment to that effect
is necessary, 68 Mo. 340. A petition alleging that defendants
were common carriers by omnibus or stage, and that they
undertook to carry the plaintifff for hire, was held to be suffi
cient without alleging that they received compensation from other passengers, 58 N. Y. 613. In an action against a carrier of
passengers to recover damages for refusal to carry the plaintifff,
it is not necessary to allege a tender of fare. It is sufficient to
allege that plaintifff was ready and willing to pay the defendant
such sum as it was legally entitled to charge, 34 Cal. 616. A
petition under an act prescribing a penalty for charging excess
ive fare is not bad tor want of an averment that the purchaser
of the ticket was in fact transported on the ticket tor which
excessive fare was exacted, nor that the excessive fare was paid
by the plaintifff in the due course of business, 37 O. S. 265. A
petition in an action by a passenger for carrying him past a
station must aver that the train should have stopped at such
station, or that by a special contract the company had agreed to
carry him to that station and let him off there, 67 Ind. 12. In
charging a common carrier with loss or injury to goods deliv
ered to it for transportation, it must be averred that defendant
is a common carrier, 9 Barb. 158 ; that the goods were delivered
to it, 10 Ala. 221 ; and that it accepted and undertook to carry
them, 1 Port. 107. A petition which alleges a delivery of the
goods by the owner to the carrier, and their acceptance by such
carrier, to be carried from one place to another for reward, the
loss of such goods, and that the loss was occasioned by the
negligence of the carrier, stating the value of the goods and the
damage to the plaintifff, states a good cause of action, 10 Minn.
418. Where the petition avers a general contract and the proof
shows a special contract, the variance is fatal and plaintifffcan not
recover, 90 Ind. 459; 28O.S.418. Where the carrier claims exemp
tions from its common law liability under a bill of lading not
signed by the owner or consignor, it must aver and prove that
such bill was assented to by the shipper, 28 O. S.418. Plaintiffmay
sue on the contract or in tort, 31 O. S. 537,542,543. The real owner
or one with whom the contract is made may sue on the contract,
but only the former in tort, Bates PI. 372. When a passenger
sues for exemplary damages, he must sue in tort and not on the
contract, Id. In tort against a carrier it is not necessary to
allege that compensation was paid or agreed to be paid for
carrying goods, 36 N. H. 26; and when a carrier's liability is
restricted by special contract, when sued in tort, the special
contract need not be noticed, 64 Mo. 440.
Contract, The petition should allege its execution, breach,
and damages for which plaintifff asks judgment, 38 Ind. 175.
The circumstances attending the contract and its execution need
not be set forth, 66 N. Y. 214 ; but the facts constituting the
breach must be pleaded, 62 Ind. 259. In pleading an account or
instrument for the unconditional payment of money, see § 5086.
In an action for money due upon a contract, the petition must
show that the claim "or sum of money is due and unpaid, 87
Ind. 126.
Concersion. It is sufficient to aver that the defendant "con
verted" the property to his own use, 33 Hun 34, or that he
"took and carried away " the goods, 48 Cal. 152; without stating
the particular acts constituting the conversion, 63 How. Pr.
471. A petition by a guardian alleging that "his wards were
owners in fee simple of a certain woodland, that the timber
thereon was cut down and removed by a person unknown and
without any authority whatever, and that the same was taken
and possessed for its own use, and without any authority what" ever, by a certain railroad company, which company was after
wards consolidated with another railroad company," constitute*
a good cause of action for the conversion of personal property,
37 O. S. 282. It is sufficient to allege ownership generally with
out stating the facts showing plaintifff's title, 64 How. Pr. 117;
77 N. Y. 158; and ownership must be alleged as of the time of
the conversion, 31 Minn. 119: but if forcible and wrongful tak
ing from plaintifff's possession is set forth, ownership need not
be alleged, 6 Bosw. 154. An allegation of actual possession in the
plaintifff and wrongful detention from him is sufficient. 11 How.
Pr. U. While it is usual tn allege the value of the pniiierty
converted, see 2 E. D. Smith 314, a failure to do so will lie cured
by a verdict for the plaintifff, 31 Ark. 286. Demand and refusal
should be alleged where the defendant has come rightfully into
possession. W. 337; but where the bona fide buyer has sold and
delivered the goods demand by the owner is not necessary to
a suit for the conversion, fil N. V. 477. The property should be
described with reasonable certainty, 23 N. H. 555. The measure
of damages is the value of the property at the time of its eonversion, with interest, 7 O. S. 299, 308; for conversion of notes,
their face value, but the amount may be reduced by showing
insolvency, 16 O. S. 382. An innocent purchaser of timber is
only liable for its value before cut, 32 O. S. 71 ; 37 Id. 282, though
the title was held under a decree of court which was subse
quently reversed, 1 C. 0. R. 155. The owner may waive the tort
and sue on the implied contract, 49 Mo. 570; but to sue for
money had and received in such case, plaintifff must allege and
show that the goods have been disposed of by the wrong doer
for value, 7 Hun 525 ; 31 Ark. 155; contra, 66 Barb. 353.
Covenant. Eviction under a better title or something equiva
lent is necessary, and must be alleged in an action on a cove
nant of warranty, 17 O. 66; 2 H. 86, 93; 10 O. 382. Where a
breach of warranty is set up as a counterclaim under § 5780, in
actions for the recovery of purchase money, the person claiming
a paramount title must be made a party, but if he is in posses
sion he can not be compelled to litigate in the action, 35 O. S.
289. Such counterclaim can only be set up where there has
been a breach, 28 O. S. 39. In an action on a covenant against
encumbrances, the encumbrances relied on should be averred,
11 Johns. 6. An eviction need not be averred or proved in such
action, 23 O. S. 584. Payment to free premises from dower is
not sufficient. It must be averred that dower has been set off, 17
O. 71. In an action on a covenant of seizin, eviction must be
averred. Negativing the covenant or the legal seizin at the date
of the covenant does not aver a breach, 23 O. S. 5s4, 588; 31
O. S. 574. Answer, see 3 C C. R. 177.
Death by negligence. While the action can not be maintained
for a death occurring outside of Ohio, 2 C. S. C. R. 82, the peti
tion need not aver that it occurred in Ohio, Id.; 2 H. 110 ; 25 O. S.
667 ; nor set forth the injury to the widow or next of kin, 7 O. S.
336; but to recover damages for injury to the business of de
ceased, a special averment is necessary, 10 Rec. 4 14 ; 2W.L.Q.1;
see 7 O. S. 336, 340 ; 15 O. S. 553 ; 2 W. L. M. 593 ; 1 D. 257. The action
is in form ex delicto and barred in four years from the time the
cause of action accrued. The foundation of the action is the
injury and not the death alone, and the cause of action accrues
04 the time the injury is received, 2 C. C. R. 45. The action may be brought on behalf of a bastard, 10 O. S. 272; and for the bene
fit of the next of kin, who had no claim for support upon
deceased, 25 O. S. 510. Hut a recovery can not be had in the
name of the beneficiaries, 25 O. S. 522. Causing death by intoxi
cation is not within the statute, 3I O. S. 359; 35 O. S. 389.
Deceit. The petition must allege that defendant intended to
deceive plaintifff, 26 O. S. 428; 15 O. 659: that the representa
tions were made to plaintifff, or to his agent, 10 O. B. 67; cf. 15 O.
o59; that plaintifff relied on the representations and was de
ceived by them, 40 lnd. 90; and that the injury arose by the
misrepresentations, 6 O. 497.
Executor and administrator. See Representative Capacity, supra. In an action by an executor or administrator, he must aver
his appointment, 1 W. L. M. 155; but it is not necessary to state
the particulars of his appointment or qualification, 27 O. S. 366
(§6214) ; nor to make profert of letters testamentary. 1 W. L. M.
155; and where an executor or administrator sues on a note or
contract, made with him as such, he need not allege hisappointment, 33 Barb. 27; and in an action against an executor, upon
an instrument executed by him as such executor, it is sufficient
to allege that fact without setting forth the particulars of his ap
pointment, 61 How. Pr. 494. Under §6166, when a petition is
filed for the sale of an equitable estate, or any equitable interest
which the deceased held in any lands, the executor or adminis
trator shall set forth in the petition the nature of such equitable
estate or interest, making all necessary parties, including the
persons holding the legal title theretoand those who are entitled
to the purchase money therefore. Under § 6141, a petition by an
executor or administrator to sell lands to pay debts must set
forth the amount of debts due from the deceased, as nearly as
they can be ascertained, and the amount of the charges of ad
ministration, the value of the personal estate ai.d effects and
a description of the real estate, and the value thereof, if anpraised. Under § 6108. an executor or administrator of deceased
is not liable to the suit of a creditor until after the lapse of
eighteen months from the date of his administration bond, or
the further time allowed by the court for the collection of the
assets of the estate, unless it be for the recovery of a demand
that would not be affected by the insolvency of the estate, or
unless it be brought after the estate has been represented
insolvent for the purpose of ascertaining a claim that is con
tested; or unless the claim has been exhibited to the executor
or administrator, and has been disputed or rejected by him. A
petition in an action against an executor or administrator
under this section must aver the lapse of eighteen months,
etc., or that the claim was within the exceptions, 3 W. L. M. 134 ; 2
C. S. C. R. 144. §6210, 6211, provide for actions by creditors' leg
atees, distributees, etc., on administration bonds, on failure on
demand of personal representatives to pay their claims against
the estate. Under thesestatutes the petition must allege plaint
iff's right to a sum liquidated by allowance, judgment, order, or
award, 28 O. S. 175. g 6214, providing for an action on an execu
tor's bond by an administrator de bonis non, does not require
that such administrator obtain leave to sue, 27 O S. 366, 369;
and on demurrer the petition is sufficient if it alleges his ap
pointment by the proper authority without averring that he
had given bond. Id.; and it is sufficient to set forth the condition of the bond alleged to have been broken, and to aver
non-performance of such condition, Id. When the action in
against the surviving obligors and the administrator of a
deceased obligor, the petition must aver the lapse of eighteen
months, unless the case comes within the exceptions provided
in \ 6108, 12 O. S. 252. When the action is by a creditor on an
administration bond, the petition must aver a demand or an
excuse for its omission, 17 O. 161 ; but when it in against an
executor upon a bond given by him as residuary legatee for
the payment of debts and legacies, the petition need not show
a presentment of the claim for allowance or rejection. 13 O. S.
525 (act 1840).
False imprisonment. The petition must aver that the defend
ant imprisoned the plaintifff against his will and without
authority of law. 15 How. Pr. 261. Want of probable cause need
not be averred, 14 O. S. 213 ; 37 O. S. 47;i; nor that the acts were
illegal, wrongful, or without competent authority, 39 Ind. 32*.
An action for false imprisonment may be changed by amend
ment into one for malicious prosecution,3 Bull 1)39, and vice
versa, 14 O. S. 213, and a cause of action for false imprisonment
may be joined with one for malicious prosecution when they
arise out of the same transaction, 93 N. Y. 515.
Fraudulent conveyance. In un action to set aside a fraudulent
conveyance, the petition must aver that the conveyance was
made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, 30 (). s.
U; 1 O. S. 1 ; 9 O. S.430;.md must describe the property with
such definiteness as to enable it to be identified, 2 Wall. 237.
Where the petition shows that the conveyance was made more
than four years prior to the action, it must be averred that the
fraud was not discovered within that period. 32 O. S. 228; 2
C. S. C. R. 523. But the petition need not aver that there is no
other property out of which to make the claim by execution, 29
O. S. 597; 25 O. S. 500; nor that the creditor has reduced his
claim to judgment. 32 O. S. 228 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 523.
Guaranty. A guarantor of a note is entitled to notice, 2 O.
430. but an absolute guaranty requires no notice, and no aver
ment of demand and notice is requisite to make a prima facie
case for recovery upon it. 19 O. S. 549 ; arid notice is not required
where the letter of credit binds the writer to pay, 12 O. S. 273.
The guarantor of the collectibility of a note requires notice. 4
O. S. 263; but demand and notice at the maturity of the note
need not be averred, 14 O. S. 246. In an action on a guaranty of
payment or collection of a debt, it is not necessary to aver that
the promise 'was in writing, 29 Cal. 597. It will be presumed to
have been made in writing until the contrary appears by the
answer, 2 Minn. 277. In an action on a guaranty of prompt pay
ment it is not sulhcient to state that the principal debtor has not
paid without stating that the defendant, the guarantor, has not
paid, 50 Cal. 520. When notice of the acceptance of an offer of
guaranty is requisite.au allegation of notice in the petition in
an action on such guaranty should be specific, and such as will
enable the court to determine from its statements whether or
not the notice was given as the law requires. 4 Met. iKy.)147;
a general averment "of all of which defendant had notice" is
not sufficient, Id. In an action on a conditional guaranty, the
petition must show that the condition has happened which
made the defendant liable, 60 Cal..235.
Inn-keeper. The petition must allege that the plaintifff is a
guest and was entertained by defendants as inn-keepers for com
pensation, 2 C. S. C. R. 58. In an action to recover for loss of
goods, it is not necessary to aver a demand before action, nor to
aver negligence, 2 E. D. Smith 148. But in pleading under
§ 4427, 80 v. 164, providing for exemption from liability unless
certain articles are delivered to the safe-keeping of the inn
keeper, negligence must be averred, 98 U. S. 218.
Insurance, Fire, The petition must allege that the loss arose
from the peril insured against, 16 Gray 249; and where a com
pliance with the conditions of the policy, as to notice, proof of
loss and damage, is precedent to a right of recovery, it must be
averred in the petition, 26 O. S. 348, and proved, 37 O. S. 49 ; but
it is sufficient to plead the performance of such conditions gen
erally, 33 O. S. 555; and if there is nothing in the terms of the
policy requiring the truth of the representations in the applica
tion therefore to be averred as precedent to a right of action, a
good cause of action may be made in the petition founded on
the policy without setting forth the application and averring the
truth of the representations therefore, Id. It is not necessary to
aver that the insurer refused to rebuild or replace the property,
Id. Where the policy provides that no action shall be com
menced within a certain time after the loss, and the action is
begun after that time, the petition must show why the limita
tion clause was not complied with, or it is demurrable, 1 dev.
R. 134, 216. It has been held that the petition must aver that the
party has an insurable interest in the property at the time of its
destruction by fire, 14 Abb. Pr. 398, or at the time of effecting the
insurance, 9 Jones & S. 279; audit has also been held that the
petition must allege an insurable interest in the property at
the time it was insured and at the time of the loss, 46 Ind.
315; 75 Ind. 535. Where, in an action upon a policy of fire in
surance, it appears from the petition that the insurance com
pany for a specified preminm executed and delivered a policy
insuring A against loss by fire on specific property occupied by
the insured, an insurable interest in the insured is sufficiently
shown, 24 O. S. 331, 332. The value of the property at the time
of the loss must oe alleged, but it is not necessary to aver its
value when the insurance was taken, 87 Ind. 132; 46 Ind. 315.
Where a policy of fire insurance contains a provision that the
loss, if any, shall be paid to a person other than the insured, it
is not sufficient in an action on the policy for such beneficiary
to allege and prove that he complied with the terms thereof and,
suffered loss by fire, but it should have been alleged and proved,
that the insured complied with the terms of the policy aud suf
fered loss, 17 Bull 3.,7 ; see 46 O. S.
§ 21 Bull 385 ( lAfr. Ins.)
Insurance, Life. 1'laintiffmust aver the making of the policy,
its terms, the payment of the preminm, the death, aud notice
and proof of the same. These averments, if established, consti
tute a prima facie case, S. (". 111., 24 C. L. J. 390. It is unneces
sary to aver that the death of the insured was not caused by the
breaking of any of the conditions of the policy, 9 Abb. N. C. 309 ;
85 N. Y. 236 ; nor, in an action on a policy procured by the in
sured for the benefit of the plaintifff, that plaintifff had any inter
est in the life of the insured, 80 111. 35; see 41 O. S. 232; but
where he procures an insurance on the life of another he must
aver that he had an insurable interest in the life insured, Id.
Where it is sought to reform the contract by reason of fraud or
mistake, the same should be averred in the petition, 15 Bull 197.
Judgment, Since domestic statutes are public acts of which
the courts take judicial notice, ueither jurisdiction nor personal
service need be averred in suing on them, 31 Iud. 376 ; 9 Kas. 658 ;
39 N. H. 352 ; nor is it necessary to allege jurisdiction of the sub
ject matter or of the defendant in pleading a foreign judgment
of a court of record, 2 C. S. C. R. 134 ; 8 Cowen 311 ; U Cush. 277 ;
and if such averment were required, an averment that the court
was one of general jurisdiction would be sufficient without
averring the jurisdiction of the person. 9 Blatch. 274 ; see 27 O. S.
600 ; 1 C. S. C. R. 17. If the petition sets forth the name of the
court, the date or term at which the judgment was recovered,
and the amount of the recovery, it will be sufficient without
stating the proceedings, 7 Colo. 561, or the facts conferring juris
diction, 30 Hun 260. It is not necessary to state that the judg
ment sued on remains in full force, 2 C. S. C. R. 134 ; 9 la. 592 ;
nor that execution has been issued on it and an unsuccessful
effort made to collect it, 4 Bull 215; 6 O. 521. As there is no
presumption that courts of justices of other states are or are not
courts of record, 13 O. 209, their jurisdiction must be specially
pleaded, 7 Wend. 435 ; 20 Tex. 456. In an action by an assignee
of a judgment, an averment of the assignment of the judgment
is necessary, 7 Colo. 583: but it is not necessary to allege any
demand of payment by the assignee or any refusal to pay by the
debtor, 1 Hilt. 175 ; nor a consideration for the transfer of the
judgment, 30 Ind. 481; 29 Id. 481. Where a petition to vacate a
judgment avers that the judgment was procured to be entered
on default for answer without evidence for a demand not
founded on contract, express or implied, and its averments
are admitted by demurrer, it discloses fraud in the prevailing
party stating a ground for vacation, 2 C. C. R. 143.
Landlord andttnard. In an action for use and occupation, it is
not necessary to aver in the petition how the relation of landlord
and tenant arose between the parties, 22 How. Pr. 104. The
plaintifff may declare for use and occupation and recover on the
special facts shown, 12 Abb. Pr. 103. In debt or covenant on a
lease it is not necessary to set forth the lessor's title, Chitty PI.
376. Where there is a lease under seal the action must be upon
the demise to recover the rent reserved ; and an action for use
and occupation can not be maintained. 69 N. Y. 343. An action
for rent must be for all installments due, but if separate actions
are brought, objection must be made before trial, 40 O. S. 322.
Libel and slander. The petition should aver that the defama
tory words were published.or spoken of the plaintifff, 6 Duer 688,
setting forth the precise words published and not their purport,
3 O. 409: that they were published maliciously, 57 N. Y. 119 ; and
where the libel or slander is not actionable per se, aver special
damages, 65 Barb. 627. Where the publication is not defamatory
on its face, but becomes so only by reference to extrinsic facts,
the existence
those by
factsnatural
must be
alleged, 14 tend
How. toPr.injure
265;
bu•.
when theofwords,
construction,
the plaintifff's reputation, or to subject him to hatred, ridicule, or
contempt, no extrinsic averment is necessary, 48 N. Y. 472.
When the words are published in a foreign language they should
be set forth in such language, accompanied by a translation of
their meaning in English, 3 Wend. 394, and the petition should aver that they were understood by those who heard them, Id.;
20 Wis. 239, unless, perhaps, they were published in a place
where such language is commonly used, W. 107. Such averment
is not necessary when the words are published in English, for
the word '' publish " implies the presence of hearers, 51 Ind. 581.
Where the special damages are the loss of customers or of the sale
of property, it has been held that the petition should set out the
names of such customers or persons who refused to purchase, or
no cause of action is stated, 11 Abb. Pr. u. s. 388 ; 2 Barb. 530 ; 6
Neb. 254 ; but see L. R. 1 Ex. Div. 91 ; 3 Zabr. 402 : 94 N. Y. 15.
In charging adultery it must be averred that one of the parties
was married at the time of the crime, 48 Vt. 65 ; see Bates PI. 521.
In charging perjury at a trial before a justice of the peace.it
must be alleged that the justice had jurisdiction, and that the
plaintifff was sworn to testify, but it need not be averred that
his testimony was about a matter material to the issue, 50 Ind.
129. In charging injury to one in his vocation, it need not be
averred that plaintifff was in receipt of emolument, as that he
was a paid preacher, 27 O. S. 202, 205 ; but it must be alleged
that the wordswere used " in reference to his profession," 50 Ga.
238, or of and concerning his trade, 31 Me. 321. In au action for
slander of titte, plaintifff must show title or interest in the prop
erty, 3 Taunt. 24(i ; 00 Cat. 157 ; must aver malice, 5 N. Y. 14 ; want
of probable cause, 5 Kas. 141 ; 5 Barb. 297 ; see 3 Abb. Ct. App. 62 ;
and allege special damages, 41 Barb. 186 ; and where the special
damages are the loss of a sale or. loan, the persons who refused
to loan or purchase must be named, 1 1iuer. 670 ; 5 Barb. 297.
Lien, mechanic's. A full compliance with the statute must be
shown, 30 Ark. 282. The petition should describe the property
to be charged and allege that the defendant had an interest in
it, 24 Wis. 563 : that the materials were furnished for the build
ing sought to be charged with the lien ; it is not suffi
cient to aver that they were furnished to the contractor or
owner and were used in the construction of the building,
73 Ind. 60 ; 24 Wis. 563 ; that the labor was performed under tne
contract, express or implied, 1 Mont. T. 224; that the contract
was made with the owner or his agent, 35 Mo. 107; 24 Minn. 300;
27 Wis. 456. or owner or lessee, 27 Mich. 456 (and it is held an
omission of this defect can not be cured by answer. Id.); that
something was due for the services on which the lien was
founded at the time the suit was commenced, 67 How. Pr. 130;
and that the lien was filed within the time limited before the
commencement of the action. 21 Ind. 344 ; 30 Ark. 682.
Liquor taws, § 4357 provides that a party deprived of the
usual means of support, etc., by or in consequence of the intoxi
cation or the acts ol an intoxicated person, may bring an action
against the seller of the liquor causing the intoxication, the
owner of the premises in which the liquor was sold, or the
lessor having knowledge of its sale, 25 O. S. 352 ; 4 Rec. 670 ; and
§ 4358 provides that notice to the seller, owner, etc.. shall be
given as a condition precedent to the maintenance of the action,
see 42 O. S. 52. It is sufficient under these sections to set forth
the statutory grounds in the petition, 21 O. S. 08. The defend
ants may be jointly. 40 O. S. 43. or severally liable, 31 O. S. 419.
The action does not lie for causing death under I 6134 ; 35 O. S.
85; 31 O. S. 359. For pleading in criminal cases, see 3 O. S. 475;
4 Id. 467 ; 8 O. S. 391 ; 4 Id. 477, 4S7 ; 24 O. S. 175. Under the Scott Malicious prosecution: The petition must aver that the pros
ecution was malicious, W. 725; 50 How. Pr. 105, want of prob
able cause therefore, 3 W. L. M. 324 ; 100 Moss. 195, and a termina
tion of the prosecution in favor of the plaintifff, W. 725; 8 O. S.
548, 550; see 20 O. 119. Special damages to be recovered must be
set out with particularity, 60 111. 361, as lawyers' fees, 12 Wend.
64, loss of reputation, credit, or business, 78 Pa. St. 73. The
action may be joined with one for slander, 15 O. S. 173, or false
imprisonment, when arising out of the same transaction, 10
Hun 580, and may be changed by amendment to an action for
false imprisonment, 14 O. S. 213, and vice cersa, 3 Bull 1 139. The
burden of proof is on the plaintifff to show want of probable
cause and malice, 103 Pa. St. 151. When there has been no
arrest of the person or seizure of the property, and no special
injury sustained, the action will not lie, 2 IX 391; 40 N. J. L.
252; 90 Pa. St. 259; see 9 O. 103, 104; 46 O. S.
§ 21 Bull 372L
Master and servant. In an action by a servant against the
master for injuries caused by the use of defective machinery or
tools, he must allege in his petition that he was employed by the
defendant, 20 Barb. 449; that the master had notice or knowl
edge of the defect or danger, or ought to have known, or that he
would have discovered it had he exercised reasonable diligence
or taken proper precaution, Bates PI. 562; citing 48 Me. 113; 56
Barb. 151; 31 Ind. 174; that plaintifff was ignorant of the de
fect, and exercised due care and diligence in the use of
machinery, etc., 5 O. R. 541; but see Negligence, infra; and where
the action is for injuries caused by the negligence of a fellowservant, plaintifff must allege in his petition that defendant was
negligent in selecting or retaining such servant after knowledge
of his incompetency, 51 Cal. 116; 8 Kas. 658 ; 58 Ind. 26.
Money had and receiced. A form of petition under the com
mon counts has been Held good under the code, 7 N. Y. 476, as
of money had and received by the defendant to and for the
plaintifff's use, 29 Wis. 65 ; see 26 O. S. 127 ; that defendant is in
debted to plaintifff, etc., for goods sold and delivered to him at
his request, and that defendant has not paid, 32 Cal. 172. An
allegation of a request ordemand for the payment of the money,
63 Cal. 394, or of non-payment, 6O Ind. 188 ; 50 Cal. 5L'0, though
usual, is not required, but it is better to make it in the latter
case, otherwise no breach is averred, Bates PI. 121, 574. Under
§ 4272, to recover back money lost at gambling, the petition
should aver that the money was lost at gaming, paid or deliv
ered to the defendant or otherwise received by him, 33 How. Pr.
262, and state the aggregate amount won, 1 7 O. S. 464.
Murtoaae. Foreclosure. The petition must show that the debt
secured by the mortgage is due and owing the plaintifff, 11 N. J.
Eq. 27. Where a personal judgment is sought and the action is
on the mortgage and the note secured by it, the plaintifff should
aver that the defendant is indebted to him on the note, etc., set
ting forth or attaching a copy with the indorsements under
§ 5086 ; that the defendant executed and delivered to him the
mortgage to secure its payment, 14 Kas. 101, setting out a copy
of the mortgage in substance, 65 Ind. 302 (it is not necessary to
attach a copy ; see Bates Pi. 579) ; and pray for a judgment for
the amount due, § 5021 ; 31 O. S. 80, and that the premises may
be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the judg
ment. It is not necessary to aver a record of the mortgage when the action is against the original mortgagor, 13 How. Pr. 95; nor
when defendant is a subsequent purchaser of the mortgaged
premises, who is alleged in the petition to have assumed the
payment of the mortgage debt as part of the purchase money, 63
Ind. 44. An averment that the note and mortgage were duly
assigned to plaintifff is sufficient without setting out a copy of
the assignment, 34 la. 452 ; see 4 O. 318 ; IC.S. C. R. 378 ; and as
the assignment of the note carries the mortgage, 4 O. 318 ; 1 C. S.
C. R. 378, where the petition shows an assignment of the debt,
it need not show an assignment of the mortgage, 6 Kas. 395.
Where the debt secured by the mortgage is payable on demand,
demand before suit to foreclose need not be shown, 35 O. S. 357"
but if the mortgage securing a demand note is to be void if
the note is paid "within sixty days after such demand," an
averment of demand at least sixty days before buH to fore
close is necessary, Id. 313. The petition should state whether
the other notes have been paid, and if not by whom they are
held and the dates of their maturity, 9 Porter (Ala.) 79; and if
the note has been renewed that fact must be stated, 31 Conn. 74.
If there are infant defendants the petition should allege their
interests. 6 How. Pr. 129. An averment that a party who is made
a co-defendant with the mortgagor has, or claims to have, some
interest in or lion upon the mortgaged premises, which, what
ever it is, is subject to the lien of the plaintifff's mortgage, is suf
ficient without an averment of the character of the interest, 20
Kas. 624 ; 16 How. Pr. 424 ; but an averment in an action to fore
close against a person other than the mortgagor, that "he is
now the owner of the land," is not sufficient to show that the
mortgage constitutes a lien on the land as against him, since he
may have acquired the land before the mortgage was executed,
89 Ind. 54. The petition in an action against an administrator
to enforce the lien should aver the presentation of the mortgage
claim for allowance, 46 Cal. 222. Plaintiff should pray for a
judgment for the deficiency, if any shall exist, against a pur
chaser or assignor or guarantor of the mortgage who may be lia
ble for the debt, 12 Abb. Pr. 831.
Mortgage. Redemption. The petition must show that plaintifff
has an interest in the equity of redemption, 47 Mich. 28; and
when other than the mortgagor, the nature and derivation of
his title, 9 Mich. 465 ; that the plaintifff was not a party defend
ant In the foreclosure suit, 50 Cal. 549; and aver a readiness to
pay or offer to pay whatever is found to be due, 60 Barb. 372;
and where an accounting of rents is sought, allege that the
plaintifff is ready and willing to redeem when the amount nec
essary to be paid therefore shall be ascertained, and intends so
to do, and thut he has demanded an accounting, which was re
fused, 87 Ind. 400.
Municipal corporation. When a municipal corporation is or
ganized under a general law, the fact of its existence must be
averred and proved, 02 Ind. 4 ; -13 la. 313. In Ohio such corpor
ations are organized under general laws. A description in the
petition of the defendant as a city is a sufficient averment that
it is a municipal corporation, 25 O. S. 143, 154; but when it is
desired to bring a city within a certain class, or as having a cer
tain population at a certain census, it is necessary to aver that
fact, 35 O. S. 319. As judicial notice is taken of the existence of
counties, no averment of corporate existence is required, l Bates
PI. 239. A city suing for a claim formerly duo a village from
-which it has been advanced to such city will not be required on
motion to set out in its petition the proceedings by which said
village was advanced to a city, 1 C. C. R. 340. In an action
against a city for injuries caused by defects or obstruction* in
its streets, the petition must allege notice or knowledge hy the cttr
of such defects or obKtructUins, or facts from which notice or knowledge can be reasonably inferred, 96 Ind. 51; 46 la. 567. Where
the petition fails to aver that the corporation negligently caused
the obstruction, or, not having caused the same, bad actual
notice of its existence and failed to remove it within a reason
able time ; or that, in the absence of actual notice, such obstruc
tion continued for such length of time prior to the injury that
notice was fairly to be inferred, it is bad on demurrer, 2 C. C. R.
145; Id. 366. And in an action against a municipal corporation
for injuries caused by falling on a sidewalk made slippery by
accumulations of snow and ice, the petition must show that the
city had notice, actual or constructive, of the condition of the
walk, and, having such notice, that it was its duty to remedy it,
44 O. S. 505; 16 Bull 453. Where by statute (§ 2326) plaintifff must
file a claim, for damages with the corporation prior to bringing
the action, such demand or claim must be averred in the peti
tion as a condition precedent to bringing the action, 5 O. 8. 523.
In an action to enforce a street assessment, where the petition
avers that the city council duly passed and published an ordi
nance, and that written notice thereof was caused by the city to
be duly served, etc., it contains, in the absence of a motion to
make more definite and certain and as against a general demur
rer, a sufficient averment of the valid passage and publication
of the resolution and proper service of a valid notice, 1 C. C. R.
90. In an action against a city for negligently changing the
grade of a street, an allegation that the city " raised the grade,"
is equivalent to an allegation that the grade was raised In pur
suance of an ordinance, since the city could only act in such
matters by ordinance, 78 Mo. 107 ; and an allegation that it had
before "fixed and established the grade as it was lawfully
authorized to do," is a sufficient statement of its establishment
without setting out the ordinance, 22 la. 590. M 1777 and 1778
provide for the bringing of actions to restrain the misapplica
tion of the funds of a municipal corporation or an abuse of its
corporate powers, by the city solicitor, or, on his failure on writ
ten request, by a tax-paver in his own name on behalf of the
corporation, 2 O. C. R. 237 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 44, 453. Where the peti
tion shows that the solicitor is acting as attorney in his official
capacity for a tax-payer in whose name the action is brought, it
need not be averred that he had been requested in writing by
the tax-payer to bring the action, 29 O. S. 291, and it is not neces
sary that the petition be signed b^ the city solicitor, 1 C. C. R.
340. In an action against a municipal corporation to recover
damages for injuries sustained from the discharge of a cannon
ia a public street by an assembly of disorderly persons, an alle
gation in the petition that the authorities of the corporation
" had negligently and carelessly given permission to such per
sons to fire the cannon " may be construed, in view of the whole
pleading, as an allegation that the authorities took no steps to
prevent such firing, 42 O. S. 625.
NtgUgence. It is not necessary to set out in the petition the facts constituting the negligence, 77 Mo. 232; 10 Minn. 418; 80
Ky. 82 ; 15 Fed. Rep. 588 ; 75 Mo. 295 ; nor the degree of negliSence, 10 How. Pr. 97; 47 Ind»368; but a bare allegation that
efendant was negligent has been held not sufficient, 29 Ind.
426 ; and in an action against a railroad company for negligence
in the management of its trains, it has been held that the peti
tion should show in what such negligence and carelessness con
sisted, and not charge the same in general terms without dis
closing any specific acts or omissions, 90 111. 425. So in an action
against a municipal corporation for injuries sustained by a de
fective sidewalk, the better practice is to set out in the petition
the dangerous character of the sidewalk, 2 C. C. R. 366. As a rule,
however, a general allegation of negligence is sufficient without
setting out the facts constituting it, 62 Ala. 494 ; 57 Ind. 297 ; 49
Mich. 380; 28 Minn. 69 ; 25 N. J. L. 381 ; and this is especially so
where the facts constituting the negligence lie more properly in
the knowledge of the defendant, 1 Sand. 89. Allegations of
malice are not necessary and will be treated as surplusage, 24 la.
336; 45 Mo. 371. The plaintifff is not, in this state, required to
allege in his petition tliat he was without fault "unless the
other averments necessary to constitute a causeof action suggest
the inference that he was guiltv of contributory negligence/' 40
O. S. 376 ; see 35 O. S. 627 ; 10 Bull 292. As to the sufficiency of
averments of a petition in an action against a railroad company
for injuries caused by the explosion of a torpedo negligently
exposed upon its track and picked up by a child nine years of
age, 4r, O. S.11; see 2 C. O. R. 504 : 45 O. S. 470 ; 46 O. S. 283.
Nuisance. The petition should state the facts constituting the
alleged nuisance, 3 O. S. 330; 11 O.S.362, 365; though it is not
necessary to detail all the particular injuries which result there
from, 61 Mo. 359. Where the action is against oue who continues
but who did not create the nuisance, it should be averred that
before the commencement of the action he had notice or knowl
edge of the existence of the nuisance, 51 N. Y. 573 ; 44 Me. 154 ;
but a request for its abatement is not necessary, 51 N. Y. 573.
Generally negligence need not be averred, 10 Am. Rep. 184 ; 2
N. Y. 159; though there are exceptions to this rule, 51 N. Y. 476;
68 Id. 283 ; 30 Vt. 610. Damages such as necessarily and nat
urally result from the injury need not be specially pleaded, 67
N. Y. 267, but damages which are the natural, though not the
necessary, result of the act complained of must be set forth
specially, 4 N. Y. 130; 21 Minn. 302; and when the alleged nui
sance is*a public one, special damages must be averred, 2 D. 516 ;
see 23 O. S. 523. Fish brine exposed in uninclosed yard near a
highway, petition stating no cause of action, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 216.
Partnership. A description of the firm as " a firm doing busi
ness under that name in the state of Ohio ". is sufficient under
§ 5011 without stating that it was formed for the purpose, etc., 2
C. S. C. R. 21. An assignment, by one partner, of the firm prop
erty in favor of a creditor of the firm made without authority of
his co-partners is void, 29 O. S. 441 ; and if the assignment is so
made with the authority or consent of the co-partner, it must
affirmatively appear in the petition, or the failure to give such
authority or consent satisfactorily explained, else the petition
will be bad on demurrer, 6 Pac. L. Rep. 367. A surviving part
ner may sue for the personal property and effects of the co-part
nership, 45 N. Y 786, and the petition in such action which alleges the existence of the co-partnership, the death of the co
partner, and the survivorship is sufficient. 16 Nev. 85. 8tnce
partners can not sue each other except after a settlement of
accounts, a balance struck, dissolution, or promise to p*y, the
petition must allege one of the exceptions in such an action, to
be available as against a demurrer, 57 How. Pr. 149.
Penalty. The facts constituting the offense must be specially
set out, 13 Johns. 428; but the petition need not set forth the
particular statute unless it is one not judicially noticed, 67 N. Y.
506 ; and it is sufficient to allege that the acts were fn violation
of the statutes, Id. Since municipal ordinances are not judi
cially noticed by the courts, 69 N. Y. 250; 23 Minn. 254, the
petition in an action for the violation of a municipal ordinance
should set out the offense charged and the substance of thai part
of the ordinance which has been violated, with a reference to
the title, date, or section, 40 Vt. 45); 9j Ind. 258; 49 Ind. 329 ; 14
Gray 52. The petition need not aver non-payment. 93 Ind. 118.
Under 71 v. 146, providing for the recovery of penalties for over
chaiges by railroad companies, a petition was held not bad on
demurrer for want of an averment that the purchaser of a ticket
was in fact transported on the ticket for which the excessive fare
was exacted, or that the excessive fare was paid by the plaintifff
in the due course of business, 37 O. S. 265. I nder S. & S. 669, pro
viding for actions by township trustees to recover a penalty for
obstructing public roads, where the obstruction was caused by
railroad cars or locomotives, it was held that the petition must
aver that tne road was obstructed unnecessarily by permitting
such pars, etc., to remain upon or across the public highway for
a longer period than five minutes, to the hindrance of, etc., 30
O. S. 62; but that in actions for obstructions to public roads
caused by agencies other than railroad cars or locomotives, the
word " unnecessarily " forms no essential part of the description
of the cause of action, Id. That several penalties may be recov
ered in one action, see 33 O. S. 384; 37 O. S. 265.
Physician and surgeon. A physician or surgeon does not in
sure a perfect cure, and an averment in the petition in an
action for malpractice that he had contracted to effect a perfect
cure must be sustained by proof of an express promise, 7 O. (Pt.
2) 123; 170. S. 253, 259; W. 351, 466. In such action an averment
that defendant was employed as a physician is sustained by
Eroof that he held himself out as "a cancer doctor," and as
aving skill and experience in the treatment and cure of can
cers. 29 O. S. 577. Proof that defendant accepted the employ
ment will sustain an averment that he was employed at "his
special instance and request," Id. It is unnecessary to allege a
consideration for the employment, 28 11i. 438 ; and since the lia
bility in case of malpractice does not arise out of any contract
or direct privity, but out of a duty, which the law imposes upon
the physician to avoid acts in their nature dangerous to the lives
of others, 6 N. Y. 397, the petition need not aver by whom the
defendant was employed. 46 Ind. 159. In an action by a hus
band for damages resulting to himself from injuries to his wife,
caused by malpractice, damages for loss of services which ap
pear necessarily to result from the nature of the injury may be
recovered as part of the general damages, without being'specially
pleaded, 32 Minn. 243. The cause of action does not survive the
surgeon's death, 2 W. L. M. 203 ; but after the action is begun, it does not abate, Bates PL 658 ; 29 O. S. 577. In an action for dam
ages for personal injuries, evidence as to the value of physician's
services is not admissible when they are not averred in the peti
tion, 1 C. C. R. 36.
Recognizance. The action is in the name of the state, 29 O. S.
452. The petition need not show the authority of the state to
sue, 10 Bee. 307. In an action on a forfeited recognizance, it is
not necessary to insert in the petition a copy of the order of for
feiture, nor to allege that the order of forfeiture was " duly
made," 14 Kas. 318. Copy to be attached to petition ; omission
taken advantage of by motion to make more definite, and not
ground of demurrer under the code, so held in 12 O. S. 60, 66.
Reformation. The petition must aver a mutual mistake, or a
mistake by one party and fraud by the other, 59 N. Y. 244 ; 14 W.
Va. 264. A statement merely showing the defective execution
of a mortgage will not suffice, 1 O. S. 110; and it is not error in
the court to fail to reform an instrument where there is no
prayer for such relief and no allegation of mistake or fraud, 17
O. S. 215. The petition must not only show that the mistake was
mutual, but that the party seeking the reformation would be*
prejudiced by a failure to reform, 24 Kas. 389. It must show
that the contract, as reduced to writing, does not contain what
both parties intended it should, point out the mistake, and aver
in terms what the tenor of the instrument or the true contract
ought to be, 3 Duer. 680 ; 6 Oreg. 193 ; 47 la. 173. An action may
be brought for the reformation of a contract, and for the recov
ery at the same time upon the contract when reformed, 31 O.
S. 628 ; see 21 Bull 141, 143 ; 46 O. S. 265
Rescission. The petition should allege a restoration of or offer
to restore the consideration, 52 How. Pr. 35; see 1 Clev. R. 90; 40
O. S. 190, unless the property is of no value, 24 O. S. 67, 345 ; and
in an action to rescind the sale of real property on the ground
of deceit by the vendor in misrepresenting the title, a tender of
a deed conveying the property back before the beginning of the
action has been held unnecessary, 19 Minn. 32; and in an ac
tion to set aside a contract for fraud, it is held unnecessary to
allege a tender back of the consideration, 46 How. Pr. 417. A
performance on the part of the plaintifff of conditions in the
contract need not be alleged in his action to rescind for failure
of defendant to perform, 16 O. S. 444, 453. In an action to set
aside a conveyance for false representations, it must be alleged
that the plaintifff relied on such representations, and was mis
led bv them, to his injury, 6 Oreg. 413. Where the ground of
the rescission is fraudulent statements that defendant was the
owner, the petition must set out the facts showing that he had
no title. It is not sufficient to allege merely that he is not the
lawful owner, 6 Neb. 134 ; nor to state that defendant never had
a good title, and that the title is defective, 7 Bush. 4.
Sales. In an action lor goods sold, a petition which avers
that the defendant is indebted to the plaintifff in a certain sum
for goods sold and delivered to him at nis request, and that the
defendant has not paid for the same, states a good cause of ac
tion, 7 N. Y. 476; 49 Cal. 141 ; 3 Kas. 372. It is unnecessary to
allege a promise to pay, 17 N. Y. 230, or that the demand has
not been paid, or that it remains due and unpaid at the time of
commencing the action, 10 Hun 242. In an action for damages)
for non-delivery, where payment and delivery are concurrent
8. 362. So where the delivery was to be at a particular
place, an averment of readiness and willingness to receive mmd
pay for the goods is required, 35 O. S. 104.
Services. Seduction. An averment in the petition that defend
ant was on a day named indebted to the plaintifff in a certain
Bum of money lor work and labor before that time performed
for him at his request, states a good cause of action, 4H Cal. 364;
see 33 O. 3. 336, 357 ; but where the contract is not completed, or
certain conditions remain to be performed, the plaintifff anoul4
set out the special agreement and allege a partial performance,
9 Abb. Fr. 353 ; 4 Inier. 295. In seduction it is sufficient toallege
as to loss of services that the wrongful act was to deprive plaint
iffof them, without alleging ability to perform the service", the
nature of them, or the actual loss, 32 O. S. 299, 312. It is not
necessary to aver deception, or to set forth the acts made use of
to deceive, 59 lud. 566; but it should be averred that plaintifff
knew the relationship, 6 Bush. 249; 12 Abb. Pr. n. ■ 187. Dama
ges for injury to plaintifff's feelings and sensibility may be re
covered under a genenil allegation of damage, and need not be
specially averred, 57 N. H. 59; but damages for prospective lots
ot service during minority must be declared on specially, 1 C
D. Smith, 453.
Specific performance. The petition must show a contract, in
cluding date, terms, and stipulations, 44 Tex. 390; that the
plaintifff offered to perform on his part, and that the defendant
refused, 9 Minn. 157 : but if it is averred that defendant expressly
repudiated the contract, and gave notice of his refusal to per
form, a tender of performance need not be averred, 13 O. S. 306.
It is enough to aver a readiness and willingness to perform, 45
N. Y. Superior Ct. 157. Reformation aud performance may both
be asked for and obtained in the same action, 42 O. S. 449 ; 16 O.
490 ; and the prayer may be for specific performance or rescission
in the alternative, 42 O. S. 449; out a petition is bad which seeks
both specific performance and rescission, though, If no objection
is made and damages awarded, it will be regarded as seeking
damages alone, 16 O. S. lis, 129 : generally \\ 5797-5802.
Stockfio&er's liability. A stockholder or creditor may enforce
such liability 'by action, jointly, against all the holders or owners
of stock, for the benefit of all the creditors of the corporation,
and against all persons liable as stockholders, § 3260. The peti
tion should aver that defendant was a stockholder at the date
the debt was incurred, 2C. S. C. R. 350; that plaintifff recovered a
judgment against the company on which execution was issued,
and returned no goods or chattels, lands and tenements whereon
to levy, aud that the company has no property subject to execu
tion from which judgment can be made, and said judgment
remains in full force, unpaid and unsatisfied, Bates PL 739. As
the stockholders are liable in double the amount of stock
owned by them, Const., Art. xiii. §3; §3258, that fact should
be averred ; and if the names of stockholders are unknown, the
petition should contain a prayer for a discovery of their names
and amounts due from each, see 7 N. Y. 147 ; 11 O. 273, 292. In an
action by creditors to enforce statutory liability, where it la
alleged that the company is insolvent, entirely ceased to do
business, made an assignment, etc., it is not necessary further
to allege that plaintifff had recovered a judgment on which an
execution had been returned unsatisfied, 46 O. S.l.
Subscription. In an action to collect a stock subscription, the
petition should show that the corporation is authorized to have
a capital stock and take subscriptions to the same, 24 Minn. 327,
and aver a tender of the stock to the defendant, 23 Minn. 439;
but where the subscriptions are to be paid in installments, an
averment of readiness to deliver the certificates is sufficient, 2 D.
261 ; and if the action is brought by an assignee making the
original company and the subscribers parties, the want of such
averment will not render the petition fatally defective, Id. In
case of a subscription with a condition attached, it is not neces
sary to aver that the subscriber was notified of the acceptance of
his subscription, it being sufficient if the petition avers that he
had notice of the performance of the condition, 15 O. S. 328 ; but
where the contract contains a condition that a certain amount
of stock shall be subscribed for as a condition precedent, the
plaintifff must allege that the requisite amount of stock has been
subscribed, or facts necessary to showa waiverof such condition,
2 Met. (Ky.) 314; 5 Neb. 70; 3 Kas. 55, unless the action is upon
an unconditional promise to pay, 13 Bush. 32. In an action on a
railroad subscription contract conditioned to be paid in install
ments as might, from time to time, be called ior by the directors,
provided that the same should be expended upon a certain line
of road, to be thereafter designated by the company, it was held
that the petition showing neither the construction of the road
along the line designated nor an offer nor readiness to expend
the money subscribed according to the condition was defective,
and that upon demurrer by plaintifff to an answer to such peti
tion, such defects in the petition required the petition to be
overruled, 10 O. S. 241. Under § 3243, providing for the creation
and regulation of incorporated companies in this state, where a
railroad company sues to recover unpaid installments of stock,
an allegation in the petition that its board of directors required
subscriptions to its stock to be paid in installments of a certain
amount is material to its right of recovery, 26 O. S. 310 ; and
where installments are payable on requisition of directors, and
on publication of notice, the facts of requisition and publication
must be set forth with convenient certainty of time and place,
9 O. 136.
Sureties. See I 5845 et seq. In an action for contribution, the
petition should aver the obligation of the parties as sure
ties, the payment of the debt by plaintifff, that plaintifff noti
fied defendant of such payment, demanded contribution from
him, and that no part of theamount has been paid, 4 Dev. (N. C.)
360, 363 ; see 5 O. 444 ; 9 O. 106 ; 16 O. S. 552.
Trespass. The petition should aver possession, 38 Barb. 9, or
ownership, 7 Kas. 35, and possession would sufficiently appear
from an allegation of title, 38 Barb. 9 ; 8 O. 40, 42. It is not neces
sary to allege, in trespass on laud, that the injury was forcible,
14 Cal. 81 ; 28 Conn. 493, or the act was wrongful, unlawful or
without license, 64 Ind. 98. A petition in trespass for cutting
down and carrying away the plaintifff's trees is good without an
averment that the land where the trees were belonged to the
plaintifff, W. 500. In an action against a railroad company for
trespass in laying its tracks in the public street, between the
center thereof and the plaintifff's lots, it is sufficient for the
plaintifff to allege his ownership of the lots and the commission
of the trespass thereon, 21 Minn. 362. The plaintifff's ownership in the street will be implied Irom nn averment of his owner
ship of the adjacent lots, Id. Special damages must be averred
to be recovered, as loss of rents, custom, etc., 21 Minn. 364.
Trust. In au action to have a trust declared, all the facts
through which the trust is claimed should be set out, 23 Me. 182.
When plaintifffseeks to have an implied trust in lands declared on
the ground that he contributed to the purchase money, he must
aver and prove that he furnished a definitely ascertainable ali
quot part of the purchase money, 17 O. S. 510. A bill to estab
lish a trust in property supposed to have been purchased with
trust funds must allege that fact, 33 Ala. 497. If it is sought to
enforce the execution of a trust in the name of a mere volun
teer, and for his benefit, a declaration of trust in his favor must
be alleged, 19 Ala. 259. A cestui que trust who seeks to establish
a stale trust, shou d set forth specifically what were the impedi
ments to an earlier prosecution of his claim, how he came
to be so long ignorant of his rights, the means used by the re
spondent to fraudulently conceal the facts from him, and when
he first had knowledge of his rights, 2 Wall. 87. Parties claim
ing under or against a will can not maintain an action for the
mere purpose of obtaining the court's opinion as to its legal
meaning, when no trust is involved and no advice to an execu
tor or other trustee is requested, 29 O. S. 147.
Warranty. In an action on a warranty a valid sale must be
averred as a consideration of the promise of warranty, and it is
sufficient to aver that the sale was for a certain price, without
specifying it, for this shows a consideration, 12 O. 24; but if the
pleader attempts to set out and describe particularly the con
sideration and introduces a written contract of sale, containing
a different consideration, it must be rejected upon the ground oi
variance between the statement in the pleading and the proof,
Id. In averring a breach, it is sufficient to negative the words
of warranty without stating the particulars, 27 Vt. 720. In an
action on a warranty that an article was fit for a designed pur
pose, the purpose for which the article was warranted fit must
be stated, 3 M. & G. 868.
Will. Under § 6202, an executor, administrator, guardian, or
other trustee, may maintain an action in the common pleas
against creditors, etc., asking the direction or judgment of the
court in any matter respecting the trust, estate, or property to
be administered, or, in case they refuse on request in writing,
a creditor, legatee, etc., may bring such action ; but when no
trust is involved and no advice to an executor or other trustee
is requested, parties claiming under or against a will can not
maintain an action for the mere purpose of obtaining the court's
opinion as to its legal meaning or effect, 29 O. S. 147. A petition
filed uuder this section by an executor, stating that doubts are
entertained by himself and others as to the validity of a certain
provision in the testator's will requiring him to erect a monu
ment, and that he desires the direction and judgment of the
court whether the provision is valid, but not alleging that there
is now in his hands, or will come under his control, any money
or property which might be applied in defraying such expense,
does not state facts sufficient to require such direction or judg
ment of the court, 35 O. S. 503. In an action to obtain the con
struction of a will, the petition should state that the testator left
property, and also whether real or personal or both, 43 Barb. 404,
410. In an action to contest the validity of a will, the petition
must allege the death of testator, and must show the plaintifff to
have some interest of some kind in the subject matter involved
in the contest, 64 Ind. 53. A testator's mental unsoundness is
sufficiently averred by an allegation that at the time of signing
the supposed will he was not ot sound and disposing mind ; but,
on the contrary, he was at such time of unsound mind, S. C.
Cal. 3 West. C. Rep. 377. It is not necessary to name the persons
exercising undue influence, as they may be unknown to plaint
iff, Myrick's Prob. Cal. 259; see I 5858 et seq.
§ 5061. Each cause of action to be separately stated,
etc. When the petition contains more than one cause of
action, they shall be separately stated and numbered.
[51 v. 57, §86; S. & C. 973.]
The irregularity is reached by motion and not by demurrer.
10 O. S. 441 ; 29 O. S. 138; otherwise it is waived, S O. S. 423; 39
O. S. 1:13; 2 C. S. C. R. 14, 21 ; and the refusal of a motion to
compel plaintifff to separately state his causes of action is not
ground of error unless the opposite party is prejudiced, 36 O. S.
43. It is a general rule, however, that facts constituting a single
cause of action can not be subdivided into two or more causes
of action, 16 O. S. 88; 8 O. S. 215; 24 Fed. Rep. 580; and where
there is one cause of action, and it is set forth in several counts,
plaintifff may be compelled by motion to elect on which one
he will rely, 10 How. Pr. 281; 8 O. S. 215 16O.S.281; but where
he is uncertain as to the grounds of his recovery, or there is a
fair and reasonable doubt as to his ability safely to plead them
in one form, he may set forth his causes of action in distinct
statements, and will not be compelled to elect as between them,
65 How. Pr. 1; 61 Cal. 209; 12 Abb. n. c. 309 ; 31 Hun 432; as
where plaintifff seeks to recover upon two grounds, both of
which may be true, and he does not know which one, he may
state them as separate causes of action, and in the alternative in
one petition, 9 Bull 355; 16 Bull 3'.,9 (but see 1C.C.R. 203, 207);
and since our statute does not require that the facts shall be
stated without unnecessary repetition, this mode of pleading
can not be regarded objectionable, 9 Bull 355. *' There may be
actually two grounds, or, being only one, certain supposed
grounds may be so connected that the plaintifff will not be able
to tell in advance which will be established upon the trial. The
code will have failed in its chief object if he is forbidden
to develop every ground upon which he bases his right to
recover," Bliss Code PI. \ 120; see Pomeroy Rem. § 576; 27 Wis.
327: 1 Abb. Pr. 442. In an action against a railroad company
for killing a horse, counting on neglect to keep feuces in repair
and negligence in running its trains, the court overruled a
motion to compel plaintifff to elect, saying that the addition of
a tort to a separate and distinct act in violation of a contract did
not deprive the injured party of the right to complain at the
same time of both wrongs, 41 O. S. 233. The following are in
stances of single causes of action : Statutory damages and costs of
protest on a bill of exchange, 1 H. 575 ; duinages for fraud in the
sale of diseased sheep, and for affecting other sheep of plaintifff,
and injuring his pasture, 21 O. S. 655. Loss to plaintifff of his
wife's services and the expenditure by him of means and labor in healing and curing for himself and children, such damage*
being the result of the same negligent act, constitute hut a Mnicle
cause of action, 57 Ind. 297. Items 'on a running accountlor
merchandise sold constitute hut a single cause of action, and a
recovery in one is a bar to a subsequent action for the residue,
13 Wend. 646. A change of the grade of a street and change of
the sidewalk to correspond are parts of the same thing, and an
abutter, by bringing suit for the recovery of damages for the
one, splits up his cause of action and b.trs himself from the
right to sue for the other, 63 la. 36. Different acts of fraud in
obtaining money and different fraudulent claims at different
times in pursuance of an alleged conspiracy, may be treated as
a single cause of action, 5 Hun 353; 63 N. Y. 194. A petition
which avers for one cause of action a mortgage given to secure
a usurious loan and demands its cancellation, and, for another,
aveis that defendantwrongfully took and detained chattels speci
fied in the mortgage sets forth but a single cause of action, viz.:
taking and converting chattels, 32 Hun 194. An entire conver
sation in which slanderous words were used may constitute a
single cause of action, 16 la. 301. Services, a part of which were
rendered to a firm of which defendant was surviving partner,
and the other part, under the same contract, to defendant alone,
may be sued on as a single cause of action, 53 Wis. 188. As
instances of separate causes of action, may be mentioned: An
injury to a cab and an injury to the cab-driver by the same col
lision, 14 Law Rep. Q. B.141 ; distinct contracts of sale, 15 Pick.
409 ; 28 Minn. 418; damages by overflow to property assigned to
plaintifff, and damages by overflow after he became the owner.
1 D. 58; a claim for damages for alleged wrongful dismissal
from employment and a claim for wages earned during the same
time plaintifff was actually employed, due and payable before
the wrongful dismissal, 85 N. Y. 345.
SUBDIVISION in. DEMURRER.
§ 5062. When defendant may demur to petition. The
defendant may demur to the petition only when it ap
pears on its face either:
1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the person of
the defendant, or the subject of the action.
2. That the plaintifff has not legal capacity to sue.
3. That there is another action pending between the
same parties, for the same cause.
4. That there is a misjoinder of parties plaintifff.
5. That there is a defect of parties, plaintifff or de
fendant.
6. That several causes of action are improperly joined.
7. That separate causes of action against several de
fendants are improperly joined.
8. That the petition does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. [01 v. 57, \ 87 ; 8. & C. 973.]
General remarks. A demurrer is a pleading under the code, 5
How. Pr. 206. It admits the truth of the allegations demurred to, 25 O. S. S49, so far as is necessary to determine the question
raised, 5 O. 109 ; but it only admits what is well pleaded, 13 O. S.
228 ; 25 O. S. 443 : 32 O. S. 44; 80 O. S. 37. It admits the truth of
facts that are relevant and well pleaded so far as is necessary
to determine the question raised, 25 O. S. 349 ; 68 N. Y. 294. It
does not admit statements of legal conclusions, 30 O. S. 41 ; 29 O.
S. 341 ; 33 O. S. 384 ; nor the truth of conjectures, 26 O. S. 452, nor
averments as to the meaning or contents of a paper set forth in
a pleading or made part thereof, 68 N. Y. 294, nor inferences
from facts which do not support them, 33 O. S. 381; 32 O. S. 374.
A demurrer searches the whole record, and judgment will be
given against the first party whose pleading is defective, 10 O. S.
241; Bliss Code PI. § 417a; 26 O. S. 652. A general demurrer to a
petition containing several causes of action will be overruled if
any one of the causes of action is sufficiently stated, 26 O. S. 310 ;
16 O. S. 455 ; and a general demurrer to an answer must be over
ruled if any part of the answer states a good defense, 1 Clev. R.
219; and a general demurrer to each of tho several paragraphs
of an answer will be overruled where, as a whole, they state a
good defense, 30 O. S. 308. A joint demurrer by several defend
ants will be overruled if a good cause of action is stated as
against any of them, 9 Neb. 515; 11 Neb. 192. The objections to
which a demurrer lies must appear upon the face of the peti
tion, otherwise they should be taken by answer, 10 Abb. N. C
85. One can not demur and answer at the same time to the same
defense ; he must elect to do the one or the other, 6 O. S. 573 ; 10
O. 137. It is not good practice to demur and move to have a
pleading made more definite and certain at the same time, 2 D.
499; and it is irregular to Hie two demurrers to the same pteading,
38 Wis. 394 ; but where two demurrers were filed to a petition,
one for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and the other for misjoinder of causes of action, and no
objection was taken, it was held that they should be treated as
one demurrer on two grounds, Id. A demurrer does not lie for an
omission to attach a cony of an instrument to a pleading, 12 O.
S. 60 ; 10 Neb. 527, to a bill of particulars before a justice of the
peace, 1 C. C. R. 85, where facts are stated as matters of belief
only. 13 O. S. 228, for indefiniteness or uncertainty in pleading,
8 O. S. 293 ; 14 O. S. 200. It does not lie to a process, 3 W. L. M.
195, to a part of a single cause of action, 2 C. S. C. R. 14, for
misnomer, 17 O. 607, because the pleading is not separately
stated or numbered, 10 O. S. 441. It does not lie to a petition in
error, 2 W. L. M. 465, to a prayer for relief, 11 Neb. 192, to mat
ters of form, 20 O. 1J0, to a denial, 26 O. S. 310; 10 O. S. 451, and
semble to the caption of a pleading, 22 Kas. 725, 729, because a
plea or answer is not sworn to, 87 Ind. 208. Argumentative
ness is not ground of demurrer, 100 Ind. 85. The remedy in all
such cases is by motion, and it is only when the pleading is in
curable by amendment that demurrer lies, see 2 Bates PI. 962.
A demurrer to evidence is not sanctioned by the code. The
better practice is to move to exclude the evidence or instruct
the jury that it is insufficient, Welch's Index Dig.; 34 O. S. 294.
A failure to demur waices every objection except those to the
jurisdiction of the court, and that facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action are not stated, § 5004 ; 13 O. S. 72. A demurrer
is waived by filing an answer, 12 O. S. 60 ; 7 Neb. 237. Filing an
answer with a demurrer to the same defense waives the demurrer, 30 la. 221. Filing a demurrer to an amended pleading
waives a demurrer to the original pleading, 44 la. 512. Filing a
demurrer waives a motion, 1 Clev. R. 178. By answering over to
the merits defendant waives any error based upon a ruling on
the demurrer, 33 O. S. 555; but see 19 Bull 270: and where the
court below sustains a demurrer and the plaintifff afterwards
files a new amended petition be waives any error that may
have been committed in sustaining the demurrer to the first
pleading, 16 O. S. 1. A demurrer is waived by submitting to an
appeal, 13 O. S. 72, 75; and error in sustaining a demurrer is
waived by setting up the same matter in the answer or reply, 17
O. S. 330 ; 23 O. S. 1. When a demurrer is abandoned or tcithdrawn
it is no longer a part of the record, 14 O. 204 ; 74 N. Y. 495.
Taking leave to reply is equivalent to withdrawing a demurrer,
10 O. 405; but if defendant's demurrer be overruled with per
mission to withdraw it upon terms, and he goes to trial without
complying with the terms, the demurrer will form a part of the
record, and is an admission of the facts stated in the pleadings
to which it is interposed, Boone Code PI. § 40; 22 N. Y. 472.
Where a demurrer to au answer is good as to one defense and
bad as to another, it should be sustained in part and overruled
in part, 35 Hun 410. Final judgment may be rendered on de
murrer, 22 O. S. 159 ; 24 O. S. 445; and leave to amend need not
be granted unless a«ked for, 22 O. S. 159 ; and judgment by de
fault may be rendered after sustaining a demurrer to au answer,
3 Bull 894 ; 6 Id. 217; but judgment on demurrer is improper
in a will contest, 14 O. S. 157. If the court is equalty divided a
demurrer must be overruled, 12 O. 21.
That the court has no jurisdiction, etc. A demurrer for want of
jurisdiction of the person will rarely lie for the reason that the
pleadings do not snow the residence of the parties, Bliss Code
PI. % 405. An objection for want of jurisdiction may be taken by
demurrer where it appears upon the face of the pleadings, 67
How. It. 191, otherwise it must be by answer, 14 Hun 8"J; 15
How. Pr. 500. It is not, however, waived if not taken by de
murrer or answer, § 5064; 4 Abb. n. c. 111. It may be raised at
any stage of the proceedings. It may be raised on appeal, 36
Barb. 38. "The meaning of the clause that the court has no
jurisdiction, etc., is that the person is not subject to the juris
diction of the court, and not that the suit has not been regu
larly commenced. If the suit has not been regularly com
menced, the defendant must relieve himself from such irregu
larity by motion," 8 Barb. 541 ; s. c. 5 How. Pr. 96. A demurrer
only looks to the pleading, and not to the process, 58 Ga. 199.
If a demurrer be interposed to a petition containing several
causes of action properly united, but of one of which the court
has no jurisdiction, it will be overruled if it is to the whole
petition, and assigns no cause of demurrer except the improper
union of several causes of action, 3 Duer. 643. The demurrer in
such case should be limited to the cause of action of which the
court has no jurisdiction, Boone Code PI. § 47.
That plaintifff has not tegal capacity to sue. The objection that
plaintifff has not legal capacity to sue, when it appears on the
face of the petition, should be taken by demurrer, 13 O. S. 210.
Unless taken by demurrer or answer, it is waived, 14 O. S. 448;
36 O. S. 68. It lies where a partnership does not show a right to
sue under § 5011, 13 O. S. 210 ; where it appears upon the face of the pleadings that plaintifff suing as a corporation is not such,
40 Barb. 571; 37 N.Y. 648; where some legal disability of the
plaintifff, such as infancy, idiocy, or coverture, is disclosed, 31
Ind. 355 ; 11 Kas. 128 ; 16 Neb. 483. It is held that it can only be
sustained on these grounds, 67 Ind. 570. Mr. Bliss says that this
is too narrow a view to take of the statute, and that incapacity to
sue may arise from want of title to the character in which
plaintifff sues, Bliss Code PI. § 408, citing Moak's Van Stan Voord
[*668] ; as when an executor does not appear to have proved
the will of his testator, or appears to have proved it in an im
proper or insufficient court, as he does not show a complete title
to sue as executor, a demurrer will lie, Bliss Code PI. j* 408 ; Mitford's Eq. PI. [*155] ; and when an action is brought by a foreign
executor or administrator, without showing authority from the
state in which the proceeding is had, a demurrer will lie for
want of capacity to sue, 26 How. Pr. 15 ; and where an invalid
appointment of a receiver has been made, demurrer should lie
for incapacity to sue, 3 Abb. Pr. 119. In a writ of quo warranto
upon the relation of certain persons, a general demurrer will
not raise the question as to the right of the relators to sue, but
their want of capacity should be specifically made the ground
of demurrer, 53 N. Y. 648. Where plaintifff, though having an
interest in the subject of the suit and relief demanded, does
not show a right to appear in court and demand relief in his
own name, see 77 Mo. 105.
That there is another action pending, etc. This objection must
appear upon the face of the petition to admit of demurrer,
7Robt. 194; 42 Ind. 632; otherwise it must be taken by answer,
5 How. Pr. 51. It is sufficient if the other action pleaded was
pending at the commencement of the suit, 21 Ind. 98. The
character of the prior action is not material if full relief could
have beengiven therein, 16 Barb. 461; but if it was for relief, which
could not be granted in the action demurred to, the demurrer
will not be sustained, 5 N. Y. 357; nor if the prior action is pend
ing in the United States court or the court of a sister state, 5
Sand. 530 ; 31 Barb. 364 ; 5 How. Pr. 51. It must appear that both
actions are for the same cause of action, 16 Abb. Pr. 98, and that
the party demurring was a party to the former suit, 11 Hun 428,
though it is not essential that he commenced it, 6 How. Pr. 279 ;
16 Barb. 401 ; contra, 41 Cal. 61.
Misjoinder of parties plaintifff. By misjoinder is meant excess
of parties, Bates PI. 67 ; 31 O. S. 15, 20. Misjoinder of parties de
fendant is not ground of demurrer, 32 O. S. 299 ; 31 O. S. 15; 12
O. S. 273. The objection must be taken by demurrer when it
appears upon the face of the petition, 29 Cal. 637. It can not be
raised by demurrer that the petition does not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a cause of action, 51 Cal. 511. It may be
pleaded in the answer, 49 Cal. 155. It must be specific, 33 Hun
419 ; 7 Colo. 477. The objection must be raised in the court be
low, 31 Ark. 480. The misjoinder musthave existed as aground
of demurrer when the issue was made, 22 Hun 150, 157. Where
plaintifff brings suit in his individual right, and also in his rep
resentative capacity, a demurrer on this ground will be sus
tained, 69 Cal. 293. Where there is a misjoinder of parties, it
matters not that the petition makes a good cause of action
against some oi the parties, or against each separately, 16 O. S.
1, 8. " Where a joint right was averred in several plaintifffs, but the facts showed a several right in one, this is not a cam; of mis
joinder of plaintifffs, hut a case of failure of proof in not show
ing the joint cause of action alleged ; and if apparent on the
face of the petition, demurrer lay, or the objection could bo
raised by answer, and is not waived by failure to object," Bates
in. 68, citing 13 O. S. 72 ; 17 O. S. 323 ; Id. 183. " Where two causes
of action upon contract are joined in the same action, a demur
rer to the complaint upon the ground that all the defendant*
are not affected by both causes of action lies at the instance of
the defendant so affected. The objection is not to misjoinder
of parties, but of causes of action, and the rule that defendant
against whom a good cause of action is pleaded must demur
because too many are joined does not apply. ' ' Bliss Code Pl. citing
94 N. Y. 22.
That several causes of action are improperly joined. The objec
tion may be taken by answer, § 5064; 1 H. 32; 2W.L.M. 497. If
not taken by demurrer or answer, it is waived, 1 H. 32; see 10
O. S. 437; Id. 438. The demurrer must be specific, otherwise the
question of misjoinder will not be regarded, 51 Cal. 431. It will
ne only when a union of the causes of action is forbidden, 38
S. Y. 21 ; where there is a union of causes of action, to one of
which is an additional though unnecessary party, 94 N. Y. 22,
and though the causes of action improperly united are not sep
arately stated, 60 N. Y. 427, the omission to state them in
separate counts does not deprive defendant of the right to de
mur. Id. ; 64 N. Y. 173. A demurrer for misjoinder of actions can
not be defeated by claiming that the pleading fails to state moro
than one cause ofaction, 63 How. Pr. 354. It does not lie on this
ground when causes of action which may have been united in
one pleading, had they been separately stated, have been Im
properly mingled in one count, 64 N. Y. 173; the remedy is by
motion, Id.; 29 O. S. 144; 6 Kas. 547; nor where the petition
contains a single cause of action, though stated in different
counts as separate causes of action, 30 O. S. 308 ; 13 Kas. 351 ; nor
where the petition states a single cause of action, but asks sev
eral distinct forms of relief, all properly obtainable under the
facts stated, 41 N. Y. 107.
Defect of parties. A defect is a deficiency and not excess of
parties, 7 Abb. Pr. 41 ; 17 N. Y. 592; 12 How. Pr. 134. Demurrer
will lie on this ground only where it appears from the face of the
petition that there is a defect, 31 O. S. 15. Where the defect does
not appear on the face of the petition, objection may be taken
by answer, § 5064. The objection is waived if not taken by
demurrer or answer, 14 O. S. 448 ; 27 How. Pr. 336. The demurrer
must specify the particular defect objected to, and it is not suffi
cient if it follows the words of the statute merely, 13 Abb. 442 ;
91 Ind. 182. A demurrer that plaintifff does not state facts suffi
cient to constitute a cause of action does not raise the question
of defect of parties, 48 Cal. 514. The party demurring must ap
pear to have au interest in having the omitted parties joined to
sustain a demurrer on this ground, 28 Barb. 602 ; 14 Abb. Pr. 80,
or to be prejudiced by the non-joinder, 30 How. Pr. 271. But a
demurrer for non-joinder is not well taken if the court can
determine the controversy without prejudice to the rights of
others, or by saving their rights, 5 How. Pr. 99 ; but if it appear
that the presence of other persons is necessary, and the court
can not determine the controversy without them, the demurrer will be sustained, 7 Colo. 296. A demurrer on this ground has
been held proper in an action against one of two obligors upon
a joint obligation, 33 How. Pr. 80; in an action for trespass upon
land held in common, where it appeared by the petition that
plaintifffs were onlypartof the owners but it did notappear that
the others were joined. 37 N. Y. 372; where a contract was made
with two persons join tly, and one of them sued on it as a several
contract, 50 Cal. 222; where a plaintifff brought an action to re
cover damages for the conversion of a chattel, and it appeared
upon the face of the petition that he claimed to be owner of a
third interest therein, 24 Hun 448. It was formerly the rule that
a demurrer for defect of parties would not lie unless it affirma
tively appeared by the pleading that the person who should have
been made a party was living at the time the action was com
menced, 11 How. Pr. 569 ; 23 How. Pr. 97; but this rule is abro
gated, and a demurrer will lie now unless it appears on the
face of the petition that the omitted parties are dead, 33 How.
Pr. 80 ; 53 How. Pr. 33.
Tlvat the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. The objection on this ground ia not waived by failure
to demur or answer, § 5064. It may be taken at any stage of
the case, 32 N. Y. 397, before final judgment in error; but if such
objection has not been made prior to filing the petition iu
error, it should in some form appear in the record of the review
ing court before the case is heard, 30 O S. 133. It may be stated
in the language of the statute, 30 Cal. 666; but in demurring on
account of the statute of limitations the better practice is to
state the ground specifically 29 O. S. 245, 250. It lies where the
petition omits a material fact necessary to the plaintifff's cause
of action, 14 Abb. Pr. 282; where the action is prematurely
brought, 21 Ark. 186; 11 Cal. 114; contra, 5 Hun 28; 19 N. Y. 271;
where the facts stated do not entitle the plaintifff to the relief
demanded, though they would have entitled him to some other
relief had he demanded it, 29 Hun 422; where the petition fails
to show any connection between the facts alleged and the party
interposing the demurrer, 3 E. D. Smith 677; where a petition by
several, jointly, fails to show a joint cause of action, 94 lud. 64;
13 O. S. 72; 17 O. S. 183; where it appears on the face of the
pleading that the cause of action is barred by the statute of limi
tations, 8 O. S. 215; 29 O. S. 245. It does not lie for a defective
statement of facts, 14 O. S. 200; 30 O. S. 30S ; nor where the peti
tion contains several causes of action only one of which is good,
26 O. S. 310; see 16 O. S. 1 ; Id. 455. It does not reach the question
of the jurisdiction of the court. 94 Ind. 216; nor of defect of
parties. 38 Cal. 514; nor of capacity of plaintifff to sue, 10 Abb.
n. c. 85; nor of misjoinder of parties. 12 How. Pr. 547. It does
not lie to the prayer for relief, 56 How. Pr. 452; nor the date in
the verification, 5 Hun 114; nor, it seems, to the caption of the
petition, 22 Kas. 729. It can not be sustained where the petition
entitles the plaintifff to some relief, though not the relief prayed
for, 60 How. Pr. 511 ; but see 29 Hun 422.
§ 5063. Demurrer must be specific. The demurrer
shall specify the grounds of objection to the petition »
and unless it does so, it shall be regarded as objecting
only that the petition does not state facts sufficient toH 5064-5067
constitute a cause of action, or that the court has not
jurisdiction of the subject matter. [51 v. 57, \ 88 ; S. &
C. 975.]
The better practice in demurring on account of the statute of
limitations is to state the ground specifically, 29 O. S. 245, 250:
44 O. S. 12.
§ 5064. When objection may be taken by answer.
When waived. When any of the defects enumerated in
§ 5062 do not appear upon the face of the petition, the
objection may be taken by answer (1); and if no objec
tion be taken either by demurrer or answer, the defend
ant shall be deemed to have waived the same (2), except
only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court (3),
and that the petition does not state facte sufficient to
constitute a cause of action (4). [51 v. 57, § 89 ; S. & C.
975.]
See I 5062. 1. Where it appears in the petition in an action
brought by two plaintifffs that the cause of action is not joint but
several, the right to set up such defense by answer is not waived
by failure to demur, 17 O. S. 323. 2. Objection to the legal
capacity of a married woman to sue alone, and to defect of par
ties, is waived by failure to answer or demur, 14 O. S. 448. 3. 18
O. S. 521. 4. This objection may be taken advantage of at any
time before final j udgineut in error, 30 O. S. 133.
§ 5065. Misjoinder. When several petitions may be filed.
When a demurrer is sustained on the ground of misjoinder
of several causes of action in a petition or answer, the
court, on motion of the party who filed the pleading, shall
allow him, with or without costs, in its discretion, to file
several petitions, each including such of the causes of
action as might have been joined ; and an action shall
be docketed for each of the petitions, and the same shall
be proceeded in without further service. [51 v. 57, \ 90;
S.&C. 975.]
14 Kas. 130. This section applies as well where the objection
to the misjoinder of causes of action is made by answer as by
demurrer, 1 H. 32.
§ 6066. Demurrer to part and answer to part. The
defendant may demur to one or more of the several
causes of action stated in the petition, and answer as to
the residue. [51 v. 57, § 91 ; S. & C. 975.]
But a party can not demur and answer to the same cause of
action, or reply and dem ur to the same defense, at the same time,
6 O. S. 473 ; 9 O. 136 ; 10 O. 137.
§ 5067. Demurrer to reply. The defendant may also demur to the reply, or to a separate traverse or avoid
ance contained in the reply, of a defense or counter
claim, on the ground that it is insufficient in law, upon
its face.
Demurrer lies to a reply when it does not support the peti
tion. Where there is a departure, 1 C. S. C. R. 12. Failure to
demur to a reply that does not contain new matter sufficient to
avoid a defense does not waive the right to object to the suffi
ciency of the reply, 31 O. S. 492. Error in sustaining a demurrer
to a reply setting up new matter sufficient to avoid a defense is
ground for a reversal of judgment, unless the record shows such
error to have been otherwise waived, 18 O. S. 353; but a judg
ment will not be reversed for error in sustaining a demurrer to
a reply when plaintifff on leave files an amended reply, present
ing the same issues in addition to others, and the case proceeds
to trial and final judgment upon the issues thus presented,
23 O. S. 1.
§ 5068. Plaintiff may demur to answer. The plaintifff
may demur to a counterclaim, set-off, or defense con
sisting of new matter contained in the answer, on the
ground that it is insufficient in law, on its face.
An objection to the sufficiency of the answer should be taken
by demurrer when it relates to matters of substance, 10 O. S. 501 ;
but where the insufficiency consists in indeflniteness and un"
certainty of statement the remedy is by motion, 20 Kas. 462; 3o
O. S. 308, where the meaning can not be mistaken, 87 Ind. 34.
A demurrer will not lie because of argumentativeness or surplusage, 13 Abb. Pr. 334; nor for irrelevant matter merely, 1
Duer. 242; nor because the allegations of the answer are hypo
thetical, 9 Bosw. 679 ; nor for want of verity in the allegations of
the answer, 21 la. 441; nor because it contains inconsistent
statements, 10 Kas. 298; nor where the facts are stated in the
pleading as matter of belief, 13 O. S. 228; and where, in an
answer seeking equitable relief, the defendant sets up a partial
but not complete bar it is not demurrable, 18 O. S. 490. A de
fense inartificially drawn, which commingles denials and new
matter, can not for that reason be held bad on demurrer if by
liberal construction its allegations state a defense, 10 Abb. Pr.
3(i2; and where the facts, if well stated, would constitute a de
fense a general demurrer for want of facts sufficient to state a
valid defense will not be sustained, 30 O. S. 308; and where the
answer as a whole shows a valid defense a general demurrer to
each of the numbered paragraphs in the answer is not well
taken, 29 O. S. 311 ; nor where the answer contains several dis
tinct grounds of defense and one of them is sufficient to bar the
action, 10 O. S. 455 ; nor where different grounds of defense are
improperly intermingled in one statement, 25 Wis. 703. The
remedy is by motion, Id. A general demurrer to an answer
which contains new matter and a specific denial of certain alle
gations in the petition should be overruled if the allegations
denied are material to the plaintifff's right of action, 26 O. S. 310.
A demurrer searches the whote record, and judgment will be given
\229. A demurrer to the reply reaches the cross-petition, 26 O.
S. 652. The defendant may, on argument of demurrer, attack
the petition on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction,
or that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, and if it appears that the objections thus raised
are well taken, the defendant will be entitled to judgment not
withstanding the defects in the answer, 32 N. Y. 397 ; 2 Abb. Pr.
365 ; 32 Hun 446; but the rule that the demurrer reaches the
first defective pleading is subject to the qualification, that it is
only an objection to the jurisdiction, or that the petition does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a causa of action that
searches the record upon a demurrer to the answer, 7 Minn.
502 ; 25 Wis. 514. The demurrer must lie to t)ie whole of the answer
or a particular and separate defense. It can not be directed to a
part of an entire defense or certain lines thereof, 4 How. Pr. 413.
On demurrer to an entire, defense, it is error to sustain it as to
part and to strike out the remainder, 9 Minn. 356; but when the
answer sets up several distinct defenses on demurrer part may
be held good and the others bad, VI la. 191. If a paragraph of
an answer is addressed and limited to a part only of the peti
tion, and as to that portion states a good defense, there is no
error in overruling a demurrer to such partial answer, 92 Ind.
225. In an action ou two promissory notes, an answer purport
ing to bar the action which only alleges matter in defense is in
sufficient on demurrer, 86 Ind. 260. A general demurrer to an
answer which contains new matter and a specific denial of cer
tain allegations in the petition should be overruled if the alle
gations denied are material, 26 O. S. 310. A demurrer admits only
such allegations as are well pleaded, 32 O. S. 46: it does not
admit conclusions of law, 33 O. S. 384, nor allegations which it
appears upon the pleadings that the pleader is estopped to
make, 47 la. 129, nor those which are impertinent and imma
terial, 86 Ind. 323; nor matters of which the court takes notice,
as the enactment of public statutes. H Wis. 14; and where the
allegations of the answer are contradictory it only admits those
which the law adjudges to be true, 10 Abb. Pr. b70. ,4 demurrer
liesto a counterclaim where the causeof action stated as aeounterclaimissuch that an action upon it can not be nniinuiincd by
the defendant alone against the plaintifff alone, 25 Minn. 155. If
the counterclaim contain irrevelant or redundant matter, the
remedy is by motion, and not demurrer, 24 How. Pr. 329. Where
a demurrer was interposed to a counterclaim as set up in one
paragraph of the answer, it was held that defendant did not
waive his exception to the ruling on the demurrer by afterwards
filing an amendment to another paragraph of his answer, in
which amendment there was no reference to the counterclaim.
62 la. 477. On overruling a demurrer to a counterclaim, no
judgment should be entered until all the issues are disposed of,
9 Hun 633. Judgment will not be reversed for error in sustaining
a demurrer to the answer where all the averments in it were
contained in an amended answer on which issue was taken, 17
O. S. 336; and judgment will not be reversed for error in refusing
leave to reply after demurrer to the answer is overruled. It is a
final submission unless leave is obtained to reply or amend, 24
O. S. 445 ; and where a demurrer is sustained to a paragraph of
the answer, and it appears that all the material facts alleged
therein could have been given in defense under another para
\graph of the answer which remains in the record, the error, in
sustaining such demurrer, if it be an error, is harmless, and
will not authorize a reversal of the judgment, 90 Ind. 264. A de
murrer is waived by voluntarily replying to a paragraph of the
answer while the demurrer is pending, 92 Ind. 247 ; but when
the answer is held bad on demurrer, the defendant does not
waive his exceptions to rulings on the demurrer by amending
his answer so as to set up a new defense, but such waiver follows
only where the amendment is designed to supply an omission
or cure a defect pointed out by the demurrer, 60 la. 16. Error in
sustaining a demurrer is waived by setting up the same matter
in the answer or reply, 17 O. S. 330 ; 23 O. S. 1.
ji 5069 Demurrer to counterclaim, etc., when defend
ant demands affirmative relief. The plaintifff may also
demur to a counterclaim or set-off, upon which the de
fendant demands an affirmative judgment, when it ap
pears on its face either :
1. That the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
thereof.
2. That the defendant has not legal capacity to recover
upon the same.
3. That there is another action pending between the
same parties, for the same cause.
4. That the counterclaim is not of the character speci
fied in I 5072.
5. That the counterclaim or set-off does not state
facts sufficient to entitle the defendant to the relief de
manded.
See \ 5062.
SUBDIVISION IV. ANSWER.
§ 5070. What the answer must contain. The answer
shall contain:
1. A general or specific denial of each material alle
gation of the petition controverted by the defendant.
2. A statement of any new matter constituting a de
fense, counterclaim, or set-off, in ordinary and concise
language. [51 v. 57, \ 92 ; S. & C. 975.]
Denial. Only facts material to the cause of action should be
denied. A denial of any other facts presents an immaterial
issue, and if only such issues are made the answer may be
stricken out as frivolous, or the plaintifff may disregard it and
take judgment, Bliss Code PI. § 325. A general and specific
denial is not permitted to the same allegation, 18 How. Pr. 240.
No particular form of denial is required. " The defendant says
it is not true that," etc., or "the defendant denies that," etc.,
is sufficient. Bliss Code PI. § 325. A common form of ￼
general
denial is that "defendant denies each and every allegation
of the petition." This form puts in issue every fact alleged in the
petition, 19 Abb. Pr. 288. A denial, "he says he denies," etc.,
though criticised, is sustained, 18 How. Pr. 210; 74 N. Y. 61.
Matters of inducement averred in the reply are not the subject
of denial, nor allegations of time and value when not of the
substance of the issue, 7 Bosw. 670. Legal conclusions are not
the subject of denial, Bliss Code PI. ? 334 ; as a denial of indebt
edness, 5 Oreg. 86; that a note is "not outstanding," 29 O. S. 13,
or "not in existence," 32 O. S. 449. " Nothing due thereon," 29
O. S. 13, " not liable," 34 O. S. 456, 457, are legal conclusions, and
a failure to deny does not admit them, 31 O. S. 555. But a failure
to deny a material allegation is an admission of it, and tho
admission is conclusive evidence of the tact admitted, 64 Mo. 165.
Denials must be positive and direct. A denial of eacli and
every material allegation of the petition is not good pleading,
6 How. Pr. 312 ; though an answer denying all material alle
gations in the ^petition has been held good on demurrer,
subject to a motion to make more definite and certain, 10 O. 8,
451. A denial of " each and every allegation," etc., is sufficient,
2 W. L. M. 603 ; and a denial of " all averments not admitted "
is good, 1 Clev. R. 218 ; but a denial of averments "in manner
and form as stated," 1 Clev. R. 178, or a denial of "all material
averments," is bad, 1 Clev. R. 123. A denial of " each and every
allegation of the petition in the manner and form as therein set
forth," is faulty, as only referring to the manner and form in
which the plaintifff has stated his cause of action, not to tho
substance of the allegation, 1 Dakota 227. That "defendants do
not admit," is not a good denial, 13 O. S. 263.
Negativepregnant. A denial in the precise language of the peti
tion is not good pleading, Bliss Code PI. J 332; as in an action for
trespass in entering the plaintifff's house, the defendant pleaded
that the plaintifff's daughtergave him license to do so, and that ho
entered by that license, and the plaintifff replied that he did not
enter by her license, Stephens PL [* 381]. A denial of an act
being done unlawfully, or wrongfully, does not deny the act,
but only the character of it, 50 Cal. 610. A denial of wrongfully
and illegally diverting a certain water is an admission of the act
of diversion, 1 Mont. 212. If the plaintifff in an action of unlaw
ful detention avers that defendant unlawfully entered upon and
demanded the premises, and the answer denies that he entered
" unlawfully," it admits the entry and raises an issue only upon
the question of its unlawfulness, 61 Cal. 541. A denial that the
property sued for is of the exact value alleged iu the petition is
an admission of any less value, 22 Cal. 650.
Denials must be specific. Whether the denial be general or
special, it must unequivocabiy appear what is intended to be
denied. Bliss Code PI. g 331. A denial of each and every allega
tion not therein expressly admitted or denied has been disap
proved, and it is held that though the defect be not such as
to exclude evidence supporting the denial, the defendant will
be required to make his answer more definite, 47 N. Y. 430;
111 U. 8. 216. A specific denial must be certain and definite as
to the fact denied. Thus a denial of the rendition of services
in a certain capacity is not a denial of employment in such
capacity,
42 N.denials
Y. Superior
202.any issues, and are virtually an
Conjunctive
do notCt.raise
admission of the allegations they were intended to deny, 51 Cal.
541. If several material facts are stated conjunctively in the petition, the defendant must deny them disjunctively, and not
conjunctively, if he desires to put them in issue, 6 Duer. 43' ; 1
Abb. Pr. 187.
Inconsistent denials are not permissible under the code, and
the same principles apply to answers as to petitions, with
reference to the construction of inconsistent allegations in
pleading, 29 O. S. 651, 655; and the court will on motion compel
an election between them, 30 O. S. 600; but, "unless there is
such irreconcilable repugnancy between such allegations that
the verification of one is of necessity a falsification of the other,"
the rule does not apply, 16 Bull 400 ; as, in an action on a note,
defendant may plead, first, that he did not sign it, and, second,
if he did, the signature was obtained by fraud, 29 O. S. 78; or
where the defendan t denies the execution of the note and pleads
want of consideration, 30 O. S. 600; where the answer contains
a general denial and pleads the statute of limitations, 9 How.
Pr. 57, or justification, 9 How. Pr. 288.
Argumentative denials are not, as a rule, good pleading, 6 How.
Pr. 59, though they have sometimes been allowed to stand, see
35 O. S. 104, subject to a motion to make them more definite
and certain, Bliss Code PI. 1 333.
Denial of knowledge or information. Defendant may deny on
information and belief. A denial of "any knowledge or in
formation concerning the matters alleged sufficient to enable
the defendant to form an opinion respecting them," has been
held good, 11 O.S. 183; 2 D. 223. But a denial that the pleader
" knows nothing of the taking of the lien, except what he learns
from the pleading," 1 11.276, 278; and that " defendant does not
know whether the copy of the instrument sued on is a true one
and calls for proof," 11 O. S. 3S8, are insufficient; and a denial
of any information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of
the matter alleged in the petition is held to raise no issue, 23 la.
250. The denial must be of any knowledge, as well as any infor
mation, where the statute requires it, 62 N. Y. 651; 15 How. Pr.
186. A. corporation, as an individual, may deny upon informa
tion and belief, 5 Civil Proc. R. 431. In an action against a cor
poration, an answer which upon information and belief denies
each and every allegation of the petition except the allegation
of the defendant's incorporation is good, 5 Civ. Proc. R. 431; but
an allegation in an answer upon information and belief that the
defendant is not and never was a corporation does not put in
issue (he incorporation of the defendant, 3 Civ. Proc. R. 263 ; an
answer upon information and belief admitting that both plaint
iff and defendant are corporations, and denying each and every
allegation of the petition is held to create no issue whatever, 33
Hun 143. But it the fact charged is within the defendant's
knowledge, a denial upon information and belief is not suffi
cient, 14 Bull 3 Hi; Bliss Code PI. i 326. The denial in such case
must be positive. 14 Bull 346 ; 24 How. Pr. 133; as where the
facts charged in the petition were acts alleged to be done by the
defendant himself, 62 N. Y. 651 ; or where the acts are alleged to
be done by the defendant's agent or partner, 12 How. Pr. 37 ; or
in the presence of the defendant, 8 How. Pr. 28. A denial on
information and belief of an instrument of record well pleaded
as to execution and delivery does not put these facts in issue, 41
Wis. 436.
117 at may be shenen under a general denial, A party may
give in evidence under a general denial anything that directly tends to disprove the allegations of the petition, 60 Barb.
346 ; 58 How. Pr. 480 ; or which goes to show that the cause
of action sued on never existed, 60 Barb. 346. The true rule is
that under a denial, the defendant should be permitted to show
no fact that does not go to disprove the fact denied, Bliss Code
PL \ 327. In actions to recover real property, it is sufficient if the
defendant denies generally in his answer the title alleged, or
that he withholds possession, § 5782. Under a general denial
defendant may prove any fact tending to show that plaintifff has
not the title or the right of possession, 18 Kas. 508; but new
matter which admits the plaintifff's title, but which shows that
defendant has a right of possession notwithstanding, or that he
has an equitable title, should be pleaded, 36 O. S. 357. A gen
eral denial is sufficient to raise the defense of the statute of lim
itations in this action, 29 O. S. 359 ; and where the answer denies
the title alleged in the petition, other defenses in the answer are
immaterial, 35 O. S. 387. In actions for the recovery of personal
property, a denial puts in issue the plaintifff's ownership, and an
averment that the property belongs to a third person is not new
matter within the meaning of the statute, but another form of
denial of plaintifff's ownership and right of posession, 22 Cal.
164. In an action for goods sold and delivered, the defendant,
under a general denial, may show that they were sold and deliv*
ered to his wife, 33 Ind. 145; in an action for services, that the
services were rendered upon a special agreement to look to the
costs bill for compensation, 18 Barb. 29. In an action for work
and labor upon a quantum meruit, the value of the work is put in
issue under a general denial, and facts may be shown by defend
ant affecting such value, as negligence or unskillfulness, 4 E. D.
Smith 171 ; 13 Cal. 640.
Accord and satisfaction must be specially pleaded, 10 Cal. 30.
Account. An allegation of the amount due on an account is
material and admitted if not denied, 25 O. S. 635. In actions for
the balance of an account, payment is put in issue under a gen
eral denial, 41 N. Y.349. Under a plea of payment, the objection
can not be made that the goods were wrongfully obtained and aro
not thereforee properlythe subject matter of an account, 26 O. S. 562.
Accounting. Ihe right of the defendant to an accounting
must be specially pleaded, 4 Thomp. & C. 642. An answer alleg
ing an award is a good answer to a petition for an accounting,
but it is not a departure in the reply to ask judgment for the
amount of the award, 34 O. S. 294.
Account stated. A mistake or error in an account stated must
be specially pleaded, 16 Minn. 91; 6 Ired. (N. C.) 192; contra, 39
Ind. 338.
Agency. In an action for goods sold and delivered, a defense
that defendant purchased of plaintifff as agent of another and
on his credit, plaintifff having knowledge of the agency, is sus
tained under a general denial, 57 N. Y. 651. Where a sale was
alleged to defendant, and the proof showed a sale to defendant's
agent, it was held that, under a general denial, defendant might
show that the agency had been revoked and plaintifff had notice
of the fact, 47 N. Y. 278. An answer to a petition on a contract
of insurance, that the agent had no authority from the company
to make the contract sued on must be regarded as a denial of
the averment in the petition that " the company agreed to make
said insurance," 24 O. S. 345, 358, and does not contain allega
tions of new matter requiring a reply, Id.
Assault and battery. An answer " that defendant is not guilty
of the grievances alleged, or any or either of them, or any part
thereof," is a good denial, 41 Wis. 251. Evidence may be given
in mitigation, though not pleaded, 6 Bosw. 679. Matters of ag
gravation need not be denied, 14 How. Pr. 46. A plea of moUiter
manus impomit is not a full answer, 17 O. S. 454, and requires a
reply, 2 Ree. 403 ; 25 O. S. 70; see 45 O. S. 177.
Award must be specially pleaded, 1 E. D. Smith 437; 14 Ind.
32. The substance of an award must be sufficiently set forth to
enable the court to say that if made the action is barred, 37
How. Pr. 88 ; 2 Duer. 176. Performance of an award need not
be pleaded, 12 N. Y. 9.
Bankruptcy must be specially pleaded, 38 N. Y. 253. When
not pleaded it can not be assigned as error, 17 O. 362. A simple
averment of discharge setting forth a copy duly authenticated is
sufficient, 16 O. 12, 463. Facts showing jurisdiction to grant the
discharge need not be averred, 59 How. Pr. 93 ; 16 O. 463.
Bills and notes. Evidence showing alteration of a note after
execution is admissible under a denial that defendant made the
note mentioned in the petition, see 26 O S. 673, 676, or under a
general denial, 74 N. Y. 307. An allegation that a note is fraud
ulently altered in a material point after delivery, without the
Anowledge or consent of the maker, is not necessary, as a mate
rial alteration is sufficient to avoid It, 59 la. 545. The answer
must show that the alteration was made with the knowledge
and consent or by the authority of the plaintifff, 2C. C. R. 564;
see 26 O. S. 673. A general answer of no consideration in an
action on a note is good, 80 Ky. 78 ; but failure of consideration
must be specially pleaded, 18 Ind. 300. Defendant may plead a
denial of execution of the note and that there was no consider
ation therefore, 30 O. S. 600. An admission in the answer of the
making, indorsement, and transfer does not preclude the de
fendant from showing that there was no consideration, 1 Hun
582. A general answer of want of consideration, and that the
same was known to plaintifff when he procured the assignment
of the note from the payee, is sufficient, 43 Ind. 38. Where de
fendant pleads that a note is wholly without consideration, and
issue is joined without a statement of facts being required on
which the defense is based, any evidence is admissible which
tends to impeach or sustain the consideration, 15 O. S. 225. An
answer averring that for a good consideration an agreement for
renewal and extension of the note sued on had been made is
good, though it does not allege it to have been made in writing,
77 N. Y. 64. A denial of delivery until after the date averred in
the petition raises no issue, 20 Minn. 382. An allegation that A
" made, executed, and delivered" a promissory note is not put
in issue by an answer denying that he delivered the note, 5
Oreg. 22. In an action on a destroyed note, an answer merely de
nying the existence of the note when the action was brought is
Immaterial, 32 O. S. 449. Under a denial of execution, non-deliv
ery may be shown, 48 Ind. 239, or fraud in obtaining defendant's
signature, 57 Mo. 452; under a defense that defendant did not
" make, sign, or deliver," thnt defendant's name was forged, or,
if genuine, was obtained by fraud, 29 O. S. 480. Denial of execu
tion will not sustain the defense that the note was given for a
firm debt, nor that a special arrangement for its payment was
agreed on, 36 la. 566 ; or that defendant could not read nor write
and did not know it was a note, 32 Ark. 327. If the defendant
does not deny the execution, he must plead the special matter
in discharge and an answer that a note " was not outstanding : "
that "there is nothing due on the note " may be stricken out by
the court of its own motion. 29 O. S. 13. An answer alleging
that the note sued on was obtained byfraud, misrepresentation,
and covin, without specifically setting forth the facts consti
tuting the fraud, presents an issue of fact requiring a reply, 80
Ky. 78. An answer that the note sued on was obtained by false
representations, without stating what the representations were,
has been held had, 34 Ark. 169; likewise an answer of fraud and
want of consideration without averring plaintifff's knowledge, 1
Clev. R. 141, and an answer by a guarantor that he signed aa indorser, 1 Clev. R. 219. Illegality must be pleaded, unless sup
plied hy the admissions of the petition, 9 O. S. 461, An answer
denying plaintifff's oumership is good, 1 Clev. R. 173; an answer
that defendant " is ignorant as to whether plaintifff is the owner
of the note sued on or indorsee, and thereforee denies the same,"
is sufficient, 1 Clev. R. 194. Where the liability of defendant
depends on whether a promissory note was an outstanding
security at a certain date, an averment in his answer of jmyment
prior to such date hy a new note of the same maker is sufficient
on demurrer, 37 O. S. 26. An answer of payment requires a
reply,
25 O.InS.an276.action on a bond alleged to have been lost,
Bond.
defendant may show, under a general denial, that he never
executed the alleged bond, 70 Ind. 310. In an action by a
sheriff upon an indemnity bond given to indemnify him
against levy and sale on execution of property claimed by a
third person, the sureties may prove in mitigation under a gen
eral denial the amount received by the sheriff under the sale,
58 N. Y. 373. In an action on a bond given for faithful perform
ance of duties, a surety may show in evidence under a general
denial a settlement between the plaintifff and the pincipal in
the bond of all demands against the latter, 75 Mo. 458. Matter
In discharge or avoidance must be specially pleaded, 3 McLean
303; and the defense that a bond was illegally taken should set
forth the facts constituting the illegality, 1 Gall. X6. A general
plea of performance in answer to a petition assigning a particu
lar breach is bad on demurrer. 13 Barb. 305. An answer setting
up fraud in obtaining a surety on an administrator's bond is a
good defense, 41 O. S. 588.
Breach ofpromise of marriage. Under a general denial, defend
ant may show in mitigation that plaintifff' drank to excess and
sometimes got Intoxicated, 5 Abb. Pr. n. s. 29 ; even that plaintifff
committed an act of adultery more than twenty-five years pre
viously, 3 Thomp. & C. 424. If unsuccessful," the defense of
unchastity may be matter of aggravation, 42 N. Y. 474, but not
unless it is interposed in bad faith, from malice, wantonness, or
recklessness, 12 O. S. 312. Defendant mny show in mitigation
that he was afflicted with an incurable disease at the time of the
breach, of promise to marry, 51 111. 288; but he can not defend
on the ground that he was afflicted with a venereal disease, if it
was contracted after the promise was made, or before, and he
knew the disease was incurable, 86 N. C. 91 ; 41 Am. R. 444.
Infancy is a good defense, 31 O. S. 521 ; but it is no defense that
defendant was married at the time of the promise if plaintifff
was ignorant of the fact, 106 Mass. 339, or that plaintifff had
previously contracted to marry another person, 18 Mo. 383.
Consideration. If a contract imports consideration as evi
denced by a sealed instrument or negotiable paper, or in some
states by other writings, it is unnecessary for plaintifff either to
plead or prove consideration; and when defendant is permit
ted to avail himself of the want of it, it is new matter to be
specially pleaded, Bliss Code PI. § 330 ; 25 Am. Law Reg. 570, and
cannot be proved under a general denial, 95 Ind. 116; 58 How.
Pr. 426; but in actions upon other contracts, the petition must
averorshow consideration, and under a general denial defendant
may prove the want of it, Bliss Code PI. § 330; 60 Barb. 346. Ille
gality of consideration must be specially pleaded. 24 O. S. 61 5, 621 ;
a failure of consideration must be specially pleaded, 56 N. Y. 673.
Concersion. Under a general denial, defendant may show
that plaintifff had no title to the property, 14 Barb. 536; that
plaintifff consented to the taking, 37 la. 192; that at the time of
the alleged conversion the ownership and right of possession
were in a third person, 6 Dner. 254; 45 Ind. 66 (but the weight of
authority is that he can not show this unless he connects him
self in some manner with that title, Boone Code PL \ 137; 17
Wis. 550; 19 Fla. 42; see 20 la. 429. Defendant need not plead
that he owned the property at the commencement of the action,
nor show the source of nor mode by which he acquired title, a
general denial of plaintifff's ownership being sufficient, Boone
Code PL § 137 ; 8 Jones & S. 211); that defendant had a mortgage
on the property, 17 Jones & S. 302; that the property was taken
on execution against plaintifff, 5 Kas. 284. In an action for the
conversion of a note, defendant may show, under a general
denial in reduction of damages, inability of the maker to pay
wholly or partially, 56 N. Y. 22, 27; that notes were never
received as collateral, and that, if received, they were lost with
out plaintifff s fault, 24 Wis. 319. In an action for the conversion
of a boat, it was held that conduct of the plaintifff amounting
to an estoppel to claim title to the boat might have been given
in evidence on the question of title without being specially
pleaded, 66 Barb. 495.
Corporations. A general denial does not put in issue corporate
existence. It must be specially pleaded when the petition does
not disclose want of capacity to sue, 26 O. S. 565. Under the
New York Code, the existence of a corporation need not be
proved in an action by it. unless the answer is verified and con
tains an affirmative allegation that the plaintifff or defendant is
not a corporation, N. Y. Code Civil Pro. § 1776.
Damages. Under § 5081, allegations of value or of amount
of damages shall not be considered as true by failure to
controvert them. This does not apply to the amount claimed
in contracts for the payment of money only, and in an action
on an account the allegation of amount is material and admitted
by failure to deny, 25 O. S. 635. 638.
Estoppel. Facts constituting an estoppel must be pleaded, 93
Tnd. 570; 47 Am. Rep. 394; 77 Mo. 235 ; contra, 66 Barb. 495. The
answer must show that plaintifff had knowledge of the facts
constituting the estoppel, 90 Ind. 291.
Executors and administrators. Plaintiff's representative caty is put in issue by a general denial, 13 Mo. App. 114 ; con38 Wis. 613; 60 la. 407. A defense by an administrator that the claim sued on was not presented for allowance before tha
action was brought, should aver all the facta of publication, etc.,
38 N. J. L. 161 ; but such defense is waived where the admlulstrator joins issue and goes to trial on the validity of the claim
without objection, 36 O. S. 454. In an action against an adminis
trator on a note which matured more than fifteen yean before
the commencement of the suit, where it is alleged in the petition
that before the expiration of fifteen years from its maturity the
note duly verified was presented to the administrator for allow
ance as a valid claim against the estate, and the same was duly
allowed, an answer which does not deny the fact of such allow,
ance, but simply avers that the action was not commenced
within fifteen years from the maturity of the note, is bad on
demurrer,
39 O.beS.specially
112.
Fraud must
pleaded, Pomeroy Rem. \ 6R7 ; 27 Cal.
656; 18 Minn. 470. A general denial is not sufficient, 10 Rec.572;
5 How. Pr. 14. It has been held that an objection to the insuf
ficiency of the answer, for omitting to state facta constituting
fraud, will not be considered on appeal if not raised in the
court below, 34 Cal. 100; but where the answer omitted to state
that plaintifffs intended to deceive, and defendants were in fact
deceived, it was held insufficient on appeal, though no objection
was made to it on the trial, 52 N. Y. 621. An answer setting up
fraudulent representations in procuring a contract must state
in what the representations consisted, 27 Cal. 656; that they
were made with intent to defraud, 56 N. Y. 673 ; that defendant
was deceived by them, or his belief in their truth induced him
to enter into the contract, 57 Barb. 84; 13 How. Pr. 458; and that
damage resulted from such false representations, 43 N. Y. Supe
rior Court 131. "An answer of fraud must contain ail tho
elements necessary to be proved to make out the fraud, and
these are that the representation must go to the material fact;
must be made under such circumstances that the party had a
right to rely on it, and it must be false to a material extent,"
19Ind. 2S, 29; 11 Ind. 337. An answer that a note was obtained
by false representations should aver that the agent who made
them knew they were false, 61 Ind. 520. Where the petition in
an action against a principal for fraud committed by his agent
properly states a cause of action, and aveis that the fraud was
not discovered until within four years before suit was begun, an
answer charging that the cause of action did not accrue withi.i
four years before suit, because the fraud was nut committed
within such time, is insufficient, 40 O. S. 313.
Insurance. Breaches of conditions other than conditions pre
cedent must be specially pleaded, 14 Blatchf. 422; a condition
that the insured if requested should exhibit to the insurer upon
adjustment of loss his books of account, etc., 45 Mo. 8 1 ; a breach
of warranty, 6 Thomp. & C. 364; where a condition becomes op
erative only in the eveutof a request in writing. 46 Ind. 316, In
such cases the answer must plead the conditions specially.
The defense of arson must be specially averred, 37 Mich. 103.
It has been held that the defense of concealment of a material
fact when the application was made, which would have in
creased the preminm, must also state that the insured knew of
its existence, and that the fact was not notorious and open to
all parties, 1 H. 408 ; but see 5 O. S. 478. An answer setting up a
false statement in the application should state the particular
violation claimed, 17 Hun 602.
Judgments. See \\ 5090, 5310-5319. Under a general denial,
defendant can not show that the judgment sued on was, subse
quent to Its eutry, vacated by order ofcourt, 4 Daly, 89; nor can
he under a general denial attack the regularity of the proceed
ings on which the judgment was based, 8 Kas. 125. The only
inquiry that can be made on such issue is whether such judg
ment was rendered and had the court jurisdiction of the par
ties and subject matter, Id. The answer may show that the
judgment was obtained by fraud, 12 N. Y. 156, and in some cases
though the facts constituting the fraud are not stated, 20 Mo.
494; 17 Abb. Pr. 405. So in a suit on a foreign judgment defend
ant may plead that it was obtained by fraud, 57 Mo. 425. The
answer may set up an agreement to dismiss the suit, on which
defendant relying failed to appear, 21 la. 58. In an action on
a foreign judgment, he may plead that in the original suit he
was not served with process, and that an appearance entered
on his behalf was fraudulent, though such defense contradicts
the recitals contained in that record, 51 Mo. 69. If defendant is
served, the foreign judgment is conclusive; if not, only prima
facie evidence, 1 O. 259 ; 6 O.43. In a suit against two defend
ants on a foreign judgment, one of such defendants can plead
want of jurisdiction in the foreign court over his co-defendant,
34 N. J. L. 286. Where a general denial is pleaded in an action
on a foreign judgment, a further answer of nul tiel record is sur
plusage, 13 Ind. 83.
Justification. The facts relied on and proposed to be offered
In evidence must be specially pleaded, 32 O. S. 604 ; 16 O. 88.
The particulars must be alleged, 55 How. Pr. 55.
Libel and slander, § 5094. Under a general denial, circum
stances in mitigation may be proved under the code, 3. W. L. M.
100; 32 O. S. 604, as at common law, 16 O. 88 ; 5 O. S. 293 ; and
it has been held that a plea of mitigating facts should be stricken
out, 2 W. L. M. 437. though such facts may be pleaded in con
nection with a justification, 1 D. 458. A justification must be
specially pleaded, and can not be proved under a general denial,
32 O. S. 604 ; 6 O. S. 516. The answer must state the offense of
which the plaintifff is alleged to hnve been guilty, giving time,
place, and circumstances. 28 How. Pr. 97. The plea of justifica
tion must be as broad as the charge. 1 D. 482; 5 O. S. 293 ; it must
show specific acts, including the intent, 5 O. S. 293; W. 683;
4 Bull 61. A plea of justification is no aggravation of the
wrong, unless it be used by defendant maliciously and with
knowledge of its falsity, 46 N. Y. 427 ; but where it is made in
g ood faith, under an honest belief of the words spoken and
with reasonable ground for such belief, the plaintifff is not, by
reason of such plea, on failure of proof to sustain it, entitled to
exemplary damages, nor should it be regarded as an aggrava
tion beyond the real injury sustained by plaintifff, 14 O.8.283;
see 12 O. S. 312. Mere inability to establish a justification is no
evidence of malice, and will not warrant the inference of malice
by the jury, 10 Daly 254. Privilege of witness, counsel, 20 Boll
186, 189, 193.
License. The defense of license must he specially pleaded,
32 Barb. 293 ; 81 N. Y. 52. In an action for unlawfully taking
and converting property, evidence offered to justify the taking,
by showing a license, is not admissible under a general denial,
82 Barb. 293 ; contra, 37 la. 192 ; but defendant in an action of
trespass may in his answer deny the plaintifff's title, and also
plead a license to do the act complained of, the latter plea not
being an admission of the plaintifff's title, 12 Minn. 426.
Malicious prosecution. A general denial puts in issue the alle
gations of the petition alleging malice and want of prolnble
cause, Pomeroy Rem. §680; 40Ind.356; 12 Abb. I-r.446; though
it has been held that the grounds showing probable cause
should be pleaded in the answer, 1 D. 579. Under a general
denial, defendant may show that he acted upon the advice of
counsel learned in the law on a full statement of*the facte, 39
Cal. 485 ; 6 Barb. S3 ; see 16 O. S. 468, 469.
Mitigation. Circumstances in mitigation may be shown under
a general denial, and need not be set up in the answer, 82 O. S.
604; in slander and libel, Id.; iu an action for breach of promise
of marriage, 5 Abb. n. s. 29; for assault or false imprisonment
6Bosw. 679; seduction, 25 Hun 498; for conversion of goods, 43
How. Pr. 5.
Mortgage. Foreclosure. The mortgagor may set up title in a
third person named as a defense, 16 Hun 237 ; that plaintifff pro
cured an assignment of the mortgage by fraud, and that the
debt has been paid to the mortgagee and a release received, 57
N. Y. 643. He may set up mistake in the drawing of the mort
gage and claim reformation, 47 N. Y. 487. Where the mortgage
imports consideration, the want of consideration must be set up
in the answer in foreclosure, unless that fact clearly appears
upon the face of the petition, 65 Ala. 558. It is no drfense that
the mortgagor had no title to the premises, 6I Iud. 511 ; or that
his title is defective, 29 Hun 671 ; or that the note secured by the
mortgage was altered, 18 Hun 10 ; or that the mortgage is of no
binding effect, and no lien upon the premises described in the
petition, 7 Lans. 416.
Negligence. If plaintifff can prove his case without disclosing
contributory negligence, such contributory negligence is matter
of defense to be proved by defendant, 35 O. S. 627 ; and the peti
tion need not deny contributory negligence, 40 O. S. 376; and
where plaintifff need not deny it, it may be proved under a gen
eral denial, 20 Winn. 277, 307; contra, 5 Neb. 117, 123. Under a
general denial, evidence is admissible to show that the injury
was caused by other persons, not the servants or agents of de
fendant, 15 O. S. 211. Where one was sued for damages for neg
ligence in opening a ditch, whereby water was let into the
plaintifff's premises, it was held he might show under a general
denial that the water came from a defective sewer, 14 Abb. Pr.
n. s. 371. Proof of vis major or act of God is held not admissible
unless specially pleaded, 6 Abb. Pr. n. s. 128 ; contra, 77 Mo. 518 ;
S. C. Mo. 16 Bull 427. Where plaintifff averred thut defendant re
ceived and agreed for a reward to transport a case of "plate"
glass, which was broken through defendant's negligence, under
a general denial, evidence was allowed to be introduced that it
gave a receipt for "one case of rough glass," on which was
plainly marked " actual contents of packages must be stated on
this receipt," as showing that deiendant did not receive and
agree to transport plate glass, 41 O. S. 166. In an action for dam
ages to plaintifff 's goods through defendant's negligence, de
fendant may show under a general denial that the goods did not
belong to the plaintifff, 4 Daly 329.
Ownership or title. See supra, p. 103.
Payment. The defense of payment is new matter and must be
specially pleaded, 25 O. 8. 276. It can not be shown under a general denial, except where plaintifff alleges an indebtedness
generally without showing how it was created, 7 Kas. 412; or
where plaintifff sues for a balance on an account or balance due
for services, 41 N. Y. 349 ; 46 N. Y. 418, when it becomes neces
sary to inquire into the payments to ascertain such balance.
Bliss Code 1'1. § 357. In an action on an account for goods sold
and delivered, a plea of payment can not be maintained when
the payment is by check and the drawer has no funds in the
hands of the drawee to meet it, 43 O. S. 53.
Pendency of another action should be specially pleaded, 42 O. S.
299, unless the facts appear on the face of the petition, when it
must be taken advantage of by demurrer, 2 H. 69, 72. The
answer must allege that the first cause was pending when the
second was commenced, 57 How. Pr. 390, and is still pending at
the time the answer is interposed, 2 Oreg. 49, and that the parties
and subject matter are the same, 27 Ark. 315.
Sales. Undera general denial, in an action for goods sold, de
fendant may show they were sold and delivered to his wife, 33
Ind. 145. In an action for the consideration of a patent right,
defendant, under a general denial, may show that the patent
was not the sole consideration, but that something else was also
to be conveyed, 38 N. Y. 263 ; in an action for goods sold and de
livered that he' purchased as agent upon the credit of his prin
cipal, 57 N. Y. 651 ; or that the authority of the agent who made
the purchase had been revoked and that plaintifff knew this, 47
N. Y. 278. Where the petition avers the sale and delivery to the
defendant of goods and their value, an answer which denies the
indebtedness, but does not deny the facts, the sale and delivery
and amount of goods does not raise an issue, as it only denies
the legal conclusion resulting from the facts, 35 Cal. 452.
Services. Under a general denial in an action for work and
labor upon a quantum meruit, facts may be shown affecting its
value, as negligence or uuskilfullness, 4 E. D. Smith 171; 13 Cal,
640; or that the services were rendered under a special agree
ment to perform them at a less sum than that claimed, 61 Ind,
368 ; or that they were rendered upon a special agreement to look
to the costs bill for compensation, 18 Barb. 29; and in an action
for attorneys' services under a general denial, defendant may
show facts tending to disprove the allegations of the petition
that the conditions of the contract have been performed by the
plaintifff, 92 N. Y. 209, but under a mere denial of value defend
ant can not show that the services were not rendered, 57 N. Y.
429. A denial of the rendition of services in a certain capacity
is not a denial of employmen tin such capacity, 42 N. Y. Superior
Ct. 202. Payment can not be shown under a general denial,
supra, unless as was stated the action is for a balance due, 41
N. i. 349; nor conversion by plaintifff of the thing in respect to
which the services were alleged to have been rendered, 54 N. Y.
658 ; nor, in an action by an officer against a city for salary, that
the employment was in excess of authority, or that the fund for
the payment of such salary had been exhausted, 62 N. Y. 365 ;
nor, in an action to recover for services as broker, that the broker
was acting for both parties without the knowledge of his prin
cipal, 11 Jones & S. 564 ; nor, in an action to recover the value of
work and material, can defendant under a general denial show
an express contract that the rate of compensation should be sub
mitted to the arbitrament of a third person from whose decision
there could be no appeal, 22 Minn. 267.
A general denial raises the defense of the
statute of frauds, 36 O. S. 331; but where the contract set forth
in the petition Is admitted by the answer, the Hatute must be
specially pleaded or the defense will be waived, 46 N. Y. 223, 226 ;
66 N. Y. 206. Where the defendant relies on a contract which U
within the statute, he must aver that it is in writing to avail
himself of the defense, 31 O. S. 579. Where the agreement sued
on is within the statute, and it is fairly to be inferred from the
petition that it is not in writing, the defense of the statute is
available on demurrer, 37 O. S. 402 ; see 4i o. s. 2», 543.
Statute of limitations. The statute of limitations mast be spe
cially pleaded when taken advantage of by answer, 8 O. S. 215 ;
23 O. S. 209 ; 29 O. S. 245. " The bar of the statute of limitations
becomes available on demurrer only when the petition snows
affirmatively that the statutory period had elapsed before the
action was commenced. When this does not appear, the statute
must be pleaded," 23 O. S. 209; see 44 O. S. 12. It is waived if
not taken advantage of by demurrer or answer, 29 O. S. 245. A
general denial waives it, 30 O. S. 184 ; contra, in ejectment, 29
O. S. 359. A foreign statute must be specially pleaded to be
available as a bar, and such defense can not be raised by de
murrer, 13 Minn. 390 ; see 26 O. S. 131. Such plea must state the
residence of parties. 7 O. (Pt. 1) 229. If a petition properly states
a cause of action for fraud, and nvers that the fraud was not dis
covered until within four years before suit was begun, an answer
charging that the cause of action did not accrue within four
vears before suit, because the fraud was not committed within
said time, is insufficient, 40 O. S. 313 ; see 21 Bull 212.
Stockhotder. In an action to enforce the statutory liability
of stockholders, an answer that defendant " never had any stock
of the said corporation in his possession, and that he never
subscribed for any of said stock, "aoes not state a good defense,
14 Bull 346, 347. An answer that defendants "deny they are
stockholders of the said defendant . . . They further pay that
they were not stockholders in said company at the time the said
aotes set up in said answer and cross-petition were executed and
delivered, nor were they stockholders at the time of the recovery
of said judgment," set up in the petition of the plaintifff is not
sufficient, as it implies that defendants were stockholders at
some time, Id. A defense in such action that there are stock
holders who have not been made parties, or paid their subscrip
tions, should disclose the names of such, 15 Bull 104. A defense
that a creditor compromised his claim "before he obtained
judgment," is demurrable, and a defense that a creditor filed his
claim and asserted a lien in another case without averring its
payment or allowance, is demurrable, 15 Bull 164. A sale of
stock with an indemnity to the vendor against assessment on
his liability is no defense, Id.
Surety. An extension of time, to be available as a defense,
'must be specially pleaded, 22 Barb. 647. An averment in the
answer of a surety, that he had requested the plaintifff to sue the
maker under § 5833, is insufficient without a further allegation
that the request was in writing, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 229 ; contra, 55 Mo. 31.
Where one of two joint debtors has paid the whole debt, facts
which rebut the presumed equity to contribute should be set up
by way of defense, and need not be negatived in the petition, 26
O. S. 450, 452.
Trespass. Under a general denial, defendant may prove that
Elaintiff was not in possession, but that he had leased the prem
ies, 60 Cal. 4% ; but it has been held, on the other hand, that a
right of possession or title in a third person must be specially
pleaded. 10 How. Pr. 178. Matter in justification must be spe
cially pleaded, 11 Johns. 132, as a license, 54 Wis. 133 ; and if an
easement is relied on as a defense by way of justification, the
answer must show how the enjoyment of it was impeded, 32
Cal. 578.
Usury. The defense of usury must be specially pleaded, 87
N. Y. 430 ; 12 Barb. 601. It must be pleaded with such precision
and certainty as to make out on the face of the pleading that a
corrupt and usurious contract has been entered into, 75 N. Y.
519. The defense should state what the usurious agreement was,
between whom made, and the quantum of usurious interest
agreed on and received, 21 N. Y. 567 ; and in pleading usury laws
of another state, the defense must allege what those laws were,
and the facts which rendered the transaction usurious under
them, 22 N. Y. 472.
§ 5071. Defendant may state different defenses, eto.
The defendant may set forth in his answer as many
grounds of defense, counterclaim, and set-off as he has,
whether they are such as have been heretofore denom
inated legal or equitable, or both ; he may claim therein
relief touching the matters in question in the petition
against the plaintifff, or against other defendants in the
same action ; and each must be separately stated and
numbered, and they must refer in an intelligible manner
to the causes of action which they are intended to
answer. [51 v. 57, % 84, 93 ; S. & C. 968, 978.]
Joinder of defenses. There is no limit to the number of de
fenses which may be joined in an answer. 39 O. S. 141 ; 29 O. S. 78.
It is not required that they must be consistent with each other,
29 O. S. 78. A denial and justification may be joined, 9 How. Pr.
289; 33 Ind. 486. A denial and the statute of limitations, 30 Cal.
192; pleas in abatement and bar may now be joined in the same
answer, 21 N. Y. 399; in trespass, a denial of plaintifff's title and
license to do the act complained of, 12 Minn. 426; adenialofthe
execution of a note and plea of infancy, 2 E. D. Smith 50. In an
action for breach of contract, defendant may plead a rescission
of the contract for fraud or mistake and breach of warranty, 67
N. Y. 237. A denial of the execution of a note and a plea that if
the signature was genuine it was obtained by fraud may be
joined in the same answer, 29 O. S. 78. Usury, extension of time,
and payment are not inconsistent in an answer of a surety on a
promissory note, 14 Kas. 282; nor a denial of the execution of a
note and want of consideration, 30 O. S. 600. A plea of the stat
ute of limitations and satisfaction of the demand in suit may
be joined, 13 Minn. 158; but a denial of the execution of an
instrument and that it was executed under duress, are held
inconsistent, 16 Kas. 259 ; and a denial and tender, 2 E. D. Smith
197 ; and a denial of the taking of goods and justification under
process, 5 Minn. 119; and a denial of a contract and an allegatfcin of non-performance, 11 How. Pr. 163: a pica that a contract
was revoked or annulled and another that It was modified, 19
Minn. 407 ; a denial of forfeiture of curtesy and claim of owner
ship, 1 Clev. R. 117; and denial and estoppel, 1 Clev. R. 141.
Joint answer*. There is no limit to the right of prni,er parties
defendaut to join in an answer, 14 O. S. 211. An answer by one
of the makers of a note inures to the others, 26 O. S. 291 ; and
where a defense, pleaded jointly by several defendants, is bad
as to one it is bad as to all, 95 Ind. 184 ; 10 la. 58.
A partial defense may beset up, but it must be pleaded as such,
70 Ind. 309; 15 la. 6; but a paragraph of an answer which is
expressly limited to a part of the petition can not be declared
bad merely because it goes to the whole of the petition, 99 Ind.
566. It is not necessary that an answer to a petition seeking
equitable relief should set up a complete defense, it is enough
that it deny or confess and avoid some material part of the
plaintiffPs case so as to modify or abridge the right to relief, and
a demurrer to such answer raises no question of Its sufficiency as
a complete bar to the action, 18 O. S. 490; see 37 O. S. 36:1. Under
the New York Code, a partial defense may be set forth in the
answer, but it must be expressly stated to be a partial defense to
the entire complaint, or to one or more separate causes of action
therein set forth, N. Y. Code, Civ. Pro. § 508.
§5072. Counter-claim. The counterclaim mentioned
in the preceding section must be one existing in favor
of a defendant, and against a plaintifff, between whom a
several judgment might be had in the action, and aris
ing out of the contract or transaction set forth in the
petition as the foundation of the plaintifff's claim, or
connected with the subject of the action. [51 v. 67,
§ 94; S.&C. 979.]
The counterclaim must be founded on an existing demand
inpresenti, and not one that may be claimed in futuro, 10 Boaw.
1& The demands must be mutual, and, where plaintifff sues as
an individual, a demand against him as trustee or executor can
not be set up by way of counterclaim, 20 Johns. 137. it is not
required that the counterclaim shall be founded on contract or
arise out of the contract set forth in the petition, 15 B. Mon. 454.
It is sufficient if it arise out of the transaction set forth in the
petition or is connected with the subject of the action, 1 H. 431 ;
2 Id. 86, 229; 2 C. S. C. R. 66. The words " subject of the action "
are construed to mean the subject matter in dispute or the facts
constituting plaintifff's cause of action, 41 How. Pr. 125. The
subject of an action is either property (as illustrated by a real
action ) or a violated right, 61 N. Y. 226 ( Dwight Com.). A counter
claim maybe of a legal or equitable defense, 20 O. S. 38, for
liquidated or unliquidated damages, 12 O. S. 344. A counter
claim must be specially pleaded, 49 Cal. 165 ; 2 H. 233. An answer
which assumes to set iip a counterclaim, or a cause of action for
affirmative relief, should state all the facts necessary 1o consti
tute such counterclaim or affirmative relief as fully and specific
ally as if the defendant were filing a petition in an original
action, 6 O. S. 207, 216 ; i Duer. 285 ; but an answer, however
unskillfully drawn, which contains necessary facts to warrant
affirmative relief will be treated as a counterclaim and such
relief awarded, 14 O. S. 31; and where plaintifff, without objec
tion, takes issue upon an answer setting up a cross-demand in
the nature of a counterclaim, he waives the question whether
such cross-demnnd was the proper subject of a counterclaim,
30 O. S. 444. But the defendant is not bound to set up his
counterclaim ; he may elect to enforce its recovery in a separate
action, 60 Barb. 35. If, however, he does plead a counterclaim,
he can not, during the pendency of the action, have a separate
action upon it, ON. C. 187, 197; but see § 5080; and it is not error to
refuse to consider a counterclaim on which the defendants have
already instituted an independent suit then pending, 2 Bull 110.
It is tjo late ou error to object that a counterclaim arose after the
commencement of the action, 29 N. Y. 494, and the objection
that a claim set up in the answer was not the proper subject
of a counterclaim can not be raised for the first time on
appeal, 94 N. Y. 401. PIaintiff, after an answer amounting to a
counterclaim has been filed, can not dismiss the action, 14 O. S.
31 ; but where the allegations of an answer are not such as
entitle defendant to affirmative relief, such answer does not pre
sent a counterclaim which the defendant has a right to have
tried after the plaintifff's cause of action has been dismissed
without prejudice, 30 O. S. 126. A counterclaim for damages
can not be changed into a claim for specific performance, 1 H.
434,437. The jury should, in assessing damages on a counter
claim, deduct the amount admitted to be due the plaintifff. In
such case, the verdict ought to show it, and if the deduction is
not made by the jury it will be made by the court in rendering
judgment, 20 O. S. 632. Judgment will not be reversed where
the court fails to give nominal damages on a counterclaim if
such omission did not affect the costs or other rights of defend
ants, 6 O. S. 207; 26 O. S. 562; 29 O/S. 362. A justice can not
rule the counterclaim out of the record because no evidence was
given to support it, 6 Bull 327; see generally Id. 774 ; 3 Bull 428.
In an equity case a counterclaim, though for damages, may be
referred to a master, 36 O. S. 261.
Account. Where the dealings between the parties have been '
such as to entitle the defendants to a bill of account under the
old practice in equity, a counterclaim may be based upon any of
the items in that account, 2 H. 233.
Assessment. In nn action in the name of the city for the use
of a contractor to recover an improvement assessment, lotowners can not counterclaim damages caused by the contractor,
who had been licensed by such owners to dig on their premises
for material, for abusing such license and digging deeper than
was authorized, 1 Bull 84. It is no defense to an action for a
street assessment that in improving the street private property
had been taken in places where the right of way was too nar
row, where the proprietors were aware of the progress of the
work and took no steps to restrain it, 5 Rec. 153.
Bills and notes. Defendant may counterclaim for usurious
interest paid, 16 O. S. 418. Partial failure of consideration of a
note is a good counterclaim, 26 O. S. 33; but an answer to
an action on a note that it was obtained by fraud and with
out consideration is not a counterclaim, 30 O. S. 126. In an
action against a surety upon a promissory note, it was held that
defendant might counterclaim damages (or a failure on the
part of the payee to procure the signature of another surety an he
had agreed to do, 2 Duv. 247. In an action on a note, defendant,
it was held, might counterclaim for damages arising from a
wrongful sale of property pledged as security for the note, 9
Wis. 348, or damages sustained by reason of a breach of a fraudu
lent warranty of consideration, 65 Barb. 169. Violation of agree
ment to sell good-will as counterclaim to action on note, 2 Bull
22. Notes given defendant for excess of his pro rata in compo
sition with plaintifffs creditors can not be set off, 1 Bull 302.
Contract. In an action for compensation for the performance
of a contract, defendant can not set up by way of counterclaim
the non-performance of another contract, 1 11. 434, 437. In an
action against a builder to recover deduction from the prico
paid for erecting a building and for goods sold and delivered, a
counterclaim by the builder alleging violation of the building
contract by permitting an adjoining owner to run up his parti
tion wall, whereby defendant was hindered and damaged, is
demurrable, 2 C. S. C. R. 66. PIaintiff can not, by an action for
installments, avoid recoupment on entire contract. 3 O. S. 333.
Conversion. In an action for conversion, a cause of action
upon contract is not proper as a counterclaim, 11 Abb. Pr. 210;
nor in such action can defendant set up by way of counterclaim
a cause of action for the conversion of certain other property, 3
Abb. Pr. 184; but in an action for the conversion oi prop
erty delivered to defendant, it was held that he might counter
claim damages arising from a breach of the contract under
which the property was delivered as being connected with the
subject of the action, 71 Mo. 560; and where defendant was sued
for the conversion of a horse he was permitted to set up the fact
that the horse was sold by him in exchange for some land, that
the plaintifff fraudulently deceived him in regard to its location,
and to ask for a rescission of the contract of exchange, 66 N. C.
233; see 93 N. Y. 552.
Executor and administrator. In an action by an executor upon
a demand which arose after the death of the testator, the de
fendant can not set off a demand against testator, although it
existed at the time of his death, 6 N. Y. 168. A purchaser at ex
ecutor's sale can not counterclaim for false representations of
executor, 14 O. S. 276; but in an action by an executor upon a
demand due his testator, false and fraudulent representations
made by the latter in a sale out of which the demand arose con
stitute a good counterclaim, 52 N. Y. 237.
Fraud in the consideration of a deed, 2 D. 604, in action to
foreclose mortgage, 40 O. S. 168, on note for price of property, 4
O. S. 680, may be set up by way of counterclaim.
Husband and wife. Where a wife sues to recover a claim for
her separate estate, a debt due from her husband can not be
pleaded as a counterclaim, 40 Barb. 75.
Inn-keeper. In an action against an inn-keeper or boardinghouse keeper for the loss of goods upon his liability as bailee of
a guest's property, the defendant may set up as a counterclaim
the plaintifff's indebtedness to him for board, 9 Abb. Pr. N.
S. 199.
Joint and several liability. One of two joint defendants can not
interpose a counterclaim unless there can be under the plead
ings a several judgment against him, 2 Abb. N. C. 216, but one
of several defendants may, by counterclaim, set up a demand
due him severally, 57 Ala. 473; but a counterclaim can not be
allowed to one of several defendants when it appears that an
other of the defendants is primarily liable for the claim de
manded, 5 O. S. 520. If one defendant is sued upon an indi
vidual liability, he can not interpose a counterclaim jointly in
favor of himself and another against the plaintifff, 87 N. Y. 501.
Landlord and tenant. In an action for rent, defendant may
counterclaim damages arising from breaches of covenants in
the lease, 56 N. Y. 420 ; 30 Wis. 611 ; 9 Bush. 708; as breach of a
covenant to repair, 45 How. Pr. 340; 54 Ind. 544; the amount
expended by him in necessary repairs, and damages for the loss
of the use of parts of the premises rendered untenantable for
want of repair, 33 Barb. 401, though the covenants to pay rent
and repair were separate and independent covenants, 35 N. Y.
269; 3 Mo. App. 291. In an action for rent due upon a verbal
lease, defendant may show that plaintifff, by the terms of the
lease, agreed to build a certain fence, and counterclaim dam
ages arising from his neglect to build it, 49 Mo. 139. In an
action by a tenant to annul a lease for fraud, the landlord may
counterclaim rent accrued under the lease, 3 Abb. N. S. 467. In
an action upon a lease for taking away fixtures contrary to its
terms, it was held that defendant could counterclaim as for a
conversion the value of certain chattels which the plaintifff
would not allow him to remove, 25 Wis. 310; but in an action
upon a bond for rent, where defendant sought to recover dam
ages of the plaintifff on account of the removal of fixtures
Slaced upon the premises by the tenant, he was not allowed to
o so, as nothing nad been said in regard to them in the lease, S
Bosw. 300 S. C.; 12 Abb. Pr. 300. In an action upon a lease for
rent, a counterclaim that plaintifff, through defective pipes,
negligently and maliciously permitted the waste water from the
upper stories to flow In upon the part occupied by defendant,
and that he threw filthy water from the windows so as to run in
upon the demised premises, was held bad on demurrer, 20 N. Y.
281; and where a lessor permitted rooms above those occupied
by the lessee as a lawyer's office to be used for the business of
printing, which disturbed the lessee and compelled him some
times to leave his office, and broke the ceilings and damaged his
lurnitureand books by leakage, but he did not surrender pos
session, it was held that he could not counterclaim the dam
age in an action for the rent, 90 N. Y. 293. Injury to the tenant in
consequence of a change in the grade of a street can not, in the
absence of any covenant in the lease protecting him from such
Injury, be set up as a counterclaim in an action for the recovery
of rent, 65 N. Y. 1.
Mortgage. In an action by a mortgagee against a mortgagor
upon a note and mortgage given for the purchase money of the
premises, the mortgagor may set up a counterclaim for dam
ages by reason of the fraud of the mortgagee in concealing from
him material facts as to the situation and extent of the prem
ises, 40 O. S. 168; 15 O. S. 145. In an action to foreclose a mort
gage given to secure the purchase money on a purchase of the
business and good will of a firm, breach of the contract of sale
by injury to the good will may be set up by way of counter
claim, 36 O. S. 261. In an action to foreclose a mortgage for
purchase money, defendant may deduct the amount of an ua*

paid assessment, 30 O. S. 550; bat on foreclosure a mortiovo,r in
possession can not counterclaim for defect in morunun-e'ii title.
6 O. S. 207.
Partnership. In an action against partners, a several claim in
favor of one defendant only can not be enforced as a counter
claim, 4 Duer. 469, and a demand against the members of a firm
can not be set up as a counterclaim in an action by a member
of such firm for a demand due him individually, 19 Barb. 196;
but a debt due to one as surviving partner may be set off against
a demand on him in his own right, and pfeetvm, 10 O. 455 ; 2
Bull 253.
Real property In an action upon a note given for a farm, de
fendant may counterclaim damages for the improper removal
after the sale of growing crops, 49 Mo. 570. Defendant in eject
ment was allowed: to set up the value of improvements against a
claim for mesne profits, 30 Wis. 308. In such action tacts show
ing that an equitable title is in the defendant, and that the
plaintifff's legal title was wrongfully obtained, and should inure
to the defendant, are the subjects of counterclaim, 58 Wis. 237.
In an action for the possession of land founded upon the legal
title held by the plaintifff, the defendant may set up at a counter
claim that he is equitably the owner of the land, and demand
a specific performance or conveyance, 57 N. Y. 508. Fraud in
the consideration of a deed may be set up as a counter
claim, 2 D. 604. A vendee who is induced to purchase land
through the fraudulent representations of the vendor can
counterclaim damages therefore in an action for the purchase
money, 32 la. 437, and vendee may counterclaim for untrue
representations, though honestly made, 39 O. S. 491. In a suit
by a grantor to cancel a conveyance for fraud, a counterclaim
denying the fraud and alleging that the plaintifff wrongfully
kept the defendant out of possession, and asking judgment for
possession and for rents and pronto, is admissible, 27 lnd. 4. In
an action for partition, the respective claims and rights of the
parties may be put in issue and determined, and for that pur
pose a counterclaim may be filed, 87 lnd. 123. In an action by
a tenant in common for an undivided half of a parcel of land,
defendant may set up a parol partition and occupancy under it,
and ask judgment that the plaintifff release, 28 Wis. 678. Where,
in partition proceedings, a parcener elects to take the property,
and a deed is made to him by order of court, and he omits to
have the taxes discharged before taking the title, and he or his
vendee has to pay them, such payment of taxes can not be set
up as a lieu and recouped against notes and mortgage given for
the deferred payments In the partition proceedings, 2 Bull 281.
in an action upon a bond given for the purchase money of land, the
defendant may counterclaim damuges forthe removal and con
version of fixtures without his knowledge after the contract was
made, but before the formal transfer of the land and execution
of the bond, 20 Mo. 433. In an action for purchase money, the
defendant may set up as a counterclaim a breach of the cove
nant of seizin, 12 Kas. 85. In an action to recover the balance
of purchase money claimed to be due for land sold, the defend
ant may counterclaim damages for the non-delivery of posses
sion at the time agreed, and for the removal of certain fixtures
which, by the terms of the agreement, were purchased with the
property, 47 N. Y. 426. In an action to recover the purchase money
on breach of a contract to convey, a subsequent depreciation in
the value of the land can not be pleaded as a counterclaim, 77
Ind. 479. A grantee of land can not recoup in a suit for the
balance of the purchase money, damages claimed because cer
tain streets upon which the property was described as abutting
were obstructed by another ana prior grantee of the grantor, 2
H. 86. Defect of title without eviction is not a good counter
claim to an action on a note for purchase money, 6 O. S. 525 ; but
an encumbrance on the land may be set up even against a transferee of the note without indorsement, 11 O. S. 616. A counter
claim for breach of covenant against encumbrance is defeated
by proof that defendant, the vendee, agreed to pay off the in
cumbrance, 27 O. S. 285. Under § 5780, in an action by the ven
dor for purchase money, a third person holding an outstanding
title must be made defendant before the defense becomes avail
able, 28 O. S. 39. The right to bring in such third person exists
only where there has been a breach of the covenants in the
deed, 35 O. S. 289. In a suit for possession and to quiet title, the
defendant may, by way of counterclaim, set up a title in equity
in himself and pray to have his title quieted, 91 Ind. 301. In an
action to quiet title, an answer averring possession by a valid
tax sale and asking affirmative relief was held to present a good'
counterclaim, 19 Wis. 74. In an action to restrain waste and for
recovery of damages for waste already done to the freehold, de
fendant may, by way of counterclaim, demand the specific
performance of a contract to convey, 11 Abb. N. C. 93; but a
demand of damages for waste is not incident to the recovery of
the possession of land, and can not be-properly joined in such
counterclaim, 27 Ind. 4. Counter-claim for damages sustained
by waste on land without the state not allowed, 88 N. Y. 258.
Replevin. In replevin by a mortgagee of chattels against an
officer holding property under an attachment, the attachment
creditor substituted for the officer may, by counterclaim, set up
his right to relief, 20 O. S. 38. In replevin for a horse sold by
defendant to plaintifff in exchange for land, defendant may
counterclaim deceit as to the land, 66 N. C. 233.
Sales. In an action to recover for the price of goods sold, or
on a note given therefore, defendant may counterclaim for dam
ages sustained by fraud in the sale or breach of warranty, 57
N.Y. 16; 39O. S. 671; 7 O. S. 95; 26 O. S. 537 ; 9 W. L. J. 187; 4
O. S. 680, as for a defect of quality or quantity, 26 O. S. 537 ; 3
Rec. 352. In an action by the buyer of goods against the seller
for not completing the contract, the latter may counterclaim
the price of goods already delivered, 52 Barb. 132. In an action
on a contract for goods sold, defendant may counterclaim a
judgment recovered by him against the plaintifff before the suit
brought by the latter was commenced, 29 Barb. 295. In an action
for goods, or to restrain their sale, defendant may show prop
erty in the goods, and by counterclaim recover damages for the
plaintifff's interference, 29 N. Y. 494. In an action for the price
of goods, a counterclaim for damages for failure to deliver,
which shows that delivery and payment were concurrent con
ditions, must also aver an offer or readiness to pay, otherwise itdoes not state facts sufficient to constitute a counterclaim, 29
O. S. 362.
Services. In an action for services, where plaintifff has been
discharged before the end of the term, a claim ior damages for negligent and unskillful work, is a valid counterclaim, 12 O. S.
344; and in an action to recover wages, damages caused br plain
tifTs leaving the service before the end of the term of employ
ment may be interposed by way of counterclaim, 4 Met. (Ky.)464;
in an action by a mechanic, a claim for material converted by
plaintifff, 63 Barb. 500. In an action against an attorney at law
for monies received by him as such, he may counterclaim lor
services rendered, 53 How. Pr. 278. lu an action against an em
ployee for converting the employer's property, the former may
counterclaim for unpaid wages, 72 N. C. 541. In an action for
work and labor performed, a counterclaim for failing and
refusing fo abide by an award of arbitrators is not good, 51
Ind. 187.
Stockhotder's individual liability is not a good counterclaim
in his action against the corporation, 6 Bull 428. A stockholder
in a building company, sued upon his personal liability, may
set up a counterclaim for advances made or liabilities incurred
on behalf of the company, 11 Abb. Pr. 278. In an action by a
railroad company for a subscription to its stock, defendant was
allowed to counterclaim damages for a right of way through
his farm, the plaintifff having agreed that the damages should
go in discharge of his subscription, 18 B. Mon. 735.
Suretyship. A surety, sued upon his obligation, can not
avail himself of a counterclaim in favor of his principal,
against the plaintifff, 22 Hun 434; 55 N. Y. 619. In an action
against principal and sureties to recover upon an undertak
ing, a debt due from the plaintifff or his assignor to the prin
cipal can not be interposed as a counterclaim at law, 80
N. Y. 560. In an action by a surety against a co-surcty for
contribution, the latter can not interpose as a counterclaim
an indebtedness of the plaintifff to the principal, 57 N. Y. 649;
and in an action against a guarantor of bonds, where the
principal is not joined as defendant, a cause of action against
the principal only can not be interposed as a counterclaim, 15
Abb. Pr. n. s. 144.
Tort. In an action on contract, a cause of action founded
purely in tort, and not arising out of the transaction mentioned
in the petition, can not be set up as a counterclaim, 66 How. Pr.
385; but a case of tort which the law permits the injured party
to waive and sue, as on an implied contract, may be set up as a
counterclaim, 66 Barb. 169.
Usury is not ordinarily the proper subject of counterclaim,
81 N. Y. 16 ; 133 Mass. 248; 98 Pa. St. 65, and can not be pleaded
in an action by au assignee of a note, 4 Met. (Ky.) 58. It has
been held, however, that defendant may counterclaim for usu
rious interest paid, 16 O.S. 417, when usury arises out of the
same transaction, 23 Wis. 184 ; but a claim that usurious interest
was paid by the defendant to the plaintifff in previous transac
tions is not a good counterclaim, 1 D. 18, 20.
§ 5073. Costs not recoverable in subsequent suit on
counterclaim or set-off. If a defendant omit to set up a
counterclaim or set-off, he can not recover costs against
the plaintifff in any subsequent action thereon ; but
this section shall not apply to causes of action which
are stricken out of or withdrawn from the answer, as provided in $ 5074 and 5089. [51 v. 57, I 95; a A
C. 979.]
2 C. S. C. R. 249; see 12 O. S. 621.
§ 5074. New party to be made if necessary. When it
appears that a new party is necessary to a final decision
upon the counterclaim, the court may either permit the
new party to be made by a summons to answer the
counterclaim, or may direct the counterclaim to be
stricken out of the answer, and made the subject of a
separate action. [51 v. 57, \ 96 ; S. & C. 980.]
20 O. S. 38 ; 39 O. S. 141 ; 40 O. S. 408 ; 10 Bull 367, 371.
§ 5075. Set-off. A set-off can only be pleaded in an
action founded on contract, and must be a cause of ac
tion arising upon contract, or ascertained by the decis
ion of a court. [51 v. 57, § 97 ; S. & C. 980.]
The right of set-off depends upon statute, 1 H. 388. The code
does not introduce any new rules as to the right of set-off, Id.;
and the rules under the code are substantially the same as
before its adoption, 1 D. 564. The right can be asserted when
the cross-demands exist, in a perfect condition, between the
same parties at the same time and in the same right, 1 C. C. K,
98, 100 ; but the code especially provides thatsuch right shall not
be defeated or impaired by assignment, 4993, 5077. If, there
fore, the holder of such a claim, already due and payable, assign
the same, and the debtor at the time of this transfer holds a
similar claim against the assignor, which is also then due and
E&yable, he may set off his debt against the demand in the
andsof the assignee, Pomeroy Rem. \ 163; 31 O. S. 231. If, how
ever, the assignment is made before the opposing demand
becomes mature, and the latter does not thus become actually
due and payable until after the transfer, the debtor's right of
set-off is defeated by the assignment, Id.; 27 O. S. 355. But if an
insotvent holder of a claim not yet matured assigns the same
before matuiity, and the debtor at the time of this transfer
holds a similar claim against the assignor, which is then due
and payable, his right of set-off against the assignee, when the
latter's cause of action arises, is preserved and protected, Pomeroy Rem. § 163 ; see 34 O. S. 381 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 33 ; 26 O. S. 567.
Account. A balance of an account may be the subject of set
off. 1 C. S. C. R. 259, as a balance of an unsettled partnership ac
count. 26 O. S. 567; but if the items of the account have been
mergetUti a judgment, they are not the subject of set-off, though
the suit thereon was brought and judgment recovered after such
cause was pending, 17 O. 156.
Assignment does not defeat an existing right, 31 O. S. 231, but
defeats one not due, 27 O. S. 355. Assignment of guaranty of
note before due defeats set-off, 8 Rec. 365. Debts of assignor due
after assignment can not be set off against assignee, 1 H. 388; 11
O. S. 616. Assignee of judgment can not set it off against his
creditor, 24 O. 8, 204.
BUU and notes. Deposit in bank can not be set off against note of depositor. 16 O. S. 296 ; 13 Id. 495. Indorser can not set off his
liability against maker of note, 4 O. S. 586. Breach of payee's
agreement can not be set off against assignee of notes, 2 Ball
304%; 6 Rec. 238. A note transferred by the holder after it Is
due is not the subject of set-off against the assignor, 34 O. S. 158 ;
but the maker of a separate note in suit who holds an overdue
joint note made by the plaintifff and another, who are both In
solvent, may in equity set off the joint demand, 41 O. S. 403.
Damages for a tort can not be set off, 6 Rec. 380: 2 Bull 262:
but in an action founded on coutract, unliquidated damages
may be the subject of setoff, 40 O. S. 186 ; 10 Rec. 306 ; 35 Kas. 93 ;
Inci. Rev. Stat, § 348; see 27 O. S. 355, 358; contra, 1 H. 434 ; 8 Bull
35; 3 Neb. 161; 2 Met. (Ky.) 143.
Executors and administrators. In a suit by an administrator
upon a claim of the intestate, defendant may set off any de
mand of his against the intestate, 6 O. 35; but claims originating
after death can not be set off against the estate, Id.; and claims
for or against the estate, originating after death, and those origi
nating before, can not be set off against each other, W. 163 ; 20
O. 185. Set-off by executor against distributee not determinable
in order of distribution, 32 O. S. 532 ; see 3 C. C. R. 479.
Foreclosure. Set-off may be allowed in foreclosure where a
personal judgment is demanded, 51 N. Y. 555, but not if the
action is for foreclosure merely, 17 Abb. Pr. 159.
Joint and separate claims cau not be set off against each other
unless equity requires it, 1 C. S. C. R, 435 ; 34 O. S. 381 ; 2 Bull 253.
Joint purchasers can not set off a debt due to one of them
from the seller unless one is surety, 2 Clev. R. 219; but in case of
insolvency, joint may be set off against separate debts, 41 O. 8,
403.
Judgments may be set off against each other on motion or
in equity, 1 P. 168; W. 292: 15 O. 148 ; 4 O. 90; 41 O. S. 403. A
bond to two can not set off against a judgment against oue, 1
Bull 283. When judgments are set off against each other, attor
neys' fees are to be regarded, 37 O. S. 403.
Partners. A set-off ma y be allowed between partners, 2 O. 320.
A creditor of a partner may set off bis debt due the firm, but
which had been assigned to the partner, 19 O. 126. Firm debts
may be set off in au action by a surviving partner, 10 O. 455.
Where a firm is sued and one member only is served he can not
set oft a claim due him individually, 2 Bull 253 ; 6 Rec. 337.
Receicer. A set-off may be pleaded in an action by a receiver,
31 O. S. 231 ; see 20 Bull 465 ; 21 Id. 136 ; 1 C. C. R. 524.
Stockholder can not set off his claim against a corporation
against his liability as stockholder, 15 Bull 164. Subscriber for
stock in action for subscription can not set up payment of com
pany's debts, made after suit, 3 O. S. 459 ; see 20 Bull 465 ; 21 Id.
193.
Suretyship. In an action on a joint debt against a principal
and surety, a debt due from the plaintifff to the principal alone,
may be set-off, 22 O. S. 297. A surety may set off a debt paid for
principal against debt due the estate of principal, W. 168, but
not if paid after his death, 6 O. 35.
Usurious interest, under U. S. banking act 1864, can not be
set off, 31 0. S. 321. When the claim is on a usurious note, and
the defense is usury, with a counterclaim for overpayment by
mistake, plaintifff can not prove by way of set-off that the de
fendant is indebted to him on distinct transactions, 16 O. S. 417.
What are not the subjects of set-off. County orders can not be
set off against bond of collector, 2 O. 106; nor can contingent
liabilities be made the subjects of set-off, 4 O. 354 ; 4 O. S. 586;
nor part of a claim for unliquidated damages under justice's
code, 12 O. S. 344; nor a libel against a libel, W. 681; nor right
to remove fixtures against mesne profits, 8 O. 401 ; nor claims
conditionally assigned for purposes of setoff, 5 0. S. 59; nor
damages for a tort, 6 Rec 380 ; 2 Bull 262; nor in action on res
titution bond the claim on which the original action was
brought. 31 O. S. 28; nor mayor'!) uncollected costs against col
lected fines, etc., 1 C. C. R. 340.
Miscellaneous. Set-off can not be set up in reply, except to a
cross-petition, 1 C. S. C. R. 259; 16 O. S, 417. Cause not jomable
with that in petition can not be set up in reply, 1 C. S. C. R. 259.
Anawer, instead of demurrer, waives objection to set-off, 1 H.
434. Estoppel may be plead against party from making set-off
in violation of his agreement, 19 O. S. 356 ; 15 O. S. 148. Leave
may be given to withdraw, 16 O. S. 417. It is governed by tex
fori, 31 O. S. 168. The statute of limitations ceases to run against
a set-off from the date of the commencement of the action in
which it is pleaded, S6 O. S. 152. Bills and notes, 3 C. C. R. 94.
§ 6076. Id. New party to be made if necessary. If a
new party be necessary to a final decision upon the set
off, the court shall permit the new party to be made, if,
owing to the insolvency or non-residence of the plaintifff,
or other cause, the defendant will be in danger of losing
his claim unless permitted to use it as a sel-ofl'. [51 v.
57, ? 98 : S. & C. 981.]
§ 5077, When cross-demands to be deemed compen
sated. When cross-demands have existed between per
sons, under such circumstances that if one had brought
an action against the other a counterclaim or set-off
could have been set up, neither can be deprived of the
benefit thereof by assignment by the other, or by his
death, but the two demands must be deemed compen
sated, so far as they equal each other. [51 v. 57, ? 99 ;
S. & C. 981.]
Pomeroy Rem. \\ 162, 163; 14 Kas. 504 ; 3 C. C. R. 94.
§ 5078. Answer of guardian and attorney. The guard
ian of an infant, or of a person of unsound mind, or an
attorney for a person in prison, shall deny in the answer
all material allegations of the petition prejudicial to such
defendant. [51 v. 57, ? 100 ; S. & C. 981.]
17 O. S. 262, 484. 503 ; 23 O. S. 520 ; 8 O. 377.
SUBDIVISION V. REPLY.
§ 5079. Boply. Contents. When the answer contains
new matter, the plaintifff may reply to such new matter, denying generally or specifically each allegation contro
verted by him ; and he may also allege, in ordinary and
concise language, any new matter, not inconsistent with
the petition, constituting an answer to such new matter in
the answer. [54 v. 92, \ 101 ; S. & C. 981.]
Amendment of reply, when argument begun, not allowed in, 4
Bull 848; S. C. 8 Rec. 306.
Default for reply removed at discretion of court, 2 ( lev. R. 97 ;
7 Bull 301.
Demurrer to reply. Defendant may demur to the reply, or to
a separate traverse or avoidance of a defense or counterclaim
contained in the reply, on the ground that it is insufficient in
law upon its face, § 5067 : but ifa reply of new matter U not suf
ficient to avoid a defense, failure to demur does not waive the
right to object to its sufficiency, 31 O. S. 492.
Departure. It is a rule of pleading that the reply can not con
tradict the petition, 18 O. S. 262. PIaintiff is entitled to recover
only on the causes of action set out in his petition, and if he
seeks to introduce new causes of action in his reply it is a
departure, 16 O. S. 533; 1 C. C. R. 64, 67 s. c'. 14 Bull 55, 56. If
there la an inconsistency between the reply and the case made
in the petition it is a departure, advantage of which may be
taken by demurrer, 1 O. S. C. R. 12; 2 Id. 80; as where the |,etitlon alleges a direct undertaking and the reply charges a guar
anty only, 4 Mo. App. 470; where the petition alleges a com
mittal and the reply alleges a discharge without committal, 1
C. S. C. R. 12 ; where the petition sets up a right as an individ
ual to sue and the reply a fiduciary one as trustee, 2 C. S. 0. R.
80. Where the answer denies the contract sued on and sets up a
different one, and the reply pleads performance of the latter and
asks judgment on it, the issue raised on the second contract is
immaterial, 5 Rec. 372. But it is not a departure to allege addi
tional facts avoiding a defense, and new matter not inconsistent
with the petition may be set up in reply to new matter in the
answer, 37 O. S. 344. Where the petition alleged ownership of
stock in the plaintifff and the reply set up a special ownership
as pledgee, this was held not a departure, the action being for
damages against a corporation for refusing to transfer the stock
on its books, 6 Mo. App. 45i. Where an answer to a petition for
an account sets up an award, it is not a departure in the reply
to ask judgment for the amount so awarded, Si O. S. 294. Re
fusal to strike out such matter is not good ground for setting
aside the judgment, 1 C. S. C. R. 555. A departure is cured by
verdict, 5 O. 88.
Form. A reply must be distinct and specific so that it may be
clearly seen wnat is contradicted. 19 Abb. Pr. 288. An aver
ment in the reply, that the pleader can not admit or deny the
allegations of the answer, but demands proof of the same, is no
traverse of the facts so alleged, and the defendant in such case
will not be called on to adduce proof of the truth of his aver
ments, 43 O. S. 427. A reply denying that anything is due the
adverse party is a statement of a mere legal conclusion, and has
no legal effect, 18 O. S. 353 ; and where the answer sets up the
statute of frauds as a defense, averring that the supposed prom
ises sued on were Jiot evidenced by any writing, a reply denying that the promises were within the statute is a statement of a mere
legal conclusion, 87 O. S. 408. The denial must be of all or any
part. A denial by negative pregnant is insufficient, 29 O. S. 899.
A reply is not necessary where the answer contains only a gen
eral denial, 24 O. S. 345 ; where the answer denies that defend
ant committed the act charged, and alleges that it was commit
ted by a third person, 15 O. S. 212 ; when the allegations of the
answer are merely conclusions of law, 5 Minn. 302; where the
answer sets up a different contract from that alleged in the peti
tion, 35 O. S. 104; where the answer consists of argumentative
denials, 9 Rec. 43 ; 5 Bull 523 ; where the answer purports to
admit a certain fact not stated in the petition, 22 Kas. 110;
where the new matter set up in the answer amounts to a denial,
37 O. S. 49; 4 Bull 986; where facts are stated in the answer
which could have been given in evidence under a denial of the
averments in the petition, 25 O. S. 134.
A reply is necessary in assault and battery under a plea of metliter manus imposuit to admit of proof of excessive force, 2 A. L.
Reg. 403. Payment is such new matter as requires a reply, 25
O. S. 276. In quo warranto new matter set up in the answer must
be replied to, 25 O. S. 279. Res adjudicata must be specially
pleaded in reply to new matter in the answer, 44 O. S. 253 ; 37
O. S. 344. Set-off to a counterclaim can be pleaded in the reply,
1 C. S. C. R. 259. In an action for damages for entering plaint
iff's premises and taking away certain personal property, defend
ant pleaded a license under the conditions of a chattel mortgage,
and a reply averring that the mortgage and notes secured thereby
had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation and without
consideration was held good on demurrer, 1 Clev. R. 210. A
reply of settlement to a plea of usury is bad, 40 O. S. 630.
Waiver. Where the facts alleged by way of defense In the
answer are not denied in the reply, and the case proceeds to trial
upon the evidence as if such facts were denied without objec
tion or exception until after the judgment of the court of com
mon pleas has been affirmed by the district court, the judgment
will not be reversed on the ground that the answer was not de
nied in the reply, 27 O. S. 592. If no reply is filed to an answer
of new matter constituting a defense, but the cause is tried with
out objection as though such allegations had been denied, a
demand for judgment on the pleadings after each party has in
troduced his evidence is too late, 39 O. S. 614.
SUBDIVISION VI. GENERAL RULES.
§ 5080. Pleading to answer asking relief. When in
an answer affirmative relief is demanded against a codefendant, such co-defendant may demur or answer
thereto, as if it were a petition ; and to such answer of
the co-defendant a demurrer or reply may be filed as in
other cases.
5 Kas. 396.
§ 5081. What allegations are deemed to be true and
what denied. Every material allegation of the petition
not controverted by the answer, and every material alle
H .5082-5083
gatiou of new matter in the answer not controverted by
the reply, shall, for the purposes of the action, be taken
as true ; but the allegation of new matter in the reply
shall be deemed controverted by the adverse party, at
upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may re
quire ; and allegations of value, or of amount of damage,
shall not be considered as true, by failure to controvert
them. [54 v. 92, \ 127 ; S. & C. 987.]
See §5070 ; 9 O. S. 44.
§ 5083. What is a material allegation. A material
allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim or
defense, which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient. [51 v. 57, { 128; S. & C.
987.]
28 O. S. 418.
§ 5083. Presumptions of law, eta. Neither presump
tions of law, nor matters of which judicial notice is taken,
need be stated in the pleading. [51 v. 57, 1 129 ; S. & C.
987.]
The courts will take judicial notice of the seals of foreign
states, 17 O. S. 463 ; of judges and terms of court, but not of the
length of terms, 2 O. S. 223 ; 6 O. 336 ; 28 O. S. 551 ; of public laws
of the state, or of the United States, 11 O. 276: of general and
local laws, W. 722; 2 0. S. C. R. 178 ; of acts of Incorporation. 11
O. 276 ; of canal laws of the state, W. 662 ; public officers. 32 Tex.
570: the signatures of officers of state, 22 Mich. 461 ; matters of
public history of the country, 37 N. Y. 174, but not of a particu
lar city, 1 O. 189; of winds and weather, W. 113; of permanent
geographical features of the state, or of the country, 40 N. H.
420; of matters of science or art, 52 Ala. lift; 91 U.S. 37; treaties
and proclamations, 9 How. 127; 16 Minn. 525. A court will take
judicial notice of its own records, 16 Kas. 475 ; of its officers and
their signatures. 66 Barb. 91 ; 1 Mich. 22' ; 14 la. 455. Courts
will not take judicial notice of the law of another state, 32 O. S.
163 ; nor of a special charter, 33 O. S. 384 ; nor of the population
of a city by any particular census, 35 O. S. 119; nor of the con
tents of journals of the houses of the legislature, 3 O. S. 309 ; nor
of the different names of a river, 29 O. S. 238; nor of the ordi
nances of a municipal corporation. 69 N. Y. 250 (butacts creating
municipal corporation1! are public acts of which the courts will
take judicial notice, 7 Kas. 42B; 72 Ala. 411); nor of the usages of
trade established by a particular board, 46 Cal. 209 ; nor of the
customs of mining districts, 2 Colo. 424.
Presumptions of law need not be pleaded, as that a statute was
properly enacted, 7O. S. 383; that a corporate seal affixed to a deed
was affixed by the proper authority, 17 O. S. 571 ; that official
acts were rightly done, 27 O. S. 311 ; presumptions of innocence,
12 O. S. 433 ; of coercion of wife by husband, 34 O. S. 127 ; of death
from seven years absence, 33 O. S. 155; of legitimacy from being
5084. Substitution of copies for lost pleadings, etc.
'Whenever a pleading, process, return, report, verdict,
bill of exceptions, order, entry, or other act, file or pro
ceeding, in any action or proceeding pending in any
court of this state, shall have been lost or destroyed, or
is withheld by any person, such court may, upon the ap
plication of any party to such action or proceeding, order
a copy or substantial copy thereof to be substituted.
[81 v. 160; 51 v. 57, § 130; S. & C. 987.]
This section by 83 v. 207, is made applicable to justices' and
mayors' courts. The substitution of copies of lost pleadings
does not require notice to the opposite party, 12 Bull 184. If the
pleadings are not on 6le the court can not compel the defendant
to go to trial without ordering them replaced or supplied, W. 368.
PIeadings can not be dispensed with by agreement, W. 524, ex
cept in those cases provided for the submission of an agreed
case without action, 30 O. S. 120 ; but where the parties proceeded
to trial without pleadings, no objection being taken, and there
was a verdict and judgment, such irregularity was held not to
be sufficient ground for reversal of the judgment on error, 11
O. S. 692.
§ 5085. When oopies to be filed. When the action,
counterclaim, or set-off is founded on an account, or on
a written instrument as evidence of indebtedness, a copy
thereof must be attached to and filed with the plead
ing (1); and if not so attached and filed, the reason for
the omission must be stated in the pleading (2). [51 v.
57, §117; S. &C. 984.]
1, 2 H. 165; 12 O. S. 66. It is not good practice to copy the
written instrument in the pleading, 27 O. S. 421. The copy at
tached and filed with the petition forms nopart of the pleading,
29 O. S. 13; but where a copy of a policy of fire insurance filed
with the petition was treated as part of it without objection, it
was held not error in the reviewing court to treat the policy as
part of the petition, 35 O. S. 606. In n suit on a foreign judgment,
the transcript of the record should be attached to the petition,
2 H. 163, 165 ; 2 Rec. 392 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 29 ; Id. 134 ; contra, 2 D. 210;
but not a city ordinance, 1 1). 479 ; and the transcript of a former
decree for alimony attached to the petition, and marked "A,"
can not be considered in construing such petition, and will not
in any sense supply the place of the direct and positive aver
ments of the facts relied on, 43 O. S. 499. 2. And the sufficiency
of the reason for the omission is to be decided by the court, and
does not affect the merits of the action, 29 O. S. 13. The loss or
destruction of the instrument is a sufficient excuse for the
omission, 32 O. S. 449 ; 10 Neb. 524 ; and if the instrument is in
the defendant's possession and he refuses to surrender it, 29 O. S.
13, but the fact that a note is held by a third party is not a good
reason for the omission to file it with the pleading, 38 Mo. 224.
The omission to attach a copy is not ground of demurrer, 13
O. S. 66. The Irregularity is reached by motion. Id.; 13 Kas. 351 ;
8 Neb. 211. The omission may be waived if not objected to,
33 O. S. 308, and is not ground for reversal if not objected to be
low, Id.
§ 5086. Pleading in action on acoonnt, ete. In an
action, counterclaim, or set-off founded upon an account,
or upon an instrument for the unconditional payment of
money only, it shall be sufficient for a party to set forth a
copy of the account or instrument, with all credits and
the indorsements thereon, and to state that there is due
to him, on such account or instrument, from the adverse
party, a specified sum, which he claims, with interest;
and when others than the makers of a promissory note,
or the acceptors of a bill of exchange, are parties, it
shall be necessary to state the facts which fix their lia
bility. [51 v. 57, § 122; S. & C. 984.]
To constitute "an account," within the meaning of this sec
tion, it is not necessary that the items be entered in an account
book, provided they usually form the subject of book accounts,
12 0. S. 621. A petition on a book account, in the short form
authorized by this section, is good as against a general demurrer,
when the account attached to the petition consists of one or
more items which are the proper subjects of a book account,
and of other cash items which are not ordinarily the subjects of
such account, 1 C. C. R. 23; 13 Bull 295. In an action on a
promissory note, when the petition is in the form prescribed by
this section, whether the plaintifff be an original party to the
note or not, the extrinsic facts which show his right or title
need not be expressly averred, 32 O. S. 449. A transcript of a
judgment is not an instrument for the unconditional payment
of money only, which may be made part of the petition by
reference", 2 H. 163; nor are city ordinances and resolutions of
the city council, 1 D. 479 ; and where the substance of an appeal
bond was not set out in the petition, but a copy was annexed,
and referred to as if incorporated in the petition, the instru
ment not being for the unconditional payment of money, it
was held inadmissible under this section, 11 O. S. 398-408. A
person other than the payee who brings an action against the
maker of a note, payable to the order of the payee, and frames
his petition under this section, without giving a copy of an
indorsement by the payee, is not entitled under such petition
to the protection given to a bona fide indorsee for value before
maturity, although the note when offered in evidence appears
with the name of the payee indorsed thereon, 31 O. S. 193.
Where a payee, on transferring the note, writes over the indorse
ment a guarantee of payment at maturity, he is a party to the
note within the meaning of this section, 26 O. S. 330. An action
to foreclose a mortgage given to secure the amount due upon a
bond, and for the sale of mortgaged premises, is not an action
upon an instrument for the payment of money only, and plead
ing by copy is not, thereforee, allowable in such case, 7 Hun 300.
And an agreement of separation between husband and wife,
which contains a stipulation for the payment to a trustee of a
sum for the wife's support, is not an instrument for the pay
ment of money only within the meaning of the section, 7 Abb.
n. c. 256. It is a sufficient "giving of an account" to set down
in writing, in the form of an account, the items thereof, and
file it with the petition, without having previously made any
entries in an account book, 12 O. S. 621. An allegation of the
amount due is a material allegation, which must be contro
verted by answer, or judgment by default may be rendered
without proof, 25 O. S. 635, 638. The account annexed must be spe
cific. A general statement by which several distinct claims are
grouped together is not sufficient. The account must be as
specific as the bill of particulars under the old pleading, 1 H.
559, otherwise the objection is properly taken by demurrer, Id.;
but where the copy is imperfect, it is held the remedy is by a
demand of a bill of particulars under § 5292, 2 D. 499.
§ 5087. Sedundant and irrelevant matter, etc, to be
strleken out. If redundant, irrelevant, or scurrilous
matter be inserted in a pleading, it may be stricken
out on the motion of the party prejudiced thereby;
and obscene words may be stricken from a pleading on
the motion of a party, or by the court of its own mo
tion. [61 v. 57, U18 ; S. & C. 984.]
The terms "redundant" and "irrelevant" are not equiva
lent, for although matter which is irrelevant is also redundant,
the converse is not true, 5 Sand. 657. A needless repetition
of material averments is redundancy, although the facts averred,
so far from being irrelevant, may constitute the whole cause of
action, Id. Matter in a pleading is irrelevant which has no
bearing on the question in dispute, does not affect the subject
matter of the controversy, and can in no way affect or assist the
decision of the court, 53 Barb. 650; 17 Abb. Pr. 1%. The term
"irrelevancy" comprehends both prolixity on needless details
of material matter and also matter out of which no cause of
action or defense could arise between the parties, 7 Bosw. 664 ;
11 Abb. Pr. 435. The remedy for these defects is by motion and
not by demurrer, 1 H. 40; 6 O. S. 607; 1 Bull 314. The court
has inherent power to strike out scandalous and impertinent
matter, 17 Abb. Pr. 188; and since the responsibility of such
matter rests upon the attorney preparing the pleading, he
should be charged with the payment of the costs of the motion
to strike out, 8 Hun 522 ; but a motion to strike out such matter
from the petition will not be considered after answer or de
murrer. 21 How. Pr. 234, or even after an order for time to
plead, 86 N. C. 4.
§ 5088. Allegations of pleading to be made more defi
nite, eto. When the allegations of a pleading are bo
indefinite and uncertain that the precise nature of the
charge or defense is not apparent, the court may require the pleading to be made more definite and certain by
amendment. [51 v. 57, 1 1 18 ; S. & C. 984.]
The remedy is by motion and not liy demurrer, IO.S. JStt, 29S ;
as where facts are stated on information and belief and not
positively. 13 O. S. 228; where an answer denies all the matrrial
allegations of a petition. 10 O. S. 451 (but an objection to in
sufficiency in matter of substance should be taken by demurrer,
10 O. S. 501). An objection to the form in which facts are staled
in an alternative writ of mandamus, 23 O. S. 335; and an objec
tion that the petition of plaintifff, who sued as receiver upon a
promissory note, did not sufficiently show his title, 29 O. e. 419,
are raised by motion to make more definite, ete.; nee 46 O. S. 44.
§ 5089. Counter-claim or set-of may be made the sub
ject of a separate action. The court, at any time before
the final submission of the cause, may, on motion of
the defendant, allow a counterclaim or iet-off to be
withdrawn, and the same may become the subject of
another action ; on motion of either party, to be made
at the time such counterclaim or set off is withdrawn,
an action on the same shall be docketed and proceeded
in without process, and the court shall direct the time
and manner of pleading therein ; and if an action be
not so docketed, suit may be brought as in other cases.
[51 v. 57, §119; S. & C. 984.]
2 C. S. C. R. 258.
§ 5090. Pleading a judgment. In pleading a judg
ment, or other determination of a court, or of an officer
of special jurisdiction, it shall be sufficient to state that
such judgment or determination was duly given or
made; and if such allegation be controverted, the party
pleading must establish on the trial the facta conferring
jurisdiction. [51 v. 57, § 120 ; S. <& C. 984.]
The provisions of this section are confined to judgments of
inferior tribunals, 2 C. S. C. R. 29, and are not intended to apply to
judgments of superior courts of general jurisdiction, or judg
ments of courts of sister states. Id.; 2 H. 163; see 61 How. Pr.
272; 10 How. Pr. 532. It must be averred that the judgment was
"duly given or made," 13 How. Pr. 538. An averment that a
"judgment was rendered " is not an averment that i t was "duly
given or made," nor its equivalent, and is not sufficient under
ibis section, 52 Cal. 407 ; nor is it sufficient simply to allege that
" a judgment was entered," 13 How. Pr. 538.
§ 5091. Conditions precedent, how pleaded. In pleadi ng the performance of conditions precedent in a con
tract, it shall be sufficient to state that the party duly
performed all the conditions on his part ; and if such,
allegation be controverted, the party pleading must
establish, on the trial, the facts showing such perform
ance. [51 v. 57, 1 121 ; S. & C. 984.]
A general allegation of performance is sufficient. 1 H. 239 ; 27
O. S. 421 ; 3:1 O. B. 555, as in pleading a condition on a policy of
insurance, it is sufficient to aver that "plaintifff has performed
ull the conditions on his part to be performed," 33 O. S. 555, and
if the petition does not allege performance of such condition
or a waiver of performance ou the part of the insurer, it is bad
on demurrer, 26 O. S. 348; so, in an action on a note, averments
that payment "was duly demanded at maturity," and that it
" was duly protested for non-payment," and that " notice thereof
was duly given," are sufficient averments of the performance of
conditions precedent, 13 Wis. 277. It is sufficient to allege the
performance of the condition in the language of the condition,
16 Gratt. 295; but an allegation that a contract " has been a valid
and subsisting contract ever since the date of its execution,
and is still a valid and subsisting contract, and binding on the
said
," is not sufficient, 14 O. S. 308. This mode of plead
ing is confined to conditions on contract, 52 Cal. 350, and includes
as well express conditions precedent as constructive and implied
conditions, 27 O. S. 424 ; 3 W. L. M. 628.
§ 5092. Pleading private statutes. In pleading a pri
vate statute, or a right derived therefrom, it shall be
sufficient to refer to such statute by its title, and the day
of its passage. [51 v. 57, § 123 ; S. & C. 984.]
Courts can not take judicial notice of private statutes, unless
specially pleaded, 33 O. S. 384 : contra, 11 O. 276 ; 2 C. S. C. K. 1 78 ;
and in pleading such statutes, they must at least be referred to
by their title and the day of their passage, 33 O. S. 384. A city
ordinance must be specially pleaded. 69 N. Y. 250; 4 Bush. 440 ;
and a mere reference to it by number and date, it is held, is
not sufficient, 9 Oreg. 303; but a city court may properly take
judicial notice of a city ordinance, 11 la. 407. A foreign statute,
26 O. S. 131 ; 40 O. S. 342, or the statute of another state must be
specially pleaded, 32 O.S. 103, or the charter of a foreign corpora
tion, 22 O. S. 159. It is the safest course, when pleading a statute
sanctioning a defense, to follow the words of the statute, 10 How.
Pr. 515. Public domestic statutes need not be set out or even
referred to in the pleading since the courts will take judicial
notice of their existence and terms, 15 Wend. 111.
§ 5093. Libel and slander. In an action for a libel or
slander, it shall be sufficient to state, generally, that the
defamatory matter was published or spoken of the plaint
iff; if the allegation be denied, the plaintifff must prove
the facts, showing that the defamatory matter was pub
lished or spoken of him ; and in such action it shall not
be necessary to set out any obscene word, but it shall be
sufficient to state its substance. [51 v. 57, § 124.]
Privilege of witness, 20 Bull 186; of counsel, Id. 189. State
ments In pleadings privileged, Id. 193 ; see 4 C. C. R. 15.
§ 5094. Id. Truth of matter and mitigating circum
stances. In the actions mentioned in the preceding sec
tion, the defendant may allege and prove the truth of
the matter charged as defamatory ; and in every case he
may prove any mitigating circumstances to reduce the
amount of damages. [51 v. 57, §125 ; S. & C. 985.]
It may be shown, in mitigation, that the reputation of the
plaintifff, a female, for chastity was bad, where the slanderous
words charge a want of chastity, 32 O. S. 604 ; but specific acts of
sexual intercourse by her can not be given in evidence for any
purpose under an issue made by a general denial. Id. It may
be shown in mitigation, that defendant, when the words were
spoken, named his author, and that such third person had
spoken the words, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 253; that plaintifff's wife, against
whom the words were spoken imputing a want of chastity, aud
an unmarried man had lived together alone in one house, 6
O. S. 516 ; see \ 5060, libel and slander ; 21 Bull 93, 292.
§ 5095. Real property. How described. In an action
for the recovery of real estate, the property shall be de
scribed with such certainty as will enable an officer
holding an execution to identify it. [51 v. 57, \ 126 ;
S. & C. 986.]
§ 5096. Pleadings to be liberally construed. The alle
gations of a pleading shall be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties. [51 v.
57,? 114; S.&C.983.]
8 O. S. 215, 218 ; 10 O. S. 621 ; 14 O. S. 417, 422 ; 38 O. S. 314 ; 39
O. S. 57.
§ 5097. Sole days for pleading. The answer or de
murrer by the defendant shall be filed on or before the
third Saturday, and the reply or demurrer by the plaint
iff on or before the fifth Saturday, after the return day
of the summons, or service by publication ; and the
answer or demurrer of a defendant to a cross-petition
shall be filed on or before the third Saturday, and the
reply or demurrer thereto on or before the fifth Saturday,
after the cross-petition is filed. [51 v. 57, \ 103 ; S. & C.
982.]
In cases appealed from a justice of the peace, see I 6598. In
jpio warranto, \ 6772 ; 11 Bull 294. It is too late, on error, to object
to the filing of a demurrer to a petition after rule day, 44 O. S.
12; 15 Bull 103. The plaintifffagainst whom an answer " demand
ing affirmative relief" is filed is "a defendant to a cross-peti
tion," and this section gives him until the " third Saturday after
the cross-petition is filed" to plead it. A Judgment taken by
 such defendant before such third Saturday, without the knowl
edge of the plaintifff, is obtained by " irregularity," and should
be set aside by a proceeding under 13 5354-5365, 40 O. S. 344 ; see
Id. 485.
§ 5098. Bule day may be extended. The court, or a
judge thereof in vacation, may, for good cause shown,
extend the time for filing any pleading, upon such terms
as are just. [51 v. 57, \ 104 ; S. & C. 982.]
1 H. 290; 4 Bull 958, S. C. 8 Rec. 352; 15 Kas. 242 ; 6 Neb. 351.
The defendant is not excused from filing his pleadings within
the rule because the plaintifff has failed to comply with an order
togive security for costs, 18 O. 240. It is discretionary with the
court to receive or reject the statute of limitations after the rule
day for pleading has expired and the party is in default, Id.
Where the court gave leave to file a petition within sixty days,
and, in default, ordered that the case stand dismissed, and a
petition was filed two days after-the expiration of the sixty days,
the defendant, after answer, trial, and judgment, can not insist
on the dismissal, 10 O. S. 621.
§ 6099. Interrogatories may be annexed to a pleading.
A party may annex to his pleading, other than a demur
rer, interrogatories pertinent to the issue made in the
pleadings, which interrogatories, if not demurred to,
shall he plainly and fully answered under oath, by the
party to whom they are propounded, or if such party is
a corporation, by the president, secretary, or other officer
thereof, as the party propounding requires. [70 v. 54,
§ 105.]
Interrogatories authorized by this section must be confined to
matters stated or referred to in the pleadings, 4 W. L. M. 144. If
it is irregular to insert interrogatories in pleadings, the irregu
larity should be taken advantage of by motion, and is waived by
demurrer, Id. Interrogatories which could have been attached
to the petition will, on motion, be stricken out of the reply.
Id. 146.
§ 5100. When interrogatories to be answered. When
annexed to the petition, the interrogatories shall be
answered within the time limited for answer to the peti
tion ; when annexed to the answer, -they shall be an
swered within the time limited for a reply; when an
nexed to the reply, they shall be answered within the
time allowed for an answer; but further time may be
allowed in all cases by the court, or a judge thereof in
vacation. [70 v. 54, § 105.]
§ 5101. How answers may be enforoed. Answers to in
terrogatories may be enforced by non-suit, j udgment by default, or by attachment, as the justice of the case may
require ; and, on the trial, such answers, so far as they
contain competent testimony on the issue or issues made,
maybe used by either party. [70 v. 54,3105;] 44 <) S.610.
§ 5102. Pleadings to be subscribed and yenned. Erery pleading and motion must be subscribed by the
party or his attorney, and every pleading of fact, except
as provided in the next section, must be verified by the
affidavit of the party, his agent or attorney ; when a cor
poration is the party, the verification may be made by
an officer thereof, its agent or attorney; and when the
state, or any officer thereof in its behalf, is the party,
the verification may ]<e made by any person acquainted
with the facts, the attorney prosecuting or defending the
action, the prosecuting attorney, or the attorney-general.
[52 v. 22, 1 106 ; 70 v. 54, 1 105; S. & C. 982.]
See § 213. The verification is no part of the pleading, 6 How.
Pr. 200, and is not necessary to vestjurisdiction. 2 Neb. 180. Iu
omission may be supplied, 2 C. S. V. R. 30; 2 W. I,. M. 548: contra,
1 W. L. XI. 394; and if defective, it may be amended, 3 W. L. M.
604; 16 How. Pr. 129, without requiring the Issuing of a new sum
mons, Bates PI. 253, citing 2 W. L. M. 312 ; contra, 2 C. S. (J. R. SO ;
3 W. L. M. 604; Id. 394 ; 2 Id. 548. The objection to such omis
sion is by motion to strike from the files, 2 W. L. M. 54K ; Id. 602;
3 Id. 604; 11 Kas. 121; 6 Neb. 435. A defective verification in
waived by pleading over or demurring, 3 W. L. M. 604 ; 62 Ind.
179; when no objection is made until after rendition of j udgment,
8 Neb. 214; where a warrant of attorney to confess judgment au
thorized a release of all errors, 31 O. S. 435. The want of a
verification can not be raised on the trial, 74 N. Y. 307 ; nor for
the first time in a reviewing court, 29 Ark. 500. A failure to sign
the affidavit of verification is not ground for dismissal of the
action, but the practice is to file a motion to strike the petition
from the files, 6 Neb. 435. A failure to subscribe the pleading
is not ground for reversal of judgment, no advantage of the
defect having been taken at the proper time, 26 O. S. 644. The
signature, it is held, may be printed instead of written, 49 Cal.
413; and the court is not bound to try the question of the genu
ineness of the signature, 30 Cal. 192. The verification, it has been
held, need not state the venue, 2 W. L. M. 588; see 43 la. 605 ; 18
Minn. 90 cf. 6 How. Pr. 394 : 7 Neb. 146. The verification of an
insufficient pleading will not aid it, 1 Minn. 241 ; nor prevent its
being stricken out as sham, 13 Minn. 165.
§ 6103. When verification not required. The verifi
cation mentioned in the preceding section shall not be
required to the answer of a guardian, defending for an
infant, or a person of unsound mind, or the attorney of
a person imprisoned ; nor in any case where the admis
sion of the truth of a fact stated in the pleading might subject the party to a criminal or penal prosecution.
[51 v. 57, §107; 8. & C. 982.]
It is not necessary in divorce or alimony cases, § 5697; nor in
petitions in error, 9 Neb. 502, unless they contain issuable facts,
35 O. S. 244; nor "where the admission of the truth of a fact
stated in the pleading might subject the party to a criminal or
penal prosecution," 31 Hun 563.
§ 5104. When one of several parties may verify. If
several parties are united in interest, and plead together,
the affidavit may be made by one of them. [51 v. 57,
§108; S.&C.982.]
I N. Y. Law Bull. 29. But all parties not united in interest
should verify, 10 Abb. Pr. 66 ; 5 Bosw. 066 ; 14 How. Pr. 305. If the
action is defended for the immediate benefit of one not a party
to the record, and he is a party in interest, the pleading may be
verified by him, 6 Abb. Pr. n. s. 147 ; and unless the wife is a
mere nominal party, she should join with the husband in the
verification, 12 How. Pr. 395.
§ 5105. Sufficiency of affidavit. The affidavit shall be
sufficient if it is stated therein that the affiant believes
the facts stated in the pleading to be true. [51 v. 57,
§ 109 ; S. & C. 982.]
II O. S. 183, 188. A verification that affiant is informed and
believes plaintifff* is absent from the county is insufficient. 2 W.
L. M. 602.
,
§ 5106. Verification by non-resident. When the party
pleading is a non-resident of the county in which, the
action is brought, or is absent from the county wherein
the pleading is filed, an affidavit made before filing the
pleading, and filed with it, stating the substance of the
facts afterwards inserted in the pleading, shall be a suf
ficient verification [51 v. 57, § 1 10 ; S. & C. 982.]
See 1 W. L. M. 199; 10 Kas. 112.
§ 5107. Affidavit of verification to be signed and certi
fied. The affidavit verifying a pleading may be made
before any person before whom a deposition might be
taken, and must be signed by the party who makes it ;
the officer before whom the same was taken shall certify
that it was sworn to before him and signed in his pres
ence ; and the certificate of the officer, signed officially by
him, shall be evidence that the affidavit was duly made,
that the name of the officer was written by himself, and
that he was such officer. [51 v. 57, § 111 ; S. & C. 9S3.]
"Subscribed and sworn to before me " a sufficient form, 2 D.
472. " Subscribed before me " equivalent to "subscribed in my
presence," Id.; 3 Law Gaz. 252. The affidavit may be made be
fore the clerk of the supreme court or common pleas, whether
the pleading be used in the county where it is verified or in any
other county of the state, 1 W. L. M. 210. It can not be made
before the attorney of the party as notary public, 2 W. L. M. 312;
51 How. Pr. 205; 11 Kas. 123; contra, 6 Bull 289.
§ 5108. When verification applies to amount claimed.
The verification of the pleading does not apply to the
amount claimed, except in actions founded on contract,
express or implied, for the payment of money only. [51
v. 57, §112; S.&C.983.]
An allegation of the amount due on an account is within the
exception of this section, and must be controverted by answer,
25 O. S. 635, 638. In actions founded on contract the verification
does not prima facie embrace or determine the amount of recov
ery, and it is error to enter judgment thereon without evidence
of amount or value, 2 C. C. R. 143.
§ 5109. Affidavit by agent or attorney. The affidavit
verifying a pleading can be made by the agent or attor
ney only :
1. When the facts are within the personal knowledge
of the agent or attorney.
2. When the plaintifff is an infant or of unsound mind
or imprisoned.
3. When the pleading to be verified is founded upon
a written instrument for the payment of money, and
such instrument is in the possession of the agent or at
torney.
4. When the party is not a resident of, or is absent
from, the county. [51 v. 57, §113; S. & C. 983.]
1. W. L. M. 602 ; 4 W. Law Gaz. 404. 3. 3 W. Law Gaz. 246 ; but a
petition in an action on a mortgage, it was held, could not be
verified by an agent or attorney, 31 O. S. 168, or on a note and
mortgage, 3 W. L. M. 604.
§ 5110. Pleading not to be used against party in crim
inal proceeding. A pleading, verified as herein required,
shall not be used against a party in any criminal prose
cution or action or proceedings for a penalty or forfeit
ure, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such plead
ing ; and such verification shall not make other or greater
proof necessary on the side of the adverse party. [52 v.
22, §106; S. &C. 982.]
§ 5111. Amendment of petition before answer. The
plaintifff may amend his petition without leave, at any
time before the answer is filed, without prejudice to the
proceeding; but notice of such amendment shall be
served upon the defendant or his attorney ; and the de
fendant shall have the same time to answer or demur
thereto as to the original petition. [51 v. 57, \ 134 ; S.
& C. 989.]
Amendments without leave will be allowed to almost any ex
tent, provided the facts alleged by way of amendment are only
such as serve to explain orj,erfect the cause of action already
presented, 9 How. Pr. 140. The real limitation seems to be that
the amendment will not bring a new cause of action. 70 N. Y.
190 ; but it is held a pleading may be amended, of course, by ad
ding a new and distinct cause ol action or defense, 22 How. Pr.
229, provided the new cause of action be not inconsistent with
the one stated in the original petition, 41 Barb. 54 ; by striking
out one of the causes of action, 15 Abb. Pr. 51 ; by changing the
place of trial, 28 How. Pr. 20; by striking out the plaintifff and
inserting the real party in interest, 1 H. 236 ; but in an action
against a firm in its firm name, a pleading substituting the in
dividual members requires a new summons, 2 D. 586. A plead
ing can be amended without leave but once in the whole course
of the action, and if a party deems it important to amend a
second time he must apply to the court, 30 How. Pr. 1; but his
right to amend without leave is not lost unless the change in
the pleading amounts to an amendment in fact, 1 Duer. 629, and
the fact that portions of the pleading are, on motion, struck out
«s irrelevant and redundant can not be considered an amend
ment within the meaning of the code provision on the subject,
20 How. Pr. 328. Adding a verification to a petition is not an
amendment, 6 How. Pr. 200; and a change of parties has been
held not to be amendment of pleadings, 6 Abb. Pr. 213. An
amended pleading supersedes the original, and the original
ceases to perform any other functions as a pleading, 12 How. Pr.
521 ; and where the answer to an amended petition does not
make the original answer a part thereof, the issues made by the
original answer will be disregarded, 30 O. S. 555. An amendment
of the petition relates back to the commencement of the action,
which dates from the filing of the original petition and issuing
of summons thereon, 33 Cal. 497, and may therefore prevent the
statute of limitations from barring a cause of action not in
cluded in the original, 21 How. Pr. 283; but see 21 Bull 319; 46
O. S.
.
§ 5112. Amendment after demurrer. At any time
within ten days after a demurrer is filed, the adverse
party may amend, without leave, on payment of costs
since filing the defective pleading ; and notice of filing
an amended pleading shall be forthwith served upon the
other party, who shall have the same time thereafter to answer, or reply thereto, as to an original pleading.
[51 v. 57, § 135; S. & C. 989.]
This section refers to amendments without leave of court,
but not to amendments made in open court by leave of court,
8 Neb. 445.
§ 5113. Answer or reply after demurrer overruled.
"When a demurrer is overruled, the party who demurred
may answer or reply, if the court is satisfied that he has
a meritorious claim or defense, and did not demur for
delay. [51 v. 57, § 136 ; S. & C. 989.]
Defendant may be required to plead instanter, 9 Neb. 310.
§ 5114. Amendment of pleading, process, or proceeding.
The court may, before or after judgment, in furtherance
of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend
any pleading, process, or proceeding, by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake
in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the
case, or, when the amendment does not change substan
tially the claim or defense, by conforming the pleading
or proceeding to the facts proved ; and when an action
or proceeding fails to conform to the provisions of this
title, the court may permit the same to be made con
formable thereto by amendment. [51 v. 57, ? 137 ; S. &
C. 989.]
General remarks. Changing cause of action. The allowing or
refusing amendments, except those without leave, is a matter
resting largely in the discretion of the court, the exercise of
which will not be reviewed on error except in cases of abuse,
20 O. S. 128. An abuse of discretion will not be presumed, 16
Neb. 673. The record must show affirmatively that the discretion
was abused, 20 O. S. 128, 135; 25 O. S. 609. It is an abuse of dis
cretion to allow the filing of an amended petition that does not
state a cause of action, and an order allowing such petition to be
filed may be reversed on appeal, 61 Wis. 31 ; so the discretion of
a referee in denying an amendment will be reviewed and his
decision reversed when general justice will be promoted and
future litigation thereby prevented, 16 Jones & S. 46. In actions
between individuals, it is not an abuse of discretion to allow or
refuse the defense of the statute of limitations by amendment,
61 Wis. 222, or to refuse an amendment which is a substantial
repetition of a former pleading, 14 la. 57, or one setting up a new
cause of action. 2 W. L. M. 437. Two tests are given by which
to determine whether a second petition is an amendment or a
substitution of a new cause of action : 1, that the same evi
dence will support both petitions; 2, that the same measure of
damages will apply to both, 69 Mo. 170 ; 79 Mo. 449. If both these
tests fail, the new pleading is not an amendment, 79 Mo. 449 ; aa
where the first petition was in trover for certain goods and the second charged that the defendant had maliciously sued out a writ of
attachment and caused the goods to be seized and sold at a sacri
fice, it was held that the latter stated a new and distinct cause
of action and was not an amendment. Id.; but an amendment
merely changing the form of the action is not a substantial
change of the claim within the meaning of the statute, 7 Bull 15,
301 ; as an amendment changing a petition for money to a
demand to subject separate property of married woman, 7 Bull
15 ; a petition alleging a special to one setting up a general part
nership, 7 Bull 301 ; a petition for false imprisonment to one for
malicious prosecution, 3 Bull 1139, and vice cersa, 14 O. S. 213; a
petition in law to one in equity, 4 W. L. M. 153; an action in
case to one in trespass, 6 O. 388 ; and changing the prayer of the
petition is not a substantial change of the action, 1 Clev. R. 115;
2 C. S. C. R. 167 ; but a claim for money had and received can
not be changed to oue for conversion, 1 Clev. R. 17; and an
amendment substituting specific performance for damiiges, will
not be allowed as a matter of course, 1 H. 434. After service in
attachment, a petition can not be amended so as to set up a new
cause of action, IH.573; or enlarge the scope of the attachment,
2 C C. R.110. In allowing amendments to answers, the court does
not now regard the character of the defense sought to be intro
duced, 10 Hun 109, as it did formerly before the adoption of the
code, Bliss Code Pi. § 431. Any defense, though unconscionable
in its nature, as the statute of limitations or usury, may be set
up by way of amendment, 41 Barb. 337 ; 13 Abb. Br. 268. "' What
ever mav have been the earlier doctrine on the subject of what
were called unconscionable defenses, it no longer prevails. The
rules which govern amendments are now to be regarded with
out reference to the character of the defense," 17 N. Y. Supreme
Co. 109.
How made. An amendment can not be made by mutilating
or altering the files. A new pleading should be filed, or a state
ment of the amendment designating by reference where the new
matter is to be inserted, or what is to be considered as stricken
out, 10 O. S. 621. But where the alteration is made by striking
out or inserting new matter in the original pleading, with the
permission of the court, and no prejudice results to the adverse
party, the final judgment will not be reversed therefore, 21 O. S.
98; 4 Bull 910; 8 Rec. 357.
Amendments allowed in affidavit in attachment, 23 O. S. 192 ; 2 D.
505 ; but after service in attachment the court will not allow the
petition to be amended setting up a new cause of action, 1 H.
573, 574, and in an attachment against a non-resident firm the
court will not allow the process to be amended without preju
dice to the attachment by inserting the individual names of the
defendants, Id. An appeal bond may be amended, 6 O. S. 81 ; 35
O. S. 638, by the insertion of omitted conditions, 31 O. S. 131;
see Id. 8311; and in an action on a bond after reversal of judg
ment the court, to which the cause has been remanded for
further proceedings, may. by way of amendment.'allow breaches
to be assigned on the bond which were not assigned in the orig
inal petition, 25 O. S. 620. Court may ma sponte require a plead
ing to be amended, 20 O. S. 62, 63. An execution may be amended,
19 O. 67, 104, and amendments are allowed in mandamus, 23 O. S.
335 ; 4 O. S. 493; § 6751. A motion to vacate a judoment may be
amended, 9 O. S. 505. A new cause of action can not be set up
§ 4 C. C. R. 35. by way of amendment, 2 W. L. M. 437 ; but it is immaterial if it
is insufficient, 40 O. S. 507. The form of the action, however,
may be changed, 7 Bull 15, 301: 3 Id. 1139; 14 O. S. 213. An
amendment will be allowed by striking out the name of a nom
inal party and inserting that of the real party plaintifff. IH. 236;
2 H. 67 ; in cases of misnomer, 1 H. 191 ; such defect, unless
pleaded in abatement, is disregarded, 36 O. S. 296. Prayer for
relief may be changed, 2 C. S. C. R. 167. On petition in error
the district court may order the common pleas to send up a per
fect transcript of its record, but has no power to order an amend
ment of the record, 15 O. S. 295. Amendment of record after
proceedings in error, 9 O. S. 526. Sheriff's return amendable 4 O.
49, 59, 60 ; 8 O. S. 322 ; 10 O. S. 77 ; but not so ns to prejudice in
tervening rights, 30 O. S. 344 ; 13 O. 220. Summons, 1 H. 95 ; 26
O. S. 467. Undertaking for second trial, 28 O. S. 90. Amendment
of reply at trial, setting up insanitv to defense of suicide, refused,
4 Bull 848 ; 8 Rec. 306. Verdict not amendable, 9 O. 131. Verifi
cation of pleading amendable, 3 W. L. M. 604.
Amendments on appeal. The allowance or refusal of amend
ments on appeal is addressed to the sound discretion of the
court, and its ruling thereon is not reviewable except in cases of
manifest abuse of discretion, 25 O. S. 609. After demurrer sus
tained on appeal, a party may ask leave to amend, 29 O. S. 440;
and where facts necessary to determine the original cause of
action have been omitted in the pleadings below, or the cause
of action imperfectly stated, amendments on appeal have been
allowed, 8 O. 32. So, where the facts require it, new parties may
be brought in on appeal by amendment, Id.; 12 O. S. 11, 33; see
20 O. S. 38 ; but an amendment setting up a new and different
cause of action will not be permitted on appeal, 8 O. S. 32; 30
O. S. 365; and an amendment on appeal from a justice of the
peace will not be permitted increasing the claim beyond a sum
within his jurisdiction, 21 O. S. 659.
Defects cured. Under the code where a material fact is stated
in a pleading, but stated defectively, the defect will be cured by
a verdict or finding without the necessity of an amendment.
" Every reasonable presumption and fair constructive intend
ment will be made to sustain the pleading after verdict," 7 O. S.
270; 11 O. S. 393 ; 30 O. S. 183; but this rule is subject to the
qualification that the facts, when well stated, will constitute a
cause of action, 11 O. S. 393. The objection that the petition
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action may
be made at any time before hearing on error in the reviewing
court, 16 O. S. 118, 128; 30 O. S. 133; and such a defect is not
cured by verdict, 10 O. S. 567. But where there is otherwise a
good cause of action, though defectively stated, the defect may
be cured by the pleading of the opposite party. If the answer
avers or confesses a material allegation omitted in the petition
the defect in the petition is thereby cured, 9 O. S. 43; 9 O. S.461;
S3 O. S. 555: 2 O. 197; 24 O. S. 345, 357 The defendant is enti
tled to the benefit of admissions in the petition to sustain a de
fective answer, 9 O. S. 461, and it was held that an answer defect
ive in substance might be cured by averments made in the
reply, 1 Colo. 299 ; but an omission in the petition, of a fact essen
tial io plaintifff's cause of action, is not cured by pleading it in
his reply, 15 Minn. 479.
§ 6115. Immaterial errors and defects. The court, in
every stage of an action, must disregard any error or
defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not
affect the substantial rights of the adverse party ; and
no judgment shall be reversed, or affected, by reason of
such error or defect. [51 v. 57, § 138 ; S. & C. 990.]
Judgment will not be reversed for refusal to sustain a mo
tion to separately state and number causes of action, 36 O. S. 43,
because the form of action was misconceived, " in case the facts
are substantially alleged, which the party was bound to prove
on the trial in order to entitle him to a recovery," 1 O. 8. 225;
because a bad reason was given for a correct judgment by the
court which rendered it, HO. 28, 37 ; 4 O. S. 251; 12 O. S. 87, 90;
17 O. S. 374, 381; 13 O. 21 ; for admission of incompetent testi
mony objected to at the trial, unless it appears that its admis
sion was prejudicial, 11 O. S. 470; 18 O. S. 343 ; 22 O. S. 62; for
error beneficial to the party seeking the reversal, 13 O. 131 ; 2 O.
343; where the defect consists in the omission to aver the per
formance of a condition precedent in the contract sued on, and
it appears from the subsequent pleadings and record that the
defendant was not prejudiced thereby, 24 O. S. 345 ; for an erro
neous instruction, where it appears from the record that the
party objecting was not prejudiced by it, 31 O. S. 219; where
summons and an order for the delivery of specific personal
property were issued upon a petition and single affidavit con
taining allegations sufficient to entitle the party to such order,
38 O. S. 657; where the liability sought to be enforced was on a
promissory note, while the cause of action proved was for money
loaned or the consideration of the note, 41 O. S. 68 ; where the
court allowed defendant to open and close in a civil action
for assault and battery, 37 O. S. 415; where parties on appeal
from a justice of the peace proceeded to trial before a jury upon
a transcript of the justice, and no objection being taken there
was a verdict and judgment. It O. S. 692 ; where, in an action to
foreclose a mortgage by a building association, toe secretary and
treasurer prayed judgment for taxes paid in his own name,
and it appeared that the taxes were paid by him for the benefit
of the association and with its money,42 O. S. 73 ; see 1 C. C. R. 62.
§ 5116. Amendment after demurrer sustained. If the
demurrer be sustained, the adverse party may amend, if
the defect can be remedied by amendment, with or
without costs, as the court in its discretion shall direct.
[51 v. 57 J 139; S. & C. 990.]
But if no leave to amend be asked for, it is not error to pro
ceed to final judgment against the plaintifff without granting
leave to amend, 22 O. S. 159.
§ 5117. Continuance after amendment. When either
party amends a pleading or proceeding, and the court is
satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the adverse party
could not be ready for trial in consequence of the amendment, a continuance may be granted to some day
in term, or to another term of the court. [51 v. 57,
\140; S. &C. 990.]
1 W. L. M. 351. The application for a continuance is addressed
to the sound discretion of the court, 6 Neb. 337. The affidavit
to procure evidence must show the testimony which affiant
expects will be given by the absent party, 1 Neb. 118. An affi
davit that the defendant has been informed that a person ab
sent from the state would swear to certain material facts is
insufficient, 6 Neb. 337. Grounds for, see 1* Bull 365.
§ 5118. When party may be aued by fictitious name.
When the plaintifff is ignorant of the name of a defend
ant, such defendant may be designated in any plead
ing or proceeding by any name and description, and,
when the true name is discovered, the pleading or pro
ceeding may be amended accordingly ; and the plaintifff,
in such case, must state, in the verification of his
petition, that he could not discover the true name, and
the summons must contain the words " real name un
known," and a copy thereof must be served personally
upon the defendant. [51 v. 57, \ 141 ; S. & C. 990.] .
§ 5119. Supplemental pleading. Either party may be
allowed, on such terms as to costs as the court, or a judge
thereof, may prescribe, to file a supplemental petition,
answer, or reply, alleging facts material to the case
which occur subsequent to the filing of the former peti
tion, answer, or reply ; but reasonable notice of the
application must be given, when the court or judge so
requires. [51 v. 57, \ 142 ; S. & C. 990.]
The office of a supplemental pleading is to bring into the
record new facts, so that the court may render its final judg
ment upon the facts existing at the time of its rendition, 90 1 nd.
585. It is the only proper method of presenting facts occurring
during the pendency of an action, 6 How. l'r. 13; 10 O. S. 372.
A petition setting up antecedent facts is not a supplemental
petition, 33 O. S. 336. A supplemental petition must be con
sistent with and in aid of the case made by the original petition,
10 O. S. 365, 372. A new cause of action can not be set up by
way of supplemental petition, especially a cause of action to
which plaintifff was not entitled when he commenced his action,
2 Hun 043. It can not be filed alter final judgment for the pur
pose of vacating, reversing, or modifying such judgment, 39
O. S. 543, 546. It has been allowed by creditors seeking to en
force the contingent liability of stockholders defendants who,
before the commencement of the action, had assigned their
stock, 8 Bull 23; in foreclosure, where a secured note matures
pending the action, to find the amount due, 2 W. L. M. 599 ; 7
O. (Pt. 2l 231 ; in actions by or against representatives or successors in interest of a deceased party, 24 O. S. 182 ; in proceedings
in aid to collect a judgment, if set aside, and a new judgment
obtained, 10 O. S. 365; 8 O. 203. But in an action to enforce a
lien, neither a supplemental pleading nor an amendment is
necessary to recover notes falling due after filing the original
petition, where the instrument creating the lien and the petition
show that it was given to secure those due and to become due
before final decree, 16 lu. 422; and in ejectment plaintifff must
still rely upon his title originally set out, and can not, by sup
plemental petition, rely upon one since acquired, 14 S. C. 434.
A supplemental answer takes the place of the former plea puis
darrein continuance, and any defense which the party may set
up in that plea he may set up by supplemental answer, 16 Abb.
Pr. 269, as accord and satisfaction, 12 O. S. 98; bankruptcy, 16
O. 12; defense arising after issue joined in ejectment, 5 O. 452;
payment. 6 O. 534; though a supplemental answer is not likes
plea puis darrein continuance, 4 W. L. J. 1 (see 12 O. S. 98),'a
waiver of defenses before interposed, and is not confined to matters arising since the last continuance, 46 N. Y. 200. 203. The
allowance of such an answer is said to be discretionary with the
court, 22 Kas. 753 ; see 72 N. Y. 442 ; but when the facts sought to
be pleaded amount to an en tire satisfaction of the cause of action,
it is the duty of the court to allow it, 8 How. Pr. 56.
§ 5120. When actions may be consolidated. When two
or more actions are pending in the same court, the de
fendant may, on motion, and notice to the adverse
party, require him to show cause why the same shall
not be consolidated ; and if it appear that, at the time
the motion is made, the actions could have been joined,
and if the court, or a judge thereof, find that they ought
to be joined, the several actions shall be consolidated.
[51 v. 57, \\ 143, 144; S. & C. 990, 991.]
44 O. S. 346 ; 15 Bull 386. As where two actions are brought,
one upon a note and the other to foreclose a mortgage securing
it, 3 W. Law Gaz. 266.
SUBDIVISION VIII. MOTIONS.
ji 5121. What is a motion. A motion is an application
for an order, addressed to a court or judge, by a party to
a suit or proceeding, or one interested therein. [51 v. 57,
§ 503 ; S. & C. 1098.]
A motion is the proper remedy for uncertainty, argumenta
tiveness and informality in a pleading, 14 O. S. 200 ; 6 O. S. 293 ;
to separately state causes of notion, 10 O. S. 441 ; to strike plead
ings from the files, 260. S. 659, 662; for judgment on pleadings,
31 O. S. 492; to vacate judgment. 11 O. S. 503; for judgment jion
obstante veredicto, 3 Bull 54; 6 Rec. 564; for new trial, £ 5308; to
correct mistakes and omissions of clerk or irregularity in ob
taining a judgment or order, § 5357. Motion to strike out is not
the proper remedy for uncertainty, 1 D. 17, 458 ; nor is demurrer,
29 O. S. 499. A motion can not supply the place of a demurrer,
§ 5122. Motion may include several objects. Several
objects may be included in the same motion, if they all
grow out of, or are connected with, the action or pro
ceeding in which it is made. [51 v. 57, \ 504 ; S. a C.
1098.]
§ 5123. Hotice of motion. When notice of a motion
is required, it must be in writing, and shall contain the
names of the parties to the action or proceeding in
which it is made, the name of the court or judge
before -whom it is to be made, the place where and
the day on which it will be heard, the nature and terms
of the order or orders to be applied for, and, if affidavits
are to be used on the hearing, that fact shall be stated ;
and the notice shall be served a reasonable time before
the hearing. [51 v. 57, \ 505 ; S. & C. 1098.]
20 Kas. 370. Parties are bound to take notice of all motions
and orders made in court during the pendency of the action, 2
W. L. M. 329, but not after final judgment, Id.
§ 5124. Who may serve notioes. Notices of motions
may be served by a sheriff, coroner, or constable, or by
a disinterested person ; and the return of an officer, or
affidavit of such person, shall be proof of service. [51
v. 57, § 506 ; S. & C. 1098.]
§ 5125. How service to be made. The service of a
notice shall be made as required for the service of a
summons, and when served by an officer he shall be
entitled to like fees ; the service shall be on the party,
or his attorney of record, if either is a resident of the
county in which the motion is made ; and if there is
more than one party adverse to such motion, service
shall be made upon each party, or his attorney. [51 v.
57, % 506, 507 ; S. & C. 1098.]
§ 5126. When notioe not required. Motions to strike
pleadings and papers from the files may be made with
or without notice, as the court or judge shall direct.
[51 v. 57, § 508 ; S. & C. 1099.]
17 Kas. 102 ; 2 Bates PI. 966. A motion to strike from the files is
waived by pleading over, 37 la. 422, or by demurring, 2 C. S. C. R.
S). The practice of making a motion to strike from the files
subserve the purposes of a general demurrer is not approved
by the courts, 26 O. S. 662. Where objections to the pleading are
based not on any irregularity connected with its filing, nor to
§ 6127. What is a trial. A trial is a judicial exami
nation of the issues, whether of law or of fact, in an
action or proceeding; [51 v. 57, § 262 ; S. & C. 1020.]
§ 5128. What is an issue. Issues arise on the plead
ings where a fact, or conclusion of law, is maintained
by one party and controverted by the other. They are
of two kinds :
1. Of law.
2. Of fact. [51 v. 57, \ 260 ; S. & C. 1020.]
§ 5207. Parties can not by contract require the court to try
their case contrary to established rules of judicial proceedings,
2 O. S. 21 ; and an agreement of counsel to consider the issues as
made up is of no effect, W. 524.
§ 6129. An issue of fact. An issue of fact arises :
1. Upon a material allegation in the petition denied
by the answer.
2. Upon a set-off, counterclaim, or new matter, pre
sented in the answer and denied by the reply.
3. Upon material new matter in the reply, which shall
be considered as controverted by the opposite party
withou t further pleading. [51 v. 57, § 261 ; S. & C. 1020.]
§ 6130. Issues. How tried. Issues of law must be
tried by the court (1), unless referred as hereinafter pro
vided ; and issues ol fact arising in actions for the re
covery of money only (2), or specific real (3) or personal
property, shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial be
waived (4), or a reference be ordered as hereinafter pro
vided. [51 v. 57, ? 263 ; S. & C. 1020.]
1. Issues of law should be disposed of before issues of fact, 5
O. S. 87. Where the facts stated in the petition and the nature of
the relief primarily demanded are within the sole jurisdiction
of a court ot equity, a jury trial is not demandable, 27 O. S. 47.
An action to compel the return of an insurance policy assigned
under duress is not triable by a jury, 1 C. C. R. 28; nor an action for the enforcement of a trust, and for an account by a trustee to
the cestui que trail, 10 O. S. 198 ; nor an action to foreclose a
mortgage, 2 H. 74; but where, in an action upon a note and
mortgage given to secure its payment, judgment is asked upon
the note and for the sale of the mortgaged property, either party
may demand ajury trial upon any issue olfact which affects the
judgment upon the note, 10 O. S. 437 ; see generally 12 Bull 261 ;
14 Bull 47. 2. Though numerous items of account and counter
claim are involved in the issue, 22 O. S. 372, and though the
action is in the nature of a proceeding in chancery, 4 V/. L. M.
153. 3. But in an action by persons claiming to be trustees of
an incorporated religious society to recover possession of the
real property of the society, an answer, denying that the plaintifffsaud alleging that the defendants are such trustees, presents
an issue which is properly triable by a jury, 12 O. S. 248. 4.
When, by consent of both parties, a jury is waived, aud the
cause submitted to the court, neither party can subsequently
withdraw his waiver, 1 C. S. C. R. 164; see 45 O. S. 356, 653; 46
Id. 27.
§ 5131. What issues to be tried by oourt. All other
issues of fact shall be tried by the court, subject to its
power to order any issue to be tried by a jury, or re
ferred. [51 v. 57, I 264 ; S. & C. 1021.]
SUBDIVISION H. TIME 'OF TRIAL.
§ 5132. Trial docket. The clerk shall make a trial
docket at least twelve days before the first day of each
term, and the cases shall be set for particular days, in
the order in which they stand on the appearance docket;
a case in all its stages in the same court, and upon every
docket or book, and all papers filed or issued therein,
shall bear the appearance docket number; but the clerk
shall not place upon the trial docket any case in which
nothing remains to be done except to execute an order
for the sale of real or personal property, and to distrib
ute the proceeds as directed by the order; and if it
becomes necessary, the case may be redocketed, on the
application of either party, whereupon it shall stand in
all respects as if it had remained on the docket. [55 v.
26, I 306 ; S. & C. 1034.]
The court does not lose jurisdiction of a case because it was
omitted from the docket by the clerk, 35 O. S. 648. The setting
of cases for trial in the Hamilton County Common PIeas Court
is not governed by this section, but by § 464, 11 Bull 122, 123;
see 1 5136.
§ 5133. Judgment on default. When entered. In an
action upon an account, or written instrument for the
payment of money only, or in foreclosure, judgment may
be entered; at any time during the term, after the defendant is in default for an answer; but the court may,
for good cause shown, give further time for answer. [66
v. 42; § 307.]
§ 5320 ; 25 O. S. 635 ; see 3 C. C. R. 144.
§ 6134. Order in which cases are to be heard. Cases
in which there is an issue of fact, or in which damages
are to be assessed, shall be tried in the order in which
they stand on the trial docket, unless, by the consent of the
parties, or by the order of the court, they are continued
or placed at the heel of the docket, or, for good cause
shown, may be especially assigned for trial or hearing
out of their regular order, and actions for wages shall
be first in order for trial; but the court may assign for
trial the cases triable to a jury, in a series in the order
in which they stand upon the docket, giving prefer
ence always to actions for wages, and cases not tri
able to a jury, in a series in like manner. All other cases
shall be heard in the order in which they stand upon the
trial docket, unless the court otherwise direct, and the
court may, at any time, hear a motion or demurrer, and
may, by rule, prescribe the time of hearing motions and
demurrers. Provided, that in any subdivision where
there are two or more judge-*, one of whom, for any
cause, shall bs disqualified to hear or try any of the
causes upon such trial docket, such causes may be as
signed for trial or hearing in a series in the order in
which they stand upon the docket, by a judge not dis
qualified to try the same, and may be tried and heard in
like order. [86 v. 109 ; 66 v. 42, \ 307.]
The granting or refusal of u continuance is a matter of judi
cial discretion, and not ground of error unless there is an abuse
of discretion, 32 O. S. 173; 11 O. S. 691 ; 10 O. S. 598; 18 O. S. 438.
446; 26 O. S. 7. Cases on demurrer may. in the discretion of
the court, be heard out of the order in which they stand on
the trial docket, 26 O. S. 141 (1875) ; see 34 O. S. 124, 126.
§ 5135. At what term actions triable. Actions are tri
able at the first term of the court after the issues therein,
by the times fixed for pleading, are or should have been
made up; when the issues are or should have been made
up during a term, such action shall be triable at that
term ; and when the issues are or should have been made
up either before or during a term of court, but after the
period for the preparation of the trial docket of the term, the clerk, if required by the court, shall place such
actions on the trial docket of that term. [51 v. 67, § 308 ;
S. & C. 1035.]
§ 5136. Clerk to make copy of trial dooket for bar.
The clerk shall make a copy of the trial docket for the
use of the bar before the first day of the term. [51 v.
57, § 309 ; S. & C. 1035.]
§ 5137. Flea of tender of money before suit. If, in an
action on a contract for the payment of money, the de
fendant answer and prove that he did tender payment
of the money due on the contract, at any time before the
commencement of the action thereon, and pay to the
clerk, at any time before trial, the money so tendered,
the plaintifff shall not have judgment for more than the
money so due and tendered, without costs, and shall pay
the defendant his costs. [51 v. 397, § 1 ; S. & C. 1140.]
A bank check is a good tender when the creditor object* only
to the amount, 7 O. S. 257 ; find bank notes, where a party de
clared he would as soon accept them as specie, 8 O. lGtf; r. S.
treasury notes, 26 O. S. 344. A tender is unnecessary alter re

§ 5138. Plea of tender of article or labor before suit.
If, in an action on a contract for the payment of any
article or thing other than money, or for the perform
ance of any work or labor, the defendant answer that
he did tender payment or performance of such contract,
at such time and place, and in such articles, work, or
labor, as by such contract he was bound to pay or per
form, and the court or jury find that he did tender, as
alleged in his pleading, they shall, at the same time,
assess the value of the property or labor so tendered,
and thereupon judgment shall be rendered in favor of the plaintifff for the sum so found, without interest or
costs ; but if the defendant forthwith perform his con
tract, or give to the plaintifff such assurance as the court
may approve that he will perform the same within such
time as the court may direct, judgment shall be rendered
for the defendant; and in case any article so tendered
is of a perishable nature, it shall from the time of such
tender, be kept at the risk and expense of the plaintifff,
provided the defendant take reasonable care of the same.
[51 v. 397, § 1 ; S. & C. 1140.]
Right to make subsequent tender when first is insufficient,
5 O. S. 51.
§ 5139. Offer to confess judgment before action. Be
fore an action for the recovery of money is brought
against any person, he may go into the court of the
county of his residence, or of that in which the person
having the cause of action resides, which would have
jurisdiction of the action, and offer to confess judgment
in favor of such person for a specified sum, on such
cause of action ; whereupon, if such person, having had
such notice that the offer would be made, of its amount,
and of the time and place of making it, as the court
deems reasonable, fail to attend to accept the confession,
or if he attend, and refuse to accept it, and afterwards
commence an action upon such cause, and fail to recover
more than the amount so offered to be confessed, and
the interest thereon from the date of the offer, he shall
pay all the costs of the action. [51 v. 57, \ 499 ; S. & C.
1095.]
§ 5140. Offer to confess out of court. The defendant
in an action for the recovery of money only, may, at
any time before the trial, serve upon the plaintifff, or his
attorney, an offer in writing to allow judgment to be
taken against him for the sum specified therein; if the
plaintifff accept the offer, and give notice thereof to the
defendant, or his attorney, within five days after service
of it, the offer, and an affidavit that the notice of ac
ceptance was delivered in the time limited, may be filed
by the plaintifff, or the defendant may file the accept
ance, with a copy of the offer, verified by affidavit ; in
either case the offer and acceptance shall be noted in
the journal, and judgment rendered accordingly; if the notice of acceptance be not given in the period limited,
the offer shall be deemed withdrawn ; and if the plain
tiff fail to obtain judgment for more than was offered by
the defendant, he shall pay the defendant's costs from
the time of the offer. [51 v. 57, \ 493; S. & C. 1094.]
25 O. S. 301. The " offer to compromise " can not properly be
made in an answer, 18 O. S. 373.
§ 5141. Offer to confess in open court. The defendant
in an action for the recovery of money may offer in
court to confess judgment for part of the amount
claimed, or part of the causes involved in the action ;
whereupon, if the plaintifff, being present, refuse to
accept such confession of judgment, in full of his de
mands against the defendant in the action, or, having
had such notice that the offer would be maile, of its
amount, and of the time of making it, as the court
deems reasonable, fail to attend, and, on the trial, do
not recover more than was so offered to be confessed,
and the interest thereon from the date of the offer, such
plaintifff shall pay all the costs of the defendant incurred
after the offer was made. [51 v. 57, \ 498; S. & C. 1095.]
See \ 6581 ; 18 O. S. 373. It is not sufficient to merely place a
written offer on file with the papers in the case, though the
plaintifff may have notice that such offer has been so made, 12
O. S. 624. The section is applicable to justices, 15 O. S. 511. An
offer to confess judgment before a justice of the peace is avail
able to defendant on appeal, 15 O. S. 511; 11 O. S. 554, and pre
vents the recovery of future costs, 3 O. 384; 11 O. S. 554.
§ 5142. Such offers not to affect the trial. An offer
made as provided in the three preceding sections shall
not be deemed an admission of the cause of action, nor
of the amount to which the plaintifff is entitled ; nor
shall it be a cause of continuance of the action, or a
postponement of the trial, or given in evidence, or men
tioned on the trial. [51 v. 57, $ 493, 494, 498, 499 ; S. &
C. 1094, 1095.]
§ 5143. Provisions made applicable to offer made by
plaintifff. The provisions of this subdivision shall be ap
plied, so far as they may fairly be made applicable, to a
tender or offer made by the plaintifff; and to the same
extent, the same provisions may, in the discretion of the
court, be applied to one or more of several causes of
action, counterclaim, or set-off, in which case the court
shall make such order as to costs as it deems proper.
§ 5144. What actions abate by death of party. Ex
cept as otherwise provided, no action or proceeding
pending in any court shall abate by the death of either
or both of the parties thereto, except an action for
libel, slander, malicious prosecution, assault, or assault
and battery, for a nuisance, or against a justice of the
peace for misconduct in office, which shall abate by
the death of either party. [75 v. 632, \ 18 ; 51 v. 57,
§ 399 ; S. & C. 1058.]
See \ 4975. The prosecution of the reputed father of a bastard
child does not abate by the death of the child, 19 O. S. 583. An
action formalicious prosecution. 1 H. 480, and for slander, 21 O. S.
536, did not, under 51 v. 57, abate by plaintifff's death, nor by de
fendant's death after verdict and before judgment, 6 O. S. 228, 246 ;
but before the code the death of appellant abated the action, 3
O.274. " Which," in the last clause of this section, embraces a'l
of the preceding causes of action, and not, as was claimed i21 O. S.
539), simply an action against a justice of the peace. Id. 542. A
cause of action for wrongfully causing death abates by the
death of the wrongdoer, 37 O. S. 372; but death, pending the ac
tion, does not abate it, 1 Clev. R. 122. Nuisance, 21 Bull 395.
§ 5145. Action for dower dces not abate. If the
plaintifff in an action for dower die before final judg
ment therein, the action may be revived in the name of
her personal representative, for the purpose mentioned
in § 5715. [60 v. 10, § 1 ; S. & S. 311.]
2 Bull 76.
§ 5146. When action may proceed without revivor.
When there are several plaintifffs or defendants, and one
of them dies, or his powers as a personal representative
cease, if the right of action survive to or against the
remaining parties, the action may proceed ; but the
death of the party, or the cessation of his powers, shall
be first stated on the record. [51 v. 57, § 400 ; S. & C.
1058.]
§ 5147. When action abates as to some parties, it may
proceed as to others. When one of several plaintifffs or
defendants dies, or his powers as a personal representa
tive cease, if the cause of action does not survive, the
court, if of opinion that the merits of the controversy
can be properly determined, and the principles appli
cable to the case fully settled, may proceed to try the
same as between the remaining parties ; but the judg
ment shall not prejudice any person who was not a
party at the time of the trial. [51 v. 57, \ 401 ; S. & C.
1058.]
§ 5148. Kevivor in favor of or against personal repre
sentative, etc. When one of the parties to an action
dies, or his powers as a personal representative cease be
fore judgment, if the right of action survives in favor
of or against his representatives or successor, the action
may be revived, and proceed in the name of such repre
sentatives or successor. [38 v. 146, \\ 240, 241 ; 51 v. 57,
§ 402; S. & C. 611, 612, 1058.]
Revivor in name of successor of assignee, 41 O. S. 591.
§ 5149. Bevivor by motion, or supplemental plead
ing. A revivor may be effected by the allowance by
the court, or a judge thereof in vacation, of a motion
of the representative or successor in interest to become a
party to the action, or by supplemental pleading alleging
the death of the party, and naming his representative
or successor in interest upon whom service may be
made as in the commencement of an action ; but the
limitations contained in subsequent sections of this
chapter do not apply to this section. [51 v. 57, § 39 ;
S. & C. 958.]
See I 5012 ; 24 O. S. 182; 29 O. S. 87. The court may allow the
representative of a deceased defendant in error to be made
party to the proceeding, though more than a year may have in
tervened from the death of such defendant to the time of
making application for such allowance, 30 O. S. 600; see 3" O. S.
143; 38 O. S. 96.
§ 5150. Revivor by conditional order. A revivor may
also be effected by a conditional orderof the court, if made
in term, or by a judge thereof, if in vacation, that the
action be revived in the name of the representative or
successor of the party who died, or whose powers ceased,
and proceed in favor of or against him. [51 v. 57, \ 403 ;
S. & C. 1058.]
37 O. S. 143; 29 O. S. 86; 10 Rec. 58.
§ 5151. By whom conditional order made. The order
may be made on the motion of the adverse party, or of
the representative or successor of the party who died, or
whose powers ceased, suggesting his death, or the cessa
tion of his powers, which, with the name and capacities
of his representative or successor, shall be stated in the
order. [51 v. 57, \ 404 ; S. & C. 1059.]
§ 5152. How conditional order served. If the order be
made by consent of the parties, the action shall forth
with stand revived ; if not made by consent, the order
shall be served upon the party adverse to the party on
whose motion it was made, in the same manner, and re
turned within the same time, as a summons ; and if suf
ficient cause be not shown against the revivor, the action
shall stand revived. [51 v. 57, § 405 ; S. & C. 1059.]
1 W. L. M. 403 ; 2 Id. 577.
§ 5153. When service may be made by publication.
When the plaintifff makes an affidavit that the repre
sentatives of the defendant, or any of them in whose
name the action is ordered to be revived, are non-resi
dents of the state, or have left the state to avoid the
service of the order, or so conceal themselves that the
order can not be served upon them, or that the names
and residence of the heirs or devisees of the person
against whom the action is ordered to be revived, or
some of them, are unknown to the affiant, a notice may
be published for six consecutive weeks, as provided by
§ 5048, notifying them to appear on a day therein named,
not less than ten days after the publication of the notice
is complete, and show cause why the action should not
be revived against them ; and if sufficient cause be not
shown to the contrary, the action shall stand revived.
[51 v. 57, 1 406 ; S. & C. 1059.]
No revivor against foreign administrator, 2 C. S. C. R. 55.
§ 5154. When plaintifff dies in whose name action re
vived. Upon the death of the plaintifff the action may
be revived in the names of his representatives to whom
his right has passed ; if his right has passed to his per
sonal representative, the revivor shall be in his name ;
and if it has passed to his heirs or devisees who could
support the action if brought anew, the revivor may be
in their names. [51 v. 57, \ 407 ; S. & C. 1059.]
By analogy this provision is applicable to proceedings in
error, 29 O. S. 633, 634.
§ 5155. When defendant dies, in whose name action re
vived. Upon the death of a defendant, in an action
wherein the right, or any part thereof, survives against
his personal representative, the revivor shall be against
him ; and it may also be against the heirs or devisees of the defendant, or both, when the right of action, or any
part thereof, survives against them. [51 v. 57, \ 408 ; S.
& C. 1059.]
§ 5156. When defendant in real action dies. Upon the
death of a defendant in an action for the recoverv of real
property only, or which concerns only his rights or
claims to such property, the action may be revived
against his heirs or devisees, or both, and an order there
for may be forthwith made, in the manner directed in
the preceding sections of this subdivision. [51 v. 57,
2409; S.&C. 1059.]
§ 5157. Limitation when defendant dies. An order to
revive an action against the representative or successor
of a defendant shall not be made without the consent of
such representative or successor, unless within one year
from the time it could have been first made. [51 v. 57,
§410; S. &C. 1059.]
§ 5158. Limitation when plaintifff diet. An order to
revive an action in the name of the representative or
successor of a plaintifff may be made forthwith, but shall

ant is dead, or his powers have ceased, the order of
revivor on both sides may be made in the period limited
in the last section. [51 v. 57, §4H ; S. & C. 1059.]
The mode of revivor provided for by these sections of the code
is not exclusive, but the court has discretion to follow the old
method, 24 O. S. 182; 29 O. S. 86; see \ 5149. Notice required,
1 Clev. R. 12.
§ 5159. Aotion to be dismissed when it can not be re
vived. When it appears by affidavit that the powers of
a party who sues or is sued as a personal representative
have ceased, or that either party to an action has been
dead, for a period so long that the action can not be re

without the consent of both parties, the court shall order
the action to be stricken from the docket. [51 v. 67,

of jurors to b« selected. The common pleas court of
each county shall, at the first term thereof in each year,
determine the number of persons necessary to be selected
in each county, annually, to serve as grand and petit
jurors in the several courts of such county, in which
juries may be required, and cause a memorandum
thereof to be entered on the journal ; such order, if not
made at that term, may be made at any other time, and
amended from time to time at the discretion of the court,
and until it is made, the number of persons to be selected
for jurors in each county shall be as theretofore deter
mined ; but if there has been no such determination, the
number shall be one hundred and thirty until otherwise

sary to have a new petit jury, or a member or members
to fill up the regular panel for the term, the court, or a
judge thereof, may order the names of the number of
jurors required for the new petit jury; or, in case he
deems it necessary to fill up the regular panel, he may
order not exceeding double the number of names of
jurors required therefore to be drawn from the box by
the clerk, as in other cases; and a venire issued to sum
mon them to appear as may be directed by the court, or

apply to the court for a special venire, which, upon such
application, the court shall direct to be issued to the
coroner of the county, commanding him to summon a
jury, having the qualifications hereinbefore prescribed,
to try such cause ; and when both the sheriff and coroner
are so interested, or in case of the death, resignation, or
absence from the county of both the sheriff and coroner,
then, and in either of such cases, the process may be
directed to such discreet, disinterested person as the
court may name, and the service and return of such
person shall be valid to all intents and purposes. [70 v.
171, 1 13.]
§ 5175. When challenge to the array may be made.
A challenge to the array may be made and the whole
array set aside by the court, when the jury, grand or
petit, was not selected, drawn, or summoned, or when the
officer who executed the venire did not proceed as pre
scribed by law. But no challenge to the array shall be
made or the whole array set aside by the court, by
reason of the misnomer of a juror or jurors; but on
challenge, a juror or jurors may be set aside by reason
of a misnomer in his or their names ; but such challenge
shall only be made before the jury is empaneled and
sworn, and no indictment shall be quashed or verdict
set aside for any such irregularity or misnomer if the
jurors who formed the same possessed the requisite quali
fications to act as jurors [81 v. 43 ; 70 v. 171, 1 12.]
Objection to array not received after challenge for cause, 6 O.
19; non-attendance of jurors not ground for challenge to the
array, 24 O. S. 143 ; misnomer, see 42 O. S. 154, 163.

2. That he has an interest in the cause.
3. That he has an action pending between him and
either party.

9. That he, not being a regular juror of the term, has
served once already as a talesman in the trial of any
cause, in any court of record in the county within the preceding twelve months; and in either of Raid oases
the same shall be considered as a principal challenge,
and the validity thereof tried by the court. [83 v. 105;

mast inane inquiry as to the fact at the time the juror is impan
eled, 23 O. S. 333. See3n O.S.32; 25O.S. 555; 2UO.S. 228. Iftbe
court erroneously overrule a challenge for cause, but the juror is
afterward challenged peremptorily, the error is not material if
it appear that an acceptable jury was empaneled before the
partv who challenged lor cause exhausted his right to per
emptory challenges, 16 O. S. 221 ; 29 O. S. 186.

§ 5177. Challenges to the favor and peremptory. Any
petit juror may be challenged also on suspicion of pre
judice (1) against, or partiality (2) for, either party, or
lor want of a competent knowledge of the English lan
guage (3), or for any other cause that may render him
at the time an unsuitable juror, and the validity of
such challenge shall be determined by the court; and
each party may peremptorily challenge two jurors (4.)
[73 v. 20, § 11.]
1. A "prejudice " which disqualifies a juror is usually sought
for by the question, " Have you formed or expressed an opinion
in this case?" 31 O. S. 139. If a juror has formed or expressed
an opinion in relation to a portion of the facts embraced in the
issue, but not upon the whole issue, and otherwise stands indif
ferent between the parties, the allowance or refusal of the
challenge is within the discretion of the court, Id. This is a
cause for challenge under § 7278 (hi v. 53) of the criminal code,
which provides, " but if a juror has formed or expressed an opin
ion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the court shall
thereupon proceed to examine such juror on oath ns to the
grounds of such opinion ; and if such juror shall say that he be
lieves he can render an impartial verdict notwithstanding such
opinion, and if the court is satisfied that such juror will render
an impartial verdict on the evidence, may admit him as compe
tent to serve in such case as a juror." Id.; see 42 O. S. 154.
2. To authorize the reversal of the judgment where such
challenge is sustained, an abuse of discretion must be clearly
shown, 3O O. S. 418. 3. Objection to the want of knowledge of
the language waived, 9 Bull 76. 4. Peremptory challenges
should be made after those for cause, 15 O. S. 221. See 4 O. 348 ;
20 O. S. 233 ; 32 O. S. 352 ; 42 O. S. 568; 18 Id. 438 ; 29 Id. 186.
§ 5178. Penalties against jurors refusing to Berre. A
person -summoned as a juror, who, without reasonable
and lawful cau.-.e, to be judged of by the court, refuses
to serve, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding thirty
dollars, as for a contempt of court; a juror, after being
qualified, who refuses or neglects to obey or observe any
order or injunction of the court, may be fined as for con
tempt, in any sum, in its discretion, not exceeding one
thousand dollars ; and any fine so assessed may be col
lected by execution, and shall be paid into the county
treasury and disbursed as other fines. [70 v. 173, $ 18.]
§ 5179. Jurors not required to serve more than three
weeks within the year. A person who serves as a juror,
grand or petit, or both, in the courts of this state, for three
weeks in any year, shall be exempt from further service
as a juror during the balance of the year; but nothing
herein contained shall entitle a juror to be discharged
from the' grand jury during its session, or from a petit
jury during the trial of a cause. [70 v. 173, \ 20.]
See § 5189fc. Hamilton, Cuyahoga and Franklin Counties.
§ 5180. Who are exempt from jury service. Public
officers, clergymen and priests, physicians, attorneys at
law, members of the police force or firemen employed by
the authority of a municipal corporation, acting volun
teer members of companies for the extinguishment of
fires, organized under and subject to the control of a
municipal corporation, and persons who serve as active
members of such companies for five consecutive years,
shall be exempt from service on juries. [67 v. 76, \ 326 ;
69 v. 54, \ 1 ; 70 v. 173, § 21 ; 73 v. 56, ? 26.]
See § 5189i. Tostmaster, 1 O. S. 66, 68. These provisions do
not have the effect to disqualify the person so exempted, but
merely extend to him a privilege which he may waive, 24
O. S. 201 Hamilton, Franklin and Cuyahoga Counties, § 5189..
§ 5181. Penalties against officers. No officer shall be
allowed compensation for services under this chapter
other than that allowed by law; and any officer named

duty therein required, shall be fined in any sum not
exceeding one hundred dollars. [70 v. 173, § 19.]
§ 6182. Compensation of jurors. Each grand and
petit juror drawn from the jury-box pursuant to law,
and each juror selected by the court, pursuant to
§ 5173 of this chapter, and each talesman shall be

and if not a talesman, five cents per mile from his place
of residence to the county seat, and such compensation
shall be certified by the clerk of the court, and paid by
the county treasurer on the warrant of the county
auditor. [S1 v. 128 ; 73 v. 134, $ 20, 21 ; 76 v. 109, § 21 .]
See § 5189m. The certificate of the clerk is not conclusive, and
if he certifies for days in excess of the number for which the
jurors are legally entitled to compensation, the auditor may
refuse to issue orders on the county treasury for such excess. 34
O. 8. 137 (73 v. 134, g 22). Under this act, jurors are to be allowed
compensation for days spent in whole or in part in going to and
returning from court, and for days of attendance during the
term, whether empaneled or not. But the clerk is not author
ized to certify that the jurors are entitled to compensation in
addition to such days for days as to which they were discharged
and not in attendance, 34 O. S. 137. Hamilton, Cuyahoga and
Franklin Counties, § 5189m.

§ 5185. Struck jury. How and when demanded and
selected. How selected in Hamilton county. Any party
to an action may demand a struck jury for the trial of
an issue of fact therein, by filing a precipe with the
clerk; thereupon the clerk, except iu counties contain
ing cities having at the federal census of 1870, or which
may hereafter have, at any federal census a population of
two hundred thousand or more, shall proceed to the office
of the county auditor, and there take to his assistance the
county auditor and recorder in the selection of the list of
names for such jury, which three officers shall select,
from the qualified electors of the county the names of
forty persons impartial between the parties, and who,
from their intelligence and sound judgment are believed
to he well qualified to try the cause: the auditor shall
make and preserve in his office a list of names so selected ;
and the clerk without delay shall give four days'
notice to both parties, or their attorneys of record, of the
time of striking the jury, and to furnish to each at the
same time a true copy of such list. In all counties containing cities having at the federal census of 1870, or
which may hereafter have at any federal census a popu
lation of two hundred thousand or more, whenever a
struck jury shall have so as aforesaid been demanded,
the clerk shall certify the same to the presiding judge
of the court in which said cause is pending ; and said
presiding judge shall thereupon, personally, and with
out suggestion from any one, perform the duty of select
ing the names of persons for such jury, in lieu of the
clerk, auditor, and recorder ; and within two days after
receiving such certificate of the clerk notifying him of
such demand for a struck jury, said presiding judge
shall certify to said clerk the names of the persons so
selected by him, and said clerk shall thereupon proceed
to give the same notice and copy of list of names so
selected as hereinbefore provided in all cases where a
struck jury shall have been demanded. [77 v. 12; 70
v. 171, \ 15.]
The officer making up the jury is not disqualified by the fact
that he had been counsel for one of the parties, 13 O. S. 115, or
had formed and expressed an opinion as to the merits of the
case, 29 O. S. 351 ; but neither a deputy clerk of the common
pleas court, nor a deputy county auditor, can act in selecting the
names of persons for a struck jury, 35 O. S. 421. The right to a
struck jury unless waived, 9 O. 133; 23 O. S. 349, is absolute, 10
O. S. 449.
§ 5186. Striking jury, At the time designated, the
clerk shall attend at his office for the purpose of striking
the jury, when the party demanding the jury, or his
agent or attorney, shall strike off one name from the list,
and the opposite party, his agent or attorney, another,
and so on alternately until each shall have struck off
twelve ; if either party fail or refuse to attend or strike,
in person or otherwise, the clerk shall strike for him ;
when twenty-four names have been stricken off, the
clerk shall make a fair copy of the remaining sixteen
names, certify them to be the list of the jurors struck
for the trial of the cause, and deliver the same to the
sheriff, or other proper officer, together with the venire ;
and such officer shall annex the names therein contained
to the venire, and summon the persons named as com
manded. [70 v. 171, 1 15,]
§ 5187. How jury made up on the trial. Upon the
trial of the cause, the names of the jurors shall be called as they stand upon the panel, which order must
be the same as that of the list at the time of striking the
jury, and the first twelve of those who appear, and are
not challenged for cause, or set aside by the court, shall
be the jury, and shall be sworn as such; but if a jury
be not made from such sixteen jurors, the sheriff shall,
under the direction of the court, fill up the panel from
the bystanders, or, on motion of either party, the court
shall select the persons to fill the panel, and issue a
special venire therefore, returnable forthwith. [70 v.
171, 1 15.]
No right to peremptory challenge, 28 O. S. 595 (S. & S. 407): see
7 O. S. 155.
§ 5188. When court may appoint person to act in place
of officer. If the clerk, auditor, or recorder, is inter
ested in the cause, sick, absent from the county, related
to either of the parties, or does not stand indifferent
between them, a judge entitled to hold such court may,
in term time or vacation, appoint soa:e judicious, dis
interested person to take the place of the officer so dis
qualified, in selecting and striking the jury, and to do
and perform all things required to be done by such
officer when acting in that behalf; but it shall not be
necessary to strike such jury more than six days pre
vious to the sitting of the court at which the cause is to
be tried ; and three days' service of the venire shall be
sufficient. [70 v. 171, § 16.]
35 O. S. 421.
§ 5189. Cost of struck jury and continuance. The
party who requires a struck jury shall pay the fees for
striking, summoning, empaneling, and qualifying the
same, and one-half of all the fees of such jury; and a
jury struck as aforesaid may be continued with the
continuance of the cause, and be required to appear as
jurors for the trial thereof at a subsequent term, unless
the court otherwise order, upon good cause shown. [70
v. 172, \ 17.]
§ 5189a. Commissioners of Hamilton, Cuyahoga, and
Franklin counties to provide jury wheel. The county
commissioners of each county having a city of the first
or second grade of the first class, or the first grade of the
second class, shall provide and place in the custody of the clerk of such county a wheel, so constructed and
arranged that, by turning the same the pieces of paper
hereinafter mentioned may be thoroughly mixed, and
that the names upon such pieces of paper can not be
read or seen until withdrawn from such wheel. [84 v.
93; 78 v. 95.]
§ 5189b. Commissioners of juries in the counties of
Hamilton and Franklin. Oath. Meeting. Selection of
jurors. In any county containing a city of the first
grade of the first class, or the first grade of the sec
ond class, before the second Monday of May of each
year, the judges of the court of common pleas, and of
the superior court, in any county containing a city of
the first class, in joint session, and the judges of the
court of common pleas in any county containing a city
of the first grade of the second class, shall appoint three
electors of such county, no one of whom shall be an
attorney at law, to be commissioners of juries for such
county; and a record of such appointment shall be
made upon the journal of each of said courts. Such
commissioners shall, before entering upon the discharge
of their duties, appear in said court of common pleas,

fully discharge the dutiesof commissioner of juries without fear
or favor, and that I will consent to the selection of no person as
juror whom 1 have been solicited to name as juror, or whom I
believe to be unfit for that position, or likely to render a partial
verdict in any cause in which he may be called as juror. And
this 1 do as I shall auswer unto God/' (or, "and this 1 do under
thepains and penalties of perjury").

ively holding the office of clerk of the court of common
pleas, county treasurer, and county auditor, shall meet
in the office of the auditor of such county, at ten o'clock
in the forenoon, and shall there select such number of
judicious and discreet persons, having the qualifications
of electors, of such county, as the court may direct, to
be selected as nearly as may be from the several wards
and townships in proportion to their respective popula
tion ; but no person shall be so selected who shall not
be, in the judgment of all of said commissioners, or said
officers, competent in every respect to serve as a juror;
that after said commissioners or said officers shall have
first ascertained said wheel to be entirely empty, the
names of the persons so selected, as afuresaid, shall be
written by the county clerk on separate pieces of paper,
which shall be put into said wheel, and securely locked
therein in the presence of said commissioners, or said
officers; and said commissioners, or said officers, shall
also, at the same time, make and sign a certificate con
taining all of said names, which they shall certify to be
the names of the persons selected at the time and place
aforesiid, to serve as jurors for the ensuing year, and
that they are the same named as those placed in said
wheel, which said certificate shall be filed with said
clerk. Said wheel shall be securely locked at all times,
except when, by order of court, it shall be necessary to
put names into it, or to draw them from it, in the manner
herein provided; and said clerk shall be the custodian
of said wheel and key. And if any person shall unlock
or open said wheel, except by order of court, he shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, on convic
tion thereof, be fined not more than one thousand dollars,
nor less than five hundred dollars, and be imprisoned in
the county jail not more than one year, nor less than
three months. If either of the commissioners, or the
officers mentioned in this section of this act, shall be
sick or absent from the county, any judge of the court
of common pleas may appoint some judicious and disin
terested person to take the place of such commissioner
or officer, in making the selection herein provided for;
whenever it shall become necessary, said commissioners,
or said officers, shall meet at such time and place as the
court of common pleas may appoint, and shall there
select such number of persons as the said court may, by
its order direct; and the names of such persons shall be
selected, written, and deposited in said wheel, and certi
fied, to as hereinbefore specified. But nothing herein
contained shall abridge the right of any party to a struck
jury as provided by law. [84 v. 93 ; 78 v. 134.]
§ 518913. Compensation of commissioners in Hamilton
County. The commissioners of juries in the county of
Hamilton, shall receive three dollars for each and every
day they are engaged in selecting jurors under the provisions of said \ 5189a, out of the county treasury, upon
the order of the county auditor, on the certificate of three
of the judges of the court of common pleas, as to the
number of days actually thus employed ; provided they
are not engaged more than two weeks in any one year.
[82 v. 3.]
§ 5189c. Penalty for influencing commissioners in selec
tion of juries. "Whoever attempts, by request, hint or
suggestion, to influence such commissioners, or such
officers, or any of them, to select, or not to select him
self, or any other person or persons as aforesaid, shall
be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or im
prisoned in the county jail not more than twenty days,
or both. [84 v. 93, 94; 78 v. 96.]
§ 5189d. How grand and petit jurors drawn, and venire
issued. Whenever the clerk of any county shall be
directed by the order of any court of record therein, or
any judge in vacation, to cause any number of persons
to be summoned to serve as grand or petit jurors in such
court, he shall at once, in the presence of the sheriff,
and the court, or a judge thereof, proceed to turn said
wheel until said pieces of paper are thoroughly mixed,
and shall then draw therefrom the number of names
specified in such order, and shall forthwith, unless other
wise directed by said court or judge, issue a venire
facias to the sheriff, commanding him to summon the
jurors whose names were so drawn, to attend as jurors at
the time and place specified in said order, and all grand
and petit juries shall be empaneled from persons so
selected and summoned as aforesaid. [78 v. 96.]
This section does not repeal the provisions of 7267-7275, or
affect them otherwise than in substituting the wheel in place of
the box. 38 O. S. 153.
§ 5189e. How jurors to be summoned. Sheriffs return.
The sheriff receiving such cenire facias shall forthwith
summon such persons by reading the same in their pres
ence, or by leaving at their usual place of abode a note or

, A. D.
, at ten o'clock A. M., to serve as

names of the jurors, and the time when summoned, and return the same to the clerk of said court on the firet
day of its session. [78 v. 96.]
§ 51891 Challenge for canse. Peremptory challenge.
If there shall be empaneled for the trial of any case,
any petit juror who has been convicted of any crime,
which by law renders him disqualified to serve on a
jury, or who has an interest in the cause, or who has an
action depending between him and either party, or who
has formerly been a juror in the same cause, or who is
either party's employer, employe, counselor, agent, stew
ard, or attorney, or who is subpoenaed in good faith in the
cause as a witness, or who is akin to either party, or to
his attorney, or who is a party to another action then
pending in any court in which any attorney in the cause
then on trial, is an attorney either for or against him,
he may be challenged for cause, and in either of said
cases, the same shall be considered as a principal chal
lenge, and the validity thereof tried by the court ; and
any petit juror who shall be returned for the trial of any
cause, and against whom no principal cause of challenge
can be alleged, may, nevertheless, be challenged on the
ground of prejudice against, or partiality for either
party, or for want
English language, or any other cause that may render
him, at the time, an unsuitable j uror, and the validity
of such challenge shall be determined by the court, and
each party mav peremptorily challenge two jurors.
[78 v. 97.]
See U 5176, 5177, 7278.
§ 5189g. Bepealed March 13, 1884 ; 81 v. 43.
§ 5189h. When the sheriff and coroner interested. When
the sheriff is interested in any cause in any court of
record, the party in interest opposed to that of the
sheriff,may apply to the court, which, upon such appli
cation, shall direct a special cenire facias to the coroner
of the county, commanding him to summon a jury
having the qualifications hereinbefore prescribed, to try
such cause, and where both the sheriff and coroner are
interested as aforesaid, or in case of death, resignation,
or absence from the county of both sheriff and coroner,
then, and in either of such cases, the process may be
directed to such discreet, disinterested person as the
court may name, and the service and return of such person shall be valid to all intents and purposes. [78
v. 97.]
§ 51891. Jury may view place or property. The court,
when of opinion it is proper for the jurors to have a view
of the property, which is the subject of litigation, or of
the place in which any material fact occurred, may
order them to be conducted in a body under the charge
of an officer to the place, which shall be shown them by
a person appointed by the court for that purpose ; and
while the jurors are thus absent, no person other than
the person so appointed shall speak to them on any sub
ject connected with the trial. [78 v. 97.]
§ 5189j. Penalty when juror refuses to serve. If any
person summoned as a juror, shall, without reasonable or
lawful cause, to be judged of by the court, refuse to
serve, he shall be fined in any sum not exceeding thirty

so assessed may be collected by execution, and shall be
paid into the county treasury and disbursed as other

§ 5189k. No person required to serve as juror more
than three weeks in any year. No person shall be re
quired to serve as a juror more than three weeks in any
one year, beginning with the last Monday of April ; and
after any person shall have served two weeks in any
such year, the court shall, on motion, discharge him from
further service ; provided, however, that nothing herein
contained shall entitle or require any juror to be dis
charged from the grand jury during its session, or from
a petit jury during the trial of a cause; and, provided
further, that all courts shall so arrange and conduct the
witnesses as to require the attendance of jurors upon its
business during as short a time as possible. [78 v. 98.]
§ 5179.
§ 51891. Who exempt from jury service. Active mem
bers of fire engine companies, hook and ladder compa
nies, or other companies for the extinguishment of fires,
during the time they may continue such active members; active and contributing members of all military compa

sicians, attorneys at law, and all public officers, while in
office, shall be exempt from serving on juries. [78 v. 98.]
See I 5180.
§ 5189m. Fees of jurors. Each grand and petit juror
shall be allowed the sum of two dollars per day for each
and every day he may serve, and five cents per mile
from his place of residence to the county seat, and the
compensation of such juror shall be certified by the clerk
of the court, and the compensation so certified shall be
paid bv the county treasurer on the order of the county
auditor. [78 v. 98,]
§5190. Mode of conducting trial. When the jury is
sworn, the trial shall proceed, except as provided in the
next section, in the following order, unless the court for
special reasons otherwise direct:
1. The plaintifff must briefly state his claim, and may
briefly state the evidence by which he expects to sus
tain it.
2. The defendant must then briefly state his defense,
and may briefly state the evidence he expects to offer in
support of it.
3. The party who would be defeated if no evidence
were offered on either side, must first produce his evi
dence; and the adverse party must then produce his
evidence.
4. The parties shall then be confined to rebutting evi
dence, unless the court, for good reasons, in the further
ance of justice, permit them to offer evidence in their
original case.
5. When the evidence is concluded, either party may
request instruction to the jury on matters of law, which
shall be given or refused by the court.
6. The parties may then submit or argue the case to
the jury ; the party required first to produce his evidence
shall have the opening and closing argument; and if
several defendants, having separate defenses, appear by
different counsel, the court shall arrange their relative
order.
7. The court, after the argument is concluded, shall,
before proceeding with other business, charge the j ury ;
any charge shall be reduced to writing by the court, if
either party, before the argument to the jury is com
menced, request it ; a charge or instruction, when so
written and given, shall not be orally qualified, modi
fied, or in any manner explained to the jury by the
court; and all written charges and instructions shall be
taken by the jurors in their retirement, and returned
with their verdict into court, and shall remain on file
with the papers of the case. [65 v. 190, § 266 ; S. & S.
552.]
See § 7300 criminal code.
3. Upon the trial of issues of fact, the general rule is that the
burden of proof rests upon the person holding the affirmatice; and
this is especially so where, from the nature of the case, the facts
alleged must be peculiarly within his own knowledge, 16 O. S.
88. The discretion ordinarily conceded counsel to pursue their
own order in the production of proof so that its relevancy is
made manifest during the investigation, must bo limited to cases
where the fact subsequently to be made relevant is itself estab
lished by competent testimony, 11 O. S. 470. Where, In an action
to recover damages for an assault and battery, the defendant
justifies on the ground of self-defense, it is not error for the
court to permit the plaintifff to open and close the case, SI O. S.
192; but where an issue was joined on an answer justifying the
alleged trespass, and the court allowed defendant to begin and
close in offering testimony and in the argument, it was held that
unless it affirmatively appeared that special reasons did not
exist which would authorize the court to change the order of
proceeding at the trial, or that the plaintifff was prejudiced
thereby, a judgment for the defendant would not be reversed, 37
O. S. 415. lu will contests, § 5864.
4. A party upon whom the affirmatice, of an issue devolves is
bound to give all his evidence in support of the issue in the first
instance, and he can only give such evidence in reply as tends
to answer the new matter introduced by his adversary, 4 O. S.
362. But judgment will not be reversed for permitting evidence
in the original case to be offered under such circumstances, un
less it affirmatively appear* that good reasons in furtherance of
justice were not shown, 21 O. S. 155. The allowance of evidence
to be introduced out of its order rests in the sound discretion of
the court, reviewable on error only where an abuse of such dis
cretion is shown, 29 O. S. 351.
5. Instructions. It is error for the court to omit to charge upon
a material point on the request of a party. 33 O. S 506 ; to annex
to a charge properly asked a material qualification not required
or authorized by the evidence, 10 O. S. 14; 14 O. S. 89; to refuse
to reduce its charge to writing on points of law, 9 O. S. (act 1845 ;
see subdivision 7 ; 23 O. S. 146) ; to refuse to give a true hypo
thetical proposition, leaving to the jury to say whether the facts
existed, 22 O. H. 554 ; f o refuse to charge that contributory negli
gence defeats plaintifff's case, 24 O. S. 119. To constitute error in the refusal of the court to charge the jury as requested, the
proposition requested and refused must be absolutely true un
der all reasonably conceivable circumstances, 10 O. 438, 452; 34
O. S. 127, 133. The court is uot bound to give or refuse a chnrge
in the language of counsel, however sound in law or pertinent
to the case the proposition may be. but may select its own lan
guage, 42 O. S. 154. 1t is n ,t error to refuse to charge an abstract
proposition of law, 17 O. S. 461; or a proposition not appearing
to be involved in the case, 17 O. S. 193; 15 O.156; 4 O. 380; 30O.
S. 480 ; 20 O. S. 391 ; 6 Neb. 41S; or to refuse to give an ambigu
ous and self-contradictory charge, 19 O.S. 356; or to refuse to
charge a series of connected propositions, some of which are law
and some not, 2 O. S. 593 ; ID O. 837 ; or to refuse to give a charge
which, if granted, would not aid the party asking it, 1 O. S. 244;
nor is it error to refuse to give a charge already substantially
given, 23 O. S. 310; 1 Neb. 120; or to refuse a charge which re
quires the court to assume the existence of material facta in
issue, however clearly proven, 24 O. S.670; or to refuse a charge,
though correct law and applicable to the case, if it has the effect
of withdrawing material testimony from the jury, 9 Neb. 72 ; or
to refuse to repeat an erroneous special charge, 38 O. S. 97; to
refuse a charge where there is a special finding, "which shows
the party was not injured, 32 O. 9. 225; or to refuse to give a
written charge which the party is not entitled to have given in
the terms in which it is expressed, 43 O. S. 270; or to refuse to
charge upon a false hypothetical case, 24 O. S. 631 ; 10 O. 324.
6. While the general rule is that a party holding the affirma
tice of an issue has the opening and cloning oi the argument, 16 O.
324 ; 32 O. S. 224, where the trial is to the court and not to the
jury, 1 C. C. R. 76, or where there is a complicated state of plead
ing, 32 O. S. 224, or where special reasons exist, 37 O. S. 415, the
court is vested with a liberal discretion in changing the order
of proceeding, Id. Where plaintifff had opened with the testi
mony without objection, he will be permitted to open with the
argument, though the defendant might have been defeated, if
no evidence had been offered on either side, 11 O. S. 339-347;
and where opposing counsel decline to reply, the party holding
the affirmative is not permitted to address the jury a second
time, 1 O. 60. In will contests, the party sustaining the will
has the opening and closing of the argument, § 5864. In pro
ceedings to appropriate private property by corporations, the
land owner has the affirmative, g 6422; in such proceedings by
cities and villages the land owner has the opening and closing
in the introduction of the evidence and in the argument, § 2215.
Formerly, it seems, the city had that right, 32 O. 8. 215, and the
state, S. '& C. 1255, in proceedings to appropriate lands for pub
lic works. In libel or assault and battery on a plea of instification or self defense, the plaintifff has the opening and closing,
31 O. S. 102; but where special reasons exist, and in the absence
of anything in the record to the contrary, special reasons are
presumed, it is not error for the court to permit the defendant
to open and close in such case, 37 O. S. 415, 410. In an action
for trie recovery of damages, for an alleged wrongful conversion
of goods to which the plaintifff claims title, where the defendant
answers simply alleging fraud in the assignment under which
plaintifff claims, the plaintifff is entitled to open and close, 13
O. S. 115. Id an action on a promissory note where the answer
pleads payment, and issue is taken on that plea alone, the
defendant is entitled to open and close, 25 O. S. 276. In quo
warranto, for usurpiDg the franchise to be a body corporate,
defendants are entitled to open and close, 37 O. S. 631. Au aver
ment in answer to a petition upon contract of a material stipu
lation, in addition to what is set forth in the petition as the
contract, amounts, at most, only to a denial of the contract
set forth, and does not entitle defendant to open and close,
12 Bull 77.
7. Charging jury. It is error for the court to give oral instruc
tions in addition to a written charge, 40 O. S. 430; to charge a
jury as to the costs recoverable in a case, 11 O. S. 457 ; to re-in
struct a jury in the enforced absence of the defendant, 26 O. S.
208; to repeat a charge in the absence of defendant in error,
2 O. S. 54 ; to give a charge tending to confuse or mislead the
jury, 5 O. S. 450; 12 O. S. 312, though not in the abstract erro
neous, 19 O. S. 110; to privately explain a charge to the jury,
14 O. 511 ; 8 O. S. 210 ; to give a charge consisting of extracts
from opinions, with no special reference to the facts of the case,
24 O. S. 654; to instruct the jury how to find facts or assume
their existence, 43 O. S. 333 ; to givo an erroneous charge, after
wards qualifying it by apt words, if it is uncertain what the
rule given or intended to be given really was, 22 O. S. 1 ; to di
rect the jury to find for the defendant, when evidence has been
offered by both parties, 18 O. 323; see 1 C. C. R. 9, 11; but if
there is an entire failure of proof on ony part of the case essen
tial to the plaintifff's right to recover, it is the duty of the court
to arrest thetestimonyfrom the jury, and render judgment for the
defendant, 24 O. S. 83. Judgment will not be reversed for error
in charging an abstract proposition of law unless misleading,
2 O. S. 44 ; 19 O. S. 157 ; 20 O. S. 391 ; 21 O. S. 98 ; for error in a charge
where it is plain no other judgment can be rendered, 37 O. B.
49; for an omission to give an instruction, unless such instruc
tion is requested, 15 O. 123 ; 20 O. 84 ; 22 O. S. 808 ; 23 O. S. 10 ;
for failure to construe a contract when not requested, 13 O. S.
235; or to explain doubtful words of a statute, 21 O. S. 98. It is
not error to give a true hypothetical proposition, founded upon
extraneous facts, 2 O. S. 562 ; to add a verbal remark after a
written charge, and then put the remark in writing, 33 O. S. 429 ;
to give an erroneous special charge, and decline to repeat It,
38 O. S. 97 ; to direct the jury to find for a party, in case they
find certain facts, 33 O. S. 329. Judgment will not be reversed
because the court stated general propositions of law not In
volved in the issues, if it appeared from the whole charge that
the jury could not have been misled, 21 O. S. 98; 28 O. S. 144;
31 O. S. 219 ; for error in a charge as to one of the issues, where
the verdict is in favor of the successful party on all the issues,
and on either issue he is entitled to judgment, 23 O. S. 626. The
court is not bound to reduce its charge to writing unless re
quested before argument, nor to read it until after the argu
ment, 23 O. S. 146. An objection, that the court delivered the
charge in manuscript to the jury without reading it, if available
at all, must be taken at the time, 22 O. S. 324. The presumption
is that a proper charge was given until the contrary appears,
26 O. S. 371 ; see 2 C. C. R. 247 ; 21 Bull 319 ; 8 C. C. B. 805.
§ 5191. When jury may view place or property. The
court, when of opinion it is proper for the jurors to have
a view of the property which is the subject of litigation,
or of the place in which any material fact occurred,
may order them to be conducted in a body, under the
charge of an officer, to the place, which shall be shown
to them by a person appointed by the court for that pur
pose; and while the jurors are thus absent, no person,
other than the person so appointed, shall speak to them
on any subject connected with the trial. [51 v. 57,
§ 267 ; S. & C. 1023.] See 19 Bull 258.
§ 5192. Jury may decide in court, or retire for delibera
tion in custody of officer. When the case is submitted,
the jury may decide in court, or retire for deliberation;
if the jurors retire, they must be kept together in some
convenient place, under the charge of an officer, until
they agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by the court,
subject to the discretion of the court, to permit them to
separate temporarily at night, and at their meals ; the
officer having them under his charge shall not suffer any
communication to be made to them, nor make any him
self, except to ask them if they have agreed upon their
verdict, unless by order of the court ; and he shall not,
before their verdict is rendered, communicate to any
person the state of their deliberations, or the verdict
agreed upon. [51 v. 57, \ 268 ; S. & C. 1023.]
See I 6305, notes.
§ 5193. Admonition, if jurors permitted to separate.
If the jurors be permitted to separate, either during the
trial, or after the case is submitted to them, they shall be
admonished by the court that it is their duty not to con
verse with, nor suffer themselves to be addressed by, any
other person, on any subject of the trial, and that it is
their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon,
until the cause is finally submitted to them. [51 v. 57,
§ 269 ; S. & C. 1023.]
The court is not required to repeat an admonition, 2 C. S. C. B.
132. Waiver by failure to except, see 12 Bull 197.
§ 5194. Further instructions when jurors disagree.
After the jurors have retired for deliberation, if there be
a disagreement between them as to any part of the tes
timony, or if they desire to be informed as to any part of the law arising in the case, they may request the
officer to conduct them to the court, where the in
formation upon the matter of law shall be given ; and
the court may give its recollection as to the testimony
on the point in dispute, in the presence of, or after
notice to, the parties or their counsel. [51 v. 57, § 270 ;
S. & C. 1024.]
The section is applicable to criminal as well as to civil cases,
35 O. S. 421. It is error for a judge, during a recess of his court,
and in the absence of the party and his counsel, and without
notice to them, to give instructions to the jury, to whom the case
has been submitted, 8 O. S. 211 ; but where the parties and their
counsel, being called or sent for, fail to attend, it is not error for
the court further to instruct the jury in their absence, 13 O. S. 1 ;
see 1 D. 327 ; Id. 512 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 36.
§ 5195. Discharge of jury before verdict. The jury
may be discharged by the court on account of the sick
ness of a juror, or any accident or calamity requiring its
discharge, or by consent of both parties, or after the
jurors have been kept together until it satisfactorily apfiears that there is no probability of their agreeing.
51 v. 57, \ 271 ; S. & C. 1024.]
Errors waived when jury discharged by consent, 1 O. S. 386.
§ 5196. When oause to be retried. When the jury is
discharged after the cause is submitted, or during the
trial, the cause may be tried again immediately, or at a
future time, as the court may direct. [51 v. 57, § 272;
S. & C. 1024.]
§ 5197. Beturn of verdiot. When the jurors agree
upon their verdict, it must be reduced to writing, and
signed by the foreman ; they must then be conducted
into court, their names called by the clerk, and the ver
dict rendered by the foreman; and the clerk must read
the verdict to the jury, and make inquiry whether it is
their verdict. [51 v. 57, $ 273, 274; S. & C. 1024.]
That a verdict was not in writing was held not ground for a
new trial under the criminal code, 19 O. S. 579.
§ 5198. When jury must be sent out again for further
deliberation. If a juror disagree, or if, when the jury is
polled, a juror answer in the negative, or if the verdict
is defective in matter of substance, the jury must be
sent out again, for further deliberation ; and either
party may require the jury to be polled, which shall be
§ 5199. Discharge. When verdiot corrected. If no
disagreement be expressed, and neither narty require
the jury to be polled, or, on the polling, each juror answer
in the affirmative, the verdict is complete, and the jury
shall be discharged from the case; and if the verdict
be defective in form only, it may, with the assent of the
jurors, before they are discharged, be corrected by the
court. [51 v. 57, \\ 273, 274 ; S. & C. 1024.]
And under the former practice, 2 O. 31 ; 3 O. 384 ; W. 645; aee
2 C. S. C. R. 132 ; but not by a court ol error, 5 O. 228 : 9 O. 131 ;
nor after the verdict is received and the jury discharged, 11 O.472.
§ 5200. Special and general verdiot. The verdict of a
jury must be either general or special ; a general verdict
is that by which the jury finds, generally, upon all or
any of the issues, in favor of either the plaintifff or
defendant; a special verdict is that by which the jury
finds the facts only, and it must present the facte as
established by the evidence, and not the evidence to
prove the facts; and the facts must be bo presented that
nothing shall remain to the court but to draw from them
conclusions of law. [51 v. 57, I 27o ; S. & C. 1024.]
Upon the trial of an issue of fact, a special verdict should
find facts to which the law gives a determinate effect, conclusive
of the issue; and no judgment can be rendered on findings of
facts which are in the nature of evidence only, and are not in
law conclusive upon the questions at issue, 10 O. S. 118 ; see 20
O. 168, 281 ; 12 O. S. 175 ; see 45 O. 8. 491.
§ 5201. When jury may render general or special ver
diot. In actions for the recovery of money only, or spe
cific real property, the jury may render either a general
or a special verdict; in all other cases the court may
direct the jury to find a special verdict, in writing, upon
all or any of the issues; in all cases the court may
instruct the jurors, if they render a general verdict, to
find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in
writing, and may direct a written finding thereon ; and
the verdict or finding must be filed with the clerk and
entered on the journal. [51 v. 57, § 276 ; S. & C. 1025.]
The right of the court to direct, 8 O. S. 570, and of the jury
to render a special verdict, discretionary, 12 0. S. 618.
§ 5202. Special findings control general verdict. When
the special finding of facts is inconsistent with the gen
eral verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the
court may give judgment accordingly. [51 v. 57, § 277 ;
S. & C. 1026.]
28 O. S. 200 ; 33 O. S. 246; 2C.C.R. 56; Id. 366; 8 Kas. 068 ; 6
Abb. n. s. 251 ; 13 Barb. 153 ; 19 Bull '201, 214 ; 45 O. S. 471.
§ 5203. When jury must assess amount of recovery.
When, by the verdict, either party is entitled to recover
money of the adverse party, the jury, in its verdict,
must assess the amount of recovery. [51 v. 57, § 278;
S. & C. 1026.]
But if the language of the verdict i.' such that, when read in
connection with the record, the amount assessed for the plaintifff
can not be ascertained without reference to the evidence offered
on the trial, no judgment can properly be entered on the ver
dict, 33 O. S. 52.
SUBDIVISION m. TRIAL BY THE COURT.
§ 5204. Waiver of trial by jury. In actions arising
on contract, the trial by jury may be waived by the
parties, and in other actions with the assent of the
court, in the following manner :
1. By the consent of the party appearing, when the
other party fails to appear at the trial, by himself or
attorney.
2. By written consent, in person or by attorney, filed
with the clerk.
3. By oral consent in open court, entered on the jour
nal. [51 v. 57, § 279 ; S. & C. 1026.]
2 Clev. Rep. 114. And a party waives his right to a jury
where he suffers his case to be tried without objection until after
the issues are found against him, 17 O. S. 72; and where a case is
regularly set down for trial on submission for several terms, and
both parties prepare to try it, this is a waiver of a jury trial, 1 C.
S. C. R. 164 ; but up to the time of trial either party may appear
and demand a jury, 1 Bull 110. Where a case triable by jury has
been set in a submitted room, and no notice of its setting is
given to the opposite counsel, it is error in the court to render
judgment by submission, 9 Bull 308. Where judgment is ren
dered on default in an action on an account, there is no error for
which the judgment will be reversed, 25 O. S. 635.
§ 5205. What the court must state in its findings.
Upon the trial of questions of fact by the court, it shall
not be necessary for the court to state its finding, except,
generally, for the plaintifff or defendant, unless one of the parties request it, with the view of excepting to the
decision of the court upon the questions of law involved
in the trial, in which case the court shall state in writing
the conclusions of fact found, separately from the con
clusions of law. [51 v. 57, § 280 ; S. & C. 1026.]
If the court refuse the request of a party to make such special
finding, the judgment against him will be reversed, unless it
clearly appears that he was not prejudiced thereby, 38 O. S. 87 ;
but if the party makes no request for a finding under this sec
tion, and an issue is found against him, he can not stand by
when the journal entry is made, make no objection to its form
or entry, and afterwards avail himself of inconsistencies in the
statement of the steps by which the court reached its conclu
sions, 12 O. S. 1 ; and if a party, at the time, makes no objection
to the sufficiency of the facts found, he must submit to such
judgment as the facts found require, 38 O. S. 416. When the
court, being requested to state separately its conclusions of law
and fact, makes a sufficient finding of the facts and renders a
final judgment thereon, the judgment itself is to be regarded as
a statement of the court's conclusions of law, within the mean
ing of this section, 22 O. S. 38. When such finding of facts is im
perfect, in that it is too general in its terms and does not specif
ically find the facts in issue, but is not excepted to on that
ground, and the record shows that it is sustained by the evi
dence, judgment will not be reversed for the" defect, Id.; nor be
cause the court erred in its statement of the law applicable to a
state of facts not found by the court or shown by the evidence,
if it sufficiently appears from the record that the judgment was
warranted by the facts so found and by the evidence, Id. The
iacts found must be sufficient in themselves to authorize the
judgment rendered, 35 O. S. 620; and if the finding of facts ad
mits of a construction which will support the judgment, that
construction will be adopted, 25 O. S. 255; but such finding
must contain the facts to which the law gives a determinate
effect, conclusive upon the issue, 10 O. S. 148. When a fact is
admitted by the pleadings, and no evidence offered to disprove
it, it is error for the court, when special findings are requested
under this section, to state the facts contrary to such admission,
23 O. S. 473. If the court make a special finding of facts and ren
der judgment thereon, the same may be reviewed on error,
though not made at the request of either party, 35 O. S. 113.
Where a motion for a new trial, on the ground that such special
findings are contrary to the evidence, has been overruled and
exceptions taken, and the whole testimony embodied in a bill of
exceptions, the reviewing court, having found the error com
plained of to exist, will look into the whole record to ascertain
whether the error was prejudicial to the party, 23 O. S. 473.
While the opinion of the court in deciding a case may be in
such terms as to constitute a finding of facts under this section,
yet the practice of making an opinion a substitute for such find
ing is irregular ; and where the law and facts are blended, the
opinion will not be regarded as a substantial compliance with
this section, 31 O. S. 650 ; 34 O. s. 442 ; see 19 Bull 121.
§ 5206. Provisions applicable to trial by oourt. The provisions of this chapter respecting trials by jury shall
apply, so far as they are in their nature applicable, to
trials by the court. [51 v. 57, § 303 ; S. & C. 1034.]
§ 5207. Trial of agreed cases by the court. Parties to
a question which might be the subject of a civil action,
may, without action, agree upon a case containing the
facts upon which the controversy depends, and present a
submission of the same to any court which would have
jurisdiction if an action were brought; but it must ap
pear by affidavit that the controversy is real, and the
proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights of the
parties; and the court shall, thereupon, hear and deter
mine the case, and render judgment, as if an action were
pending. [51 v. 57, § 495 ; S. & C. 1094.]
The case submitted must be an agreed statement of facts
which might be the subject of a civil action, and upon which a
judgment maybe rendered as if an action were pending thereon,
80 O. S. 120; see 2 Bull 81 ; 6 Rec. 73 ; and where a case submit
ted under this section merely propounds questions of law, with
out an agreed statement of facts on which a judgment can be
rendered, the court should dismiss the cause without judgment
and without costs, Id. A motion for a uew trial, or a bill of ex
ceptions, is not required in proceedings in error under this sec
tion, 22 O. S. 149. This provision affords a speedy method of
obtaining the construction of a will, Yaple's Pr., etc., 517.
§ 5208. Becord in agreed case. The case, the submis
sion, and the judgment, shall constitute the record. [51
v. 57, §496; S.&C.1095.]
§ 5209. Judgment. Reversal. The judgment shall
be with costs, may be enforced, and shall be subject to
reversal, in the same manner as if it had been rendered
in an action, unless otherwise provided in the submis
sion. [51 v. 57, § 497 ; S. & C. 1095.]
SUBDIVISION IV. TRIAL BY REFEREES.
§ 5210. All issues may he referred by consent. All or
any of the issues in the action or proceeding, whether
of fact or of law, or both, may be referred by the court,
or a judge thereof in vacation, upon the written consent
of the parties, or upon their oral consent in court,
entered upon the journal. [51 v. 57, \ 281 ; 69 v. 109,
§287; S. & C. 1027.]
See 7 O. (Pt. 2) 62 ; 22 O. S. 372 ; 1 Kas. 324 ; 3 Id. 18 ; 4 Id. 319 ;
3 Neb. 94 ; 5 Id. 154. Consent will be presumed when the record
fails to show that objections were made to the reference, 6 Neb.
382. Where the reference was made on motion of the defendant. he can not object that there was no agreement to refer, 25 O. 8.
567. An appeal vacated the report under former statutes, 7 O. S.
129; 25 O. S. 402.
§ 5311. When the oourt may order a reference with
out oonsent. When the parties do not consent, the court,
or a judge thereof in vacation, may, upon the applica
tion of a party, or of its or his motion, direct a refer
ence in any case in which the parties are not entitled by
the constitution to a trial by jury. [54 v. 92, § 282; 69
v. 109, §287; S.&C.1027.]
§ 5212. Reference in vacation. If a referee die, or be
disabled, or refuse to serve, a judge of the court in which
the action is pending may, in vacation, appoint another
person to take his place, or again direct a reference as
provided in the two preceding sections. [69 v. 109, ? 287.]
§ 5213. Trial before referee. Report, exceptions, and
judgment. The trial by referees shall be cond ucted in the
same manner as a trial by the court (1 ); referees may sum
mon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, administer
all necessary oaths in the trial of the case, and grant
adjournments, the same as the court; they must state the
facts found, and the conclusions of law, separately (2), and
their decision must be given, and may be excepted to and
reviewed, in like manner (3); their report upon the
whole issue shall stand as the decision of the court, and
judgment (4) may be entered thereon in the same manner
as if the action had been tried by the court; when the
reference is to report the facts, the report shall have the
effect of a special verdict (5); and, when the court di
rects it to be done, the referee shall reduce the testimony
of the witnesses to writing, and require them severally
to subscribe the same. [51 v. 57, \ 283 ; 64 v. 144, \ 1 ;
S.&C.1027; S.&S.579.]
1. 7 O. S. 129; 1 Clev. R. 226: 2 Id. 9. Submission to the re
port is a waiver of a jury, 22 O. S. 372. The evidence need not be
reduced to writing, 7 O. S. 129. Amended or supplemental
pleadings may be filed during the progress of the cause before
the referee. 33 O. S. 336-3r,6. 2. 1 C. S. C. R. 241. 3. 33 O. S. 336;
7 O. S. 129, 132 ; 2 Clev. R. 9. Motion for new trial must be made
before referee, 1 C. S. C. R. 341. Motion to confirm report waives
exceptions, 9 Rec. 550. Order refusing to set aside not appeal
able, 26 O. S. 439 ; 33 Id. 336. 4. Without motion or notice, 1 C. S.
C. R. 211, or cjntrary to the report, 41 O. S. 81. The court may, in
its discretion, order a recommittal of the report, 22 O. S. 372 ; 33
O. S. 336 ; may order referee to file a supplemental report, 33 O. S.
336; may examine the testimony, 2 Bull 33; but if no exception
Is taken to the competency and relevancy of testimony at the
time it was offered, and properly noted, and if the referee was
not required to state the facts found and conclusions of law sepa
rately, the report can not be re-examined, 3 W. L. G 251 ; 2 D.

§ 5226. When an appeal may be taken. In addition to
the cases and matters specially provided for, an appeal
may be taken to the circuit court, by a party or other person directly affected, from a judgment or final order
in a civil action rendered by the common pleas court,
and of which it had original jurisdiction, if the rijrht to
demand a jury therein did not exist, and from an inter
locutory order made by the common pleas court, or a
judge thereof, dissolving an injunction, in a case of
which it had original jurisdiction; but such interlocu
tory order dissolving such injunction shall not be sus
pended by the appeal, except by the order of the circuit
court, or two judges thereof in vacation, on reasonable
notice to the adverse party ; provided, that the court or
judge may, at the time of making such interlocutory
order, upon good cause shown, suspend the operation
thereof for any period not exceeding ten days, within
which period the party appealing may perfect the ap
peal. [82 v. 32 ; 80 v. 117 ; 69 v. 71, § 1; 65 v. 211, \ 5 ;

reply on which a jury trial might have been demanded, 40 O. S.
468; from a decree in an action against a mortgagor and his
grantee for foreclosure, though a personal judgment is asked
against the mortgagor for the mortgage debt, 31 O. S. 568; but
where the plaintifff demands a judgment against the defendant
for the amount due upon the mortgage, and issues of fact are
joined therein, the action is triable by j ury, and there is no an- .
peal, 23 O. S. 579; contra, where illegal interest was the only

will defeat the plaintifff's case, and issues are taken on such new
matter, 26 O. S. 514 ; from an order in partition under the stat

cause of action entitle the party to no other relief than a per
sonal judgment, though other relief was prayed for and granted,

vacate a judgment rendered by the common pleas at a former

Notice of appeal. Time of filing bond. A
party desiring to appeal his cause to the circuit court
shall, at the term at which the judgment or order is ren
dered, enter on the records notice (1) of such intention,
and, within thirty days after the rising of the court (2),
give an undertaking, with sufficient surety, to be ap
proved by the clerk (3) of the court, or a judge thereof,
as hereinafter provided. [82 v. 32 ; 54 v. 122, \ 2 ; S. & C
1162.]
1. The notice must be entered at the term, 10 O. 202, on the
journal, W. 495. Entry In the docket, 10 O. 197, or on the judge's
calendar, 1 Clev. R. 89, will not suffice. Notice handed to the
clerk at his residence is not sufficient, 2 Bull 115. Notice before
repealing act saves the appeal, 2 W. L. J. 427 ; see (i O. S. 174.
2. After regular term, 4 O. S. 469: given on the 30th sufficient,
10W. L.J. 74. 3. See W. 95; 22 O. S. 527. If no bond is given,
the court acquires no jurisdiction, and the objection can be
taken at any time, 0 O. 490.
§ 5228. Who not required to give bond. A party in
any trust capacity, who has given bond in this state, with
sureties according to law, shall not be required to give
bond and security to perfect an appeal (1) ; and in such
cases the clerk of the common pleas court, at the expi
ration of thirty days from the rising of the court, shall,
if not otherwise directed, make a transcript (2), which,
together with the papers and pleadings filed in the cause,
he shall transmit to the clerk of the circuit court, as in
other cases of appeal. [82 v. 32; 50 v. 93, \ 6; 51 v. 57,
§ 607; S.& C. 1135, 1167.]
1. 1 O. 513; W. 157; but not when he has not given official
bond in this state, W. 631 ; 6 O. 503 (see 1 Clev. R. 9 ; 5 Bull 414),
though the will under which he acts excuses him from giving
bond, 29 O. S. 433. 2. Whether an appeal is filed in time or
not, must be determined from the transcript ; the recitals of
the appeal bond can not be looked at, 17 O. S. 30.
§ 5229. When party dies before appeal is perfected.
When a party to a judgment has given notice as afore
said, and dies within the time limited for the appeal,
and before perfecting the same, the administrator or ex
ecutor of such deceased party, at any time within thirty
days after his appointment and qualification, and within
ninety days after the death of such party, may cause
notice of his intention, as such administrator or execu
tor, to appeal the cause, to be entered upon the journal
of the court ; and such administrator or executor shall
thereby be made a party to the judgment, and the ap
peal shall be considered as perfected. [54 v. 122, § 2;
§. & C. 1162.]
§ 5230. Penalty of bond. When court to fix amount.
'When the judgment is personal against a party for the
payment of money only, the penalty of the appeal bond
shall be double the amount of the judgment (1 ) ; in all
other cases, including cases in which the judgment is
against a party for nominal damages and costs, or for
costs only, the court shall, at the time of the rendition of the judgment, ascertain and fix the penalty of the
appeal bond to be given in the event of an appeal, at
such reasonable amount as will, in the opinion of the
court, be sufficient to cover the probable loss, damage, or
injury, which the other party or parties may sustain by
the delay, and the costs and damages which may be
awarded in the appellate court (2). [50 v. 93, § 3;
S. & C. 1164.]
1. The sureties must be worth, in the aggregate, beyond the
amount of their debts, double the amount of the penalty of the
bond, and not merely double the amount of the judgment,
5 Bull 711 ; fl Ree. 304. The bond must be for double the amount
of the judgment, including costs, 5 O. 276, 337. 2. A refusal
or failure by the court to fix the amount of the bond does not
deprive the party of his appeal, 38 O. S. 405; 1 O. S. 171; 10
W. L. J. 495; contra, Id. 72 ; and where the court, having power
to fix the amount, placed it at a less sum than tho decree ap
pealed from, this afforded no ground for dismissing the appeal,
14 O. S. 551. Objection to the amount to be made when fixed,
W. 741 ; see 1 C. C. R. 550, 555.
§ 5231. Condition of bond. To whom payable, The
appeal bond shall be payable to the adverse party, or
otherwise, as may be directed by the court, where the
conflicting interests of the parties require it, and shall
be subject to a condition to the effect that the party ap
pealing shall abide and perform the order and judgment
of the appellate court, and shall pay all money, costs, and
damages which may be required of or awarded against
him by such court. [50 v. 93, § 3 ; S. & C. 1 1 64.]
Appellee need not be named, 13 O. S. 485 (justice's code).
§ 5232. Appeal of separate interest. When the inter
est of a party desiring an appeal is separate and distinct
from that of the other party or parties, and he desires
to appeal the part of the case in which he is interested,
it shall be so allowed by the court, and the penalty and
condition of the bond shall be fixed accordingly ; and
the court shall make such order, as to the papers and
pleadings, the supplying of copies thereof, and in all
other respects, in view of a division of the case for the
purpose of appeal , as it deems right and proper. [50 v.
93, H; S.&C. 1166.]
1 O. S. 202, 204 ; see 20 O. 512; 1 O. 513. One of two or more
delendants, against whom jointty a judgment has been rendered
in the common pleas, may appeal the case to the district court,
and his appeal will vacate the judgment, and take up the whole
case. To perfect the appeal in such case, it is not necessary for the appellant to give a bond that will cover the faults of his
co-defendant; it is sufficient if it cover his own, 4 O. S. 210
(Swan's Stat. 717). See 5 Bull 517.
§ 5233. Amendment or renewal of appeal bond. 'When
the surety in the undertaking for the appeal has removed
from the state, or for any cause is insufficient, or if the
undertaking is insufficient in form or amount, the cir
cuit court, on motion, may order a change or renewal of
the undertaking, or a new undertaking to he given, with
security, to he approved by the circuit court, or the clerk
thereof; and if the order of the circuit court be com
plied with, the appeal shall not be dismissed, but the
court shall hear and determine the cause in the same
manner as if the order had not been made ; but other
wise the appeal shall be dismissed. [82 v. 32 ; 54 v. 95.]
Application a "proceeding" within meaning of i 5114, 4
C. C. R. 36.
A defective bond may be amended or a new bond given, 6
O. S. 81; 28 O. S. 90, 96 (not subscribed by plaintifff); see 31 O. S.
131, 331 ; W. 164 ; 1 O. S. 171 ; 11 O. 420 ; 10 O. S. 579. If the bond
complies substantially with the requisites of the statute, it is
sufficient, 10 O. S. 579 ; 1 1 O. S. 398 ; 1 O. 170 ; see 35 O. S. 638 ; but
that which gives jurisdiction and may be amended must be a
bond, 6 O. S. 501 ; 16 O. S. 1.
§ 5234. When execution may he stayed. The court
may, on motion of the party entering notice of appeal,
on such reasonable terms as may be necessary for the
security of the adverse party, direct execution to be
stayed for thirty days. [50 v..93, § 6 ; S. & C. 1167.]
§ 5235. Suspension of judgment on appeal. When an
appeal is taken, and bond given, the judgment is thereby
suspended, unless some part of the final judgment ap
pealed from be an injunction, in which case such injunc
tion shall not be suspended, except by order of the circuit
court, or two judges thereof, on reasonable notice to the
adverse party ; and the clerk of the common pleas court
shall forthwith make an authenticated transcript of the
docket and journal entries, and of the final judgment in
the cause appealed; which transcript, together with the
original papers and pleadings, he shall deliver at the
office of the clerk of the circuit court, on or before the
first day of the term thereof next after the appeal is per
fected ; and either party may require a full record to be
made of the case in the court below, at his own costs.
[82 y. 32; 50 v. 93, § 9 ; S. & C. 1168.]
An appeal takes the whole case out of the jurisdiction of the
lower court, and after appeal the lower court has no power to
set aside its j udgment, 1 C. C. R. 479. An appeal vacates rulings
on demurrer as well as final judgment, and the appellate court
should try again the question of law made by the demurrer, as
also the issue of fact, 30 O. S. 378 ; 29 O. S. 440.
§ 5236. Lien of judgment on appeal to oircuit court
oontinues. When the party against whom a judgment
is rendered appeals his cause to the circuit court, the lien
of the opposite party on the real estate of the appellant,
created by the judgment, shall not be removed or
vacated by the appeal ; but the real estate of the appel
lant shall be bound, in the same manner as if the appeal
had not been taken, until the final determination of the
cause in the circuit court. [82 v. 32 ; 50 v. 93, § 7 ;
S. & C. 1168.]
See I 5376.
§ 5237. Costs on appeal to oironit oourt. If a plaint
iff appealing do not recover a greater sum in the circuit
court than in the court from which the appeal was
taken, exclusive of costs and interest accrued since the
rendition of the judgment, he shall pay all costs that
accrue in the circuit court ; and if the defendant, in any
personal action, appeal to the circuit court, and the
plaintifff recover the same or a larger sum than was
recovered in the court below, exclusive of costs, the cir
cuit court shall render judgment for the sum so recov
ered, with costs of suit. [82 v. 32 ; 50 v. 93, \ 8 ; S. & C.
116K.]
Under former statutes, 3 O. 72 ; 13 O. 133, 248.
§ 5238. Damages when appeal is for delay merely.
When the appellate court renders substantially the same
judgment which was rendered in the court below, dam
ages may be awarded as follows: When the judgment
is for the payment of money, the appellant shall be ad
judged to pay the appellee, or party delayed of payment
by the appeal, damages at the rate of five per cent, on
the amount adjudged in the court below, unless the
appellate court is satisfied that there was reasonable
ground for the appeal ; and in such case, when the court
is satisfied that the appeal was for the purpose of delay
merely, the damages adjudged shall be at the rate of ten
per cent.; in all other cases, including those where the judgment or decree is for nominal damages and costs, or
costs only, unless the appellate court is satisfied that
there was reasonable and probable ground for the ap
peal, damages shall be adjudged to the appellee, or party
affected by the appeal, in such specific sum as may be
deemed reasonable, not exceeding two hundred dollars.
[50 v. 93,? 5; S. & C. 1167.]
§ 5239. IKandate to common pleas. When the circuit
court makes a final order, or renders a final judgment,
in cases brought before it on appeal, it may enforce the
same by process issued therefrom, or may remand the
same to the common pleas court for execution or other
process ; the clerk of the circuit court shall certify the
same to the common pleas court, and the clerk of the
common pleas court, on receipt of the certified tran
script, shall immediately enter the same on the journal ;
and the judgment or order so entered, unless otherwise
directed by the circuit court, shall, for the purpose of
execution and other process, stand as the judgment of
the common pleas court. [82 v. 33; 67 v. 29, 1 1.]
See ?| 519, 6726. An authenticated mandate from the district
court of the judgment remanding the case to the court of com
mon pleas for further proceedings can not be impeached in the

not part of the order of the district court, but was added to the
judgment without its authority, 37 O. S. 10; see 1 C. C. R. 479

§ 5241. Privileged communications. Attorney and
olient, physician and patient, husband and wife, assignor,
etc The following persons shall not testify in certain
respects :
1. An attorney, concerning a communication made to
him by his client in that relation, or his advice to his
client; or a physician, concerning a communication
made to him by his patient in that relation, or his advice
to his patient ; but the attorney or physician may testify
by express consent of the client or patient; and if the
client or patient voluntarily testify, the attorney or
physician may be compelled to testify on the same
subject.
2. A clergyman or priest, concerning a confession
made to him in his professional character, in the course
of discipline enjoined by the church to which he belongs.
3. Husband or wife, concerning any communication
made by one to the other, or an act done by either in
the presence of the other, during coverture, unless the
communication was made, or act done, in the known
presence or hearing of a third person competent to be a
witness, and the rule shall be the same it the marital
relation has ceased to exist.
4. A person who assigns his claim.or interest, concern
ing any matter in respect to which he would not, if a
party, be permitted to testify.
5. A person who, if a party, would be restricted in
his evidence under ? 5242, shall, where the property or
thing is sold or transferred by an executor, administra
tor, guardian, trustee, heir, 'devisee, or lega ee, be re
stricted in the same manner in any action or proceeding concerning such property or thing. [51 v. 57, § 315; 67
v. 113, §314; S.&C. 1038.]
1. An attorney, concerning a communication made to him by his
client in that relation, etc., 11 O. S. 261; 34 O. S. 91, unless the
client consents, Id., 4 Bull 576, or testifies himself, 11 O. S. 261.
The rule does not apply where the attorney derived his knowl
edge from other sources, W. 136, and does not extend to an exjustice of the peace, 3 Bull 845. Physicians, see 43 N. Y. 125; 21
Wend. 79; 99 K. Y. 56. Attorneys, see -A t,. 679.
2. 13 Wend. 311.
3. Husband or wife, as to confidential matters, etc., 22 O. S. 527 ; 4
O. S. 513; and the removal of interest of husband or wife does
not render either competent, 10 O. S. 418, but if the communica
tion was made or act done in the known presence or hen ring of
a third person, 25 O. S. 500; 33 O. S. 441 ; 36 O. S. 595 ; 37 O. S. 402,
competent to be a witness at the time the act was done. Id.; 4
Bull 213; though such third person is not living at the time of
the trial, 39 O. S. 259, they are rendered competent. Evidence
thata third person was present and known to be present at the
time of making such communications, or doing such acts, is for
the court, and on error will be presumed to have been given to
the court, unless the contrary appears, 25 O. S. 500, ami the pres
ence of such third person is provable by husband or wife, 36
O. S. 595. Under a former amendment providing that husband
and wifeshall be incompetent to testify for or against each other,
"except in actions where the wife, were she a/cmiii^sote, would
be plaintifff or defendant, in which action the wife may testify,"
in an action against her and her husband, it was held she could
testify as to services rendered her while wife of a former de
ceased husband, 15 O. S. 172 (1804). The husband is a competent
witness to prove the wife's handwriting in letters addressed to
him, 42 O. S. 23, and is a competent witness us to slander of wife
in his presence, 32 O. S. 604. Husband and wife are held not
competent witnesses for or against each other in criminal prose
cutions, 20 O. S. 333; see § 7284 R. S.; 21 Hull 292 ; 3 C. C. R. 431.
4. A person who assigns his claim. But in an action by the in
dorsee of a promissory note against the maker, the executor of
the maker may compel the payee and assignor of the note to tes
tify to facts that occurred prior to the death of testator, 44 O. S.
5%; 17 Bull 100, reversing 1 C. C. R. 577. Under the code, as orig
inally adopted, the assignor of a chose in action was a competent
witness for the assignee in an action by him against an admin
istrator of the debtor, to prove any fact in the case, whether oc
curring before or after the death of the debtor, 9 O. S. 558, 559.
§ 5242. When party shall not testify. Exoeptions. A
party shall not testify where the adverse party is the
guardian or trustee of either a deaf and dumb or an
insane person, or of a child of a deceased person, or is
an executor or administrator, or claims or defends as
heir, grantee, assignee, devisee, or legatee, of a deceased
person, except:
1. To facts which occurred subsequent to the appoint
ment of the guardian or trustee of an insane person, and, in the other cases, subsequent to the time the de
cedent, grantor, assignor, or testator died.
2. When the action or proceeding relates to a contract
made through an agent by a person since deceased, and
the agent is competent to testify as a witness, a party
may testify on the same subject.
3. If a party, or one having a direct interest, testify
to transactions or conversations with another party, the
latter may testify as to the same transactions or conver
sations.
4. If a party offer evidence of conversations or admis
sions of the opposite party, the latter may testify con
cerning the same conversations or admissions.
5. In an action or proceeding by or against a partner
or joint contractor, the adverse party shall not testify to
transactions with, or admissions by, a partner or joint
contractor since deceased, unless the same were made in
the presence of the surviving partner or joint contractor;
and this rule shall be applied without regard to the
character in which the parties sue or are sued.
6. If the claim or defense is founded on a book account,
a party may testify that the book is his account book;
that it is a book of original entries ; that the entries
therein were made by himself, a person deceased, or a
disinterested person, non-resident of the county; where
upon the book shall be competent evidence, and such
book may be admitted in evidence in any case, without
regard to the parties, upon like proof by any competent
witness.
7. If a party, after testifying orally, die, the evidence
may be proved by either party on a further trial of the
ease ; whereupon the opposite party may testify to the
same matters.
8. If a party die, and his deposition be offered in evi
dence, the opposite party may testify as to all competent
matters therein.
Nothing in this section contained shall apply to actions
for causing death, or actions or proceedings involving
the validity of a deed, will, or codicil ; and when a case
is plainly within the reason and spirit of the last three
sections, though not within the strict letter, their princi
ples shall be applied. [82 v. 125; 74 v. 161, \ 313; 72 v. 77.]
Party incompetent when opposite party is guardian of imbe
cile, 4 C. C. R. 1.
1. Though not to farts occurring prior to the appointment of
such guardian. 29 O. S. 85, or to the death of testator or intes
tate, I3 O. S. 525; 11 O. S. 624; 22 O. S. 208 ; 2 D. 41, 46, though
the testimony is submitted by deposition, 1 D. 517; 16 O. S. 220.
But an administrator or executor mav testify in his own behalf
to conversations or transactions of deceased, 21 O. S. 658, and
he is a competent witness for eitherparty in a hearing on ex
ceptions to his account, 16 O. S. 273. When the protection of the
section was not extended to "adult heirs," it was held that a
grantor, though a party, could testify in a suit by a judgment
creditor against him and the heirs of his grantee, to prove
fraudulent collusion between himself and the deceased grantee,
13 O. S. 268. Under the amendment, 71 v. 68, the words "or
defends as heir, grantee," etc., were omitted from the section;
and it was held that in a suit for dower, the heir of a deceased
husband was a competent witness for the defense where the
title of the deceased husband was in issue, 33 O. 6. 203. In the
amendment, 68 v. 127, the word "assignee" was not included,
and the provision of the section was held not to apply to an
assignee of a chose in action, 32 O. S. 431. Under the code
as originally adopted, the assignor of a chose in action was a
competent witness for the assignee in an action by him against
an administrator of the debtor to prove any fact in the case,
whether occurring before or after the death of the debtor, 9 O. S.
659. The parties intended to be excluded from testifying by
this section are the real, and not mere formal, nominal, ana
wholly unnecessary, parties, 30 O. S. 476. The parties must be
adverse in interest, and not merely in their nominal status, 29
O. S. 663, Welch, J. 665. Both the party disqualified and the
adverse party referred to, must be parties to the record, ad
versely interested in the determination of the issues of fact,
and they must be so related to the action and the issues at the
time of trial, but it matters not whether they stand upon the
same side or opposite sides of the record, 22 O. S. 221, Mcllvaine, J. Accordingly it has been held that a grantor, not a
party to, and having no interest in, the controversy, adverse to
defendant, 18 O. S. 73 (see 41 O. S. 368; infra, subdiv. 8), or par
ties in interest, who have not been made parties to the action,
S Ree. 360; as heirs and legatees, who will derive the chief ben
efit from the result of the suit, 3 Bull 590, are not disqualified.
So a party to a suit in default for answer is not adverse in
Interest, but may be called as a witness bv his co-defendant
who has answered. 29 O. S. 663; 9 Bull 294; 17 O. S. 640; and by
analogy a party who sets up, by supplemental answer, his dis
charge in bankruptcy. which is admitted by the reply, becomes
a competent witness for his co-defendant, 9 Bull 29o. So where
ITiere are two parties, plaintifffs or defendants, claiming several
interests under the same title or state of facts, and the adverse
party is a competent witness against one, but incompetent unfier this section against the other, and the case is one in which
jjeparate judgments may be rendered, the testimony of such
party may be received as against the party as to whom the wit
ness was competent, 22 O. S. 208. And, for the same reason, m
an action against a married woman and others, where her
hushand is incompetent to testify for or against her, he is a
competent witness for a co-defendant, if the case be one in
-which separate judgments may be rendered, 24 O. S. 462. It would seem that it is the duty of an administrator or executor
to object to the testimony of the opposite party prohibited by
this section, or even of the court to interfere, 1 H. 13, 14, 18;
but where the testimony of a party is heard, subject to general
objection to his competency, because the adverse party is the
executor of a deceased person, and it does not appear whether
the event testified to occurred before or after the death of the
testator, and the executor makes no motion to strike out the
testimony, but presents counter evidence, without further insist
ing on his objection, it will be presumed that the party is
a competent witness, 8 Bull 29.
2. 2 Bull (sup.) 6. 6.
3. Where an administrator testifies, ete., the adverse party may also
to the same facts, 38 O. S. 438; 3 C. C. R. 508.
5. 28 O. S. 84. Unless the same were made in the presence of
the survivor, 41 O. S. 334.
6. Book account. But where the testimony failed to show the
account book offered in evidence to be a book of original entries,
it was held not error to exclude it, 28 O. S. 84.
8. If a party die and his deposition be offered in evidence, etc.
See 11 O. S. 624. The provisions of the section shall not apply
to proceedings involving the validity of a deed or will, 1 C. C. R.
16, 17. Under the amendments, 68 v. 127 and 72 v. 77, this clause
read, " provided that nothing herein contained .shall be so con
strued as to prevent any and all the heirs, grantees, and legatees
from testifying in cases* to contest the validity of, or to set aside,
a will or deed of any ancestor or grantor under whom they may
claim title." Under 68 v. 127, it was held that this section did
not make the husband of an heir who was joined with her as a
plaintifff in an issue of devisavit vel nan incompetent as a witness
for the contestants, 30 O. S. 472. Under 72 v. 77, it was held, the
heirs, legatees, and grantees who are declared competent wit
nesses by the proviso are such as derive title from the same per
sons, and that where a person does not claim under a will or
deed he must, to come within the proviso, claim as heir of the
testator or grantor whose will or deed is sought to be set aside,
31 O. S. 188.
"And when a case is plainly within the reason and spirit of the
last three sections, etc., their principles shall be applied." Under
this clause it has been held that a defendant is a competent wit
ness to transactions with a deceased agent of plaintifff, though
not occurring in his presence, if within the scope of suchagent's
authority, 39 O. S. 314; Okey, J., dissenting. "The omission of
agents, a class whose members equal, if they do not exceed, all
the others combined, was evidently intentional. To so construe
the last clause of paragraph 8, # 5242, us to add agents to said
enumerated classes would be judicial legislation," 41 O. S. 401,
402. Under this clause it has also been held that parties claim
ing under a conveyance from a deceased insolvent mortgagor
are competent witnesses against each other as to whose lands
shall be charged first, 42 O. S. 305 ; that a widow is a competent
witness to prove the execution and delivery bv her husband of
a deed in an action by the heirs to recover the land, 42 O. S. 211;
and where a grantee holds the legal title in trust for the grantor,
and without the knowledge of the grantor conveys the land to
another upon the same trust, in an action by the grantor
against the heirs of the second grantee to enforce the trust, the first grantee is a competent witness for the first grantor
against the heirs of the second grantee to establish the trust.
41O. S. 368. Party can testily where ad verse trustee, etc.. 1 CC.R.16
§ 5243. Opposite party may be compelled to testify.
A party may compel the adverse party to testify orally,
or by deposition, as any other witness may be thus com
pelled. [51 v. 57, I 312 ; S. & C. 1037.]
3 W. L. M. 31. In an action by nn indorsee of a promissory
note against the maker, the executor of the maker may compel
the pavee and assignor to testify to tacts that occurred prior
to the death of testator, 44 O. S. 5%; 17 Bull 100; reversing 1
C. C. R. 577.
§ 5244. How laws of other states proved. Printed
copies of written law enacted by any other state, a terri
tory, or a foreign government, purporting or proved to
have been published by the authority thereof, or proved
to be commonly admitted as evidence of the existing
law in the courts or tribunals of such state, territory, or
government, shall be admitted by the courts and officers
of this state, on all occasions, as presumptive evidence of
such law (1); the unwritten or common law of any other
state, or of a territory, or foreign government, may be
proved as facts by parol evidence (2); and the books of
reports of cases adjudicated in their courts may also be
admitted as presumptive evidence of such law. [51 v.
57, §362; S. & C. 1046.]
1. 44 N. Y. 27 ; 19 Abb. 416 ; 6 Wend. 475 ; 5 Wend. 375 ; 6 Abb.
n. s. 215. 2. 5 N. Y. 447 ; 58 N. Y. 562 ; 56 N. Y. 182 ; 1 Johns. 385.
According to our decisions, the existence, construction, and
legal effect of foreign statutes and laws are matters of fact, 15
O. S. 68; 11 O. S. 690. 691; 11 O. 255, of which judicial notice will
not be taken, 32 O. S. 163, and which must be pleaded and
proven, 40 O. S. 342, 343 ; 26 O. S. 131 ; 2 C. C. R. 3K7, 400.
§ 5245. How copies of records, etc, made competent
evidence. Copies of papers, books, and records on file
or deposited, by virtue of any law, in the office of the
governor, or secretary of state, and certified by the sec
retary of state under the great seal, or in the office of the
board of public works, certified by the president of the
board, or in the office of the auditor of state, certified by
him under his seal (1), or in the office of the surveyor
of lands lying within the Virginia military district, cer
tified and sworn to by him, and copies of copies of en
tries, surveys, and plats of lands in the Virginia military
district, procured to be made by the commissioners of
any county, and deposited with the recorder of such
county, and certified by him, and the copies of such en
tries, surveys, and plats, now in the office of the auditor
of Union county, shall be competent evidence, and have
the same force and effect as the originals would if pro
duced. [22 v. 103, § 1 ; 45 v. 54, § 1 ; 48 v. 35, § 1 ; 48 v.
69, § 6; 74 v. 217, Hi S. & C. 555, 556, 557.]
1. The statute making certified copies of the auditor of state
evidence, authorizes their admission only where the originals
would be competent, 11 O. 261, 262.
SUBDIVISION II. MEANS OF SEcuRING ATTENDANCE.
§ 5246. How attendance procured. The clerks of the
several courts, and judges of the probate courts, shall,
on application of a person having a cause or other mat
ter pending in court, issue a subpoena for witnesses,
under the seal of the court, inserting all the names re
quired by the applicant in one subpoena, which may be
served by the sheriff, coroner, or any constable of the
county, or by the party, or any other person ; and when
a subpoena is not served by the sheriff, coroner, or con
stable, proof of service shall be shown by affidavit, but
costs of such service shall not be taxed. [51 v. 57, § 316 ;
S. & C. 1038.]
§ 5247. The subpoena, The subpoena shall be directed
to a person therein named, requiring him to attend at a
particular time and place, to testify as a witness; and it
may contain a clause directing the witness to bring with
him any book, writing, or other thing under his control,
which he may be compelled to produce as evidence.
[51 v. 57, §317; S. & C. 1039.]
§ 5248. Subpoena on taking depositions. When the
attendance of a witness before an officer authorized to
take depi sitions is required, the subpoena shall be issued
by such officer. [51 v. 57, \ 318; S. & C. 1039.]
ji 6249. How subpoena served. The subpoena shall be
served either by reading, or by copy delivered to the
witness, or left at his usual place of residence; but such
copy need not contain the name of any other witness.
[51 v. 57, §31!); S. &C. 1039.]
§ 5250. Witness not compelled to attend out of county
of residence. Exception. A witness shall not be com
pelled to go out of the county whore he resides, or may
be subpoenaed, to testify on the trial of a civil action, or
to give his deposition, except where cases have been re
moved from the conntv in which such witness resides,
to another county, by change of venue, under provisions
of law; nothing herein contained shall be construed to
prevent the taking and use of depositions in such lastnamed cases; but no witness shall be compelled to go
out of his county to have his deposition taken. [82 v.
221 ; 51 v. 57, \ 320 ; S. & C. 1039.]
§ 5251. Sight of witness to demand fees in advance.
A witness may demand his traveling fees and fee for one
day's attendance when the subpoena is served upon him,
and if the same be not paid, the witness shall not be
obliged to obey the subpoena ; and, when a witness has
attended upon the court, he may in like manner demand
his fees from clay to day until discharged by the court.
The fact of such demand and payment or non-paymest
shall be stated in the return by the officer; and if the
witness be not discharged on the day he is notified to
appear, then the fact of payment or non-payment shall
be noted by the clerk in the witness book. [77 v. 216;
51 v. 57, H 321, 330; S. & C. 1039-40.]
§ 5252. Contempt of court by witness. Disobedience
of a subpoena, a refusal to be sworn, except in case of a
refusal to pay fees on demand, a refusal to answer aa a
witness or to subscribe a deposition, when lawfully or
dered, may be punished as a contempt of the court or
officer by whom the attendance or testimony of the wit
ness is required. [51 v. 57, \ 322 ; S. & C. 1039.]
Before the witness can be punished for contempt for refusal
to answer a question he must be ordered by the court or officer
to answer it, 15 Bull 197. The mere putting a question to the
witness by the attorney for the party taking a deposition, and a
failure to answer the question at the request of the attorney,
the notary making no demand, request, or order to the witness,
constitutes no contempt, and a commital theiefor is illegal, Id.
The witness must be lawfully ordered, 15 Bull 267. He is not
bound to answer any question that will directly or indirectly
criminate himself, and it would appear he has the right to de
termine whether the answer will have that effect, 10 O. 336.
But a witness is not excused from giving his deposition under
£g 5265, 5266, on the ground that he is not interested in the
action; that he is within the county in which the action is
pending, and that he does not intend to depart; that he is in
good health, and will be able to attend court as a witness when
the case is reached for trial. 17 Bull 274 ; 3 Bull 739 (see 12 Kas.
451 ; 15 Id. 366) ; contra, 15 Bull 267 ; see 3 C. C. R. 263 ; 4 Ball 487
§ 5253. Attachment against witness. When a witness fails to attend in obedience to a subpoena, the court or
officer before whom his attendance is required may
issue an attachment to the sheriff, coroner, or a consta
ble of the county, commanding him to arrest and bring
the person therein named before such court or officer, at
the time and place to be fixed in the attachment, to give
his testimony, and answer for the contempt ; if the at
tachment is not for immediately bringing the witness
before the court or officer, a sum may be fixed in which
the witness may give an undertaking, with surety, for
his appearance, which sum shall be iudorsed on the back
of the attachment, and if no sum is so fixed and indorsed,
it shall be one hundred dollars ; and if the witness was
not personally served, the court may, by a rule, order
him to show cause why an attachment should not issue
against him. [51 v. 57, § 323 ; S. & C. 1039.]
§ 5254. Proceedings for contempt of court by witness,
and punishment. The punishment for the contempt men
tioned in \ 5252 shall be as follows : When the witness
fails to attend in obedience to the subpoena, the court
or officer may fine him in a sum not exceeding fifty
dollars ; in other cases the court or officer may fine the
witness in a sum not exceeding fifty nor less than five
dollars, or may imprison him in the county jail, there
to remain until he submits to be sworn, testifies, or gives
his deposition; the fine imposed by the court shall .be
paid into the county treasury, and that imposed by the
officer shall be for the use of the party for whom the
witness was subpoenaed ; and the witness shall also be
liable to the party injured for any damages occasioned
by his failure to attend, or his refusal to be sworn, to
testify, or to give his deposition. [77 v. 45 ; 51 v. 57,
§324; S.&C. 1040.]
§ 5255. Release of witness imprisoned by an officer.
A witness so imprisoned by an officer may apply to a
judge of the supreme court, circuit court, common pleas
court, or probate court, who may discharge him, if it
appear that his imprisonment is illegal. [82 v. 33; 51 v.
57, §325; S.&C. 1040.]
§ 5256. Proceedings on arrest of witness. Every at
tachment for the arrest or order of commitment to prison
of a witness, by a court or an officer, pursuant to this
chapter, must be under the seal of the court or officer, if
the officer has an official seal, and must specify particu
larly the cause of the arrest or commitment; if the
commitment is for a refusal to answer a question, such
question must be stated in the order; and the order of
commitment may be directed to the sheriff, coroner, or
any constable of the county where the witness resides,
or is at the time, and shall be executed by committing
him to the jail of the county, and delivering a copy of
the order to the jailer. [51 v. 57, \ 326.] 3 c. C. R. 283.
§ 5257. Examination of witness in prison. A person
confined in prison in this state may, by order of a court
of record, be required to be produced for oral examina
tion in the county where he is imprisoned; but in all
other cases his examination must be bv deposition. [51
v. 57, 1 327 ; S. & C. 1040 ]
§ 5258. Custody of prisoner while deposition is being
taken. While a prisoner's deposition is being taken, he
shall remain in the custody of the officer having him in
charge, who shall afford reasonable facilities for the
taking of the deposition. [51 v. 57, § 328: S. & C. 1040.]
§ 5259. Witness not to be sued and served ont of his
county. A witness shall not be liable to be sued in a
county in which he does not reside, by being served with
a summons in such county while going, returning, or
attending in obedience to a subrxena. [51 v. 57, \ 329;
S. & C. 1040.]
§ 5260. Oath of witness. Before testifying, the wit
ness shall be sworn to testify the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth. [51 v. 57, \ 331 ; S. & C. 1040.]
SUBDIVISION III. MODES OF TAKING TESTIMONY.
§ 5261. How testimony of witness taken. The testi
mony of witnesses may be taken :
1. By affidavit.
2. By deposition.
3. By oral examination. [51 v. 57,? 332; S. & C. 1040.]
§ 5262. Kinds of testimony denned. An affidavit is a
written declaration under oath, made without notice to
the adverse party ; a deposition is a written declaration
under oath, made upon notice to the adverse party; and
oral testimony is that delivered from the lips of the wit
ness. [51 v. 57, 11 333, 334, 335; S. & C. 1040-41.]
§ 5263. Affidavit used for what purpose. An affidavit may be used to verify a pleading, to prove the service of
a summons, notice, or other process in an action, te ob
tain a provisional remedy, an examination of a witness,
a stay of proceedings, or upon a motion, and in any
other case permitted bylaw. [51 v. 57, §336; S.&C. 1041.]
§ 5264. Before whom affidavit may be made. An affi
davit may be made in or out of this state, before any
person authorized to take depositions, and must be au
thenticated in the same way as depositions, except as
provided in \ 5107. [51 v. 57, I 337 ; S. & C. 1041.]
§ 526!), 5270.
§ 5265. When deposition may be used. The deposition
of a witness may be used only in the following cases:
1. When the witness does not reside in, or is absent
from, the county where the action or proceeding is pend
ing, or by change of venue, is sent for trial.
2. When the witness is dead, or, from age, infirmity, or
imprisonment, is unable to attend court.
3. When the testimony is required upon a motion, or
where the oral examination of the witness is not required.
[51 v. 57, I 338; 52 v. 27; S. & C. 1041, 1170.]
The opposite party may use a deposition when filed, T. 127,
651 ; 2 W. L. M. 388, though it is not used by the party taking it,
W. 651. It is sufficient if the witness was competent when the
deposition was taken, 2 W. I.. J. 426; contra, 17 O. 44. A waiver
of objection to the competency of a witness so as to allow his
deposition to be taken in the case is a waiver during the whole
progress of the case, and the objection can not be insisted on
when the witness is called to give a second deposition in the
same case, 8 O S. 424.
1. But if the opposite party die after the deposition of a non
resident is taken, it can not be admitted under the rule in % 5242,
1 D. 517; 16 O. S. 220; 12 Bull 286
2. See 5 O. 279.
3. Wee I 5252m, referring to 17 Bull 274 ; 3 Bull 739; 12 Kas.451;
contra, 15 Bull 267.
§ 5266. Time when deposition may be taken. Either
party may commence taking testimony by deposition at
any time after service upon the defendant. [51 v. 57,
§339; S.&C. 1041.]
§ 5267. Testimony taken by referee, etc., may be used
as a deposition. Testimony taken in an action or pro
ceeding, on the order of a court, by a referee, master
commissioner, or special master commissioner, subscribed
by the witness, and reported to the court by the officer, may be used aa a deposition taken in the case. [64 v. 144.]
8 Rec. 364 ; 40 O. S. 845.
And is, after the decease of such witness, admissible in any
subsequent trial ot the case in court, 14 O. S. 434 (1863).
§ 5268. Deposition in foreign suit. Depositions may
also be taken when the testimony is required in an ac
tion, cause, or matter pending before any court or au
thority without this state. [52 v. 27 ; S. & C. 1170.]
§ 5269. Who may take depositions in the state. Depo
sitions may be taken in this state before a judge or the
clerk of the supreme court, a judge or clerk of the circuit
court, a judge or clerk of the common pleas court, a
probate judge, justice of the peace, notary public, mayor,
master commissioner, official stenographer of any court
in this state, or any person empowered by a special
commission ; but depositions taken in this state, to be
used therein, must be taken by an officer or person whose
authority is derived within ihe state, and, if to be used
out of the state, they may be taken before a commis
sioner or officer who derives his authority from the
state, district, or territory in which they are to be used.
[86 v. 78.]
Stenographers, 7 Bull 270; § 481 R. S.
§ 5270. Who may take depositions out of the state.
Depositions may be taken out of this state before a judge,
justice, or chancellor of any court of record, a justice of
the peace, notary public, mayor, or chief magistrate of
any municipal corporation, a commissioner appointed
by the governor of this state to take depositions, or any
person authorized by a special commission from this
state. [51 v. 57, \ 341 ; S. & C. 1041.]
Clerk of court out of the state can not take depositions unless
authorized by special commission, 4 Neb. 368. Under stat. 1824
the mayor of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, could not
take depositions, 5 O. 330.
§ 5271. Who can not take depositions. The officer be
fore whom depositions are taken must not be a relative
or attorney of either party, or otherwise interested in the
event of the action or proceeding. [51 v. 57, § 342;
S. & C. 1042.]
§ 5272. Commission to take depositions. Any court
of record of this state, or a judge thereof, may grant a commission to take depositions within or without the
state, which commission must be issued by the clerk,
and under the seal of the court granting the same ; and
the person or persons to whom it is issued must be named
therein, and depositions under it must be taken upon
written interrogatories unless the parties otherwise agree.
[51 v. 57, § 343 ; S. & C. 1042.]
§ 5273. Notice to take depositions. Service. Written
notice of the intention to take a deposition shall be
given to the adverse party (1), except in cases in which
it is to be taken under a special commission, and shall
specify the action or proceeding, the name of the court
or tribunal in which the deposition is to be used, and
the time when and place (2) where it will be taken,
and, in case the deposition of a party to the suit be
taken, it shall not be used in his own behalf, unless the
notice specified that his deposition would be taken (3);
the notice_ shall be served upon the adverse party, his
agent or attorney of record, or left at the usual place of
abode of such party or his agent (4), and the deposition
shall only be used against such parties as are served
with notice in one of the modes prescribed ; the notice
shall be served so as to allow the adverse party suffi
cient time, exclusive of Sundays, the day of service, and
one day for preparation, to travel by the usual routes
and modes of conveyance to the place named in the
notice (5); and the examination may, if so stated in the
notice, be adjourned from day to day. [58 v. 58, \ 344 ;
S. & 8. 560.]
1. A deposition taken without notice can not be read, though
service is impossible, W. lo6, but where there is an appearance
by the party or his attorney at the time and place of taking the
deposition and a cross examination without objection, it is a
waiver of any irregularity in giving notice, and indeed dispenses
with the necessity of notice, 1 H. 15. And where, after a depo
sition w as taken, new parties were made, and they filed no excep
tions to the deposition at any time, and on the trial objected to it
only on the ground of incompetency, it was held that they waived
the objection that they had no notice of the taking of the deposi
tion, 41 O. S. 3fi8. 2. " The city of Cleveland " is definite enough,
withoutgivingthecountyand state, 2 W. L. M. 388, and if the time
and place are given, the name of the officer need not be given,
T. 137. Misnomer of the officer will not vitiate the notice, W.
636. It has been held that notice may be served to take deposi
tions at the same time and place in different cases, 20 O. 119; 128
(1851). 3. But the objection is waived by an appearance and
cross-examination, 1 H. 13, 15, or by going to trial without filing exceptions as required by U 52S4, 5285. 9 Bull 156 ; 39 O. S. 100, 105.
4. Service by leaving a copy at attorney's office, or service on assistantattorney, is insufficient, 2 O. S. 593 ; 2 C. S. C. R. 68. Rem
edy, motion to strike deposition from files, though there has
been delay unaccounted for in making it, 2 O. S. C. R. 63.
5. Notice on 21st November at Cincinnati to take at Little Rock,
Ark., on 12th December, reasonable, 1 H. 400. Service at 5 P. M.
to take at 2 to 5 p. M. next day, was held sufficient, when the dis
tance was under twenty miles, 1 W. L. J. 894. It has been held
that service may be proven in the deposition. 1 W. L. J. 894, or
by one of the attorneys, though the notice was not attached to
the deposition, 20 O. 119, but could not be proved bv the party,
10 O. 397.
ii 5274. Notice by publication. When the party against
whom a deposition is to be read is absent from or a non
resident ot the state, and has no agent or attorney of
record therein, he may be notified of the taking of the
deposition by publication ; the publication must be made
for three consecutive weeks, in a newspaper printed in
the county where the action or proceeding is pending, if
one is printed therein, and if no newspaper is printed
therein, then in a newspaper printed in the state, and of
general circulation in that county; and the publication
must contain all that is required in a written notice, and
may be proved in the manner prescribed in jj 5051.
[51 v. 57, ji 345 ; S. & C. 1042.]
§ 5275. By whom deposition to be written. The depo
sition shall be written in the presence of the officer before
whom it is taken, either by the officer, the witness, or
some disinterested person, and subscribed by the witness.
[51 v. 57, §346; S. & C. 1042.]
§ 5276. Depositions to be sealed, indorsed, and forwarded
to olerk. The deposition so taken shall be sealed in an en
velope, indorsed with the title of the cause, and the name
of the officer before whom it was taken, and such officer
shall address and transmit the same to the clerk of the
court where the action or proceeding is pending; and it
shall remain under seal until opened by the clerk, by
order of the court, or at the request of a party to the
action or proceeding, or his attornev. [51 v. 57, \ 347 ;
S. & C. 1042.]
And where they were properly scaled up and indorsed, the
fact that they were inclosed in another envelope addressed to
the clerk, but without other indorsement, is not objectionable,
32 O. S. 163.
§ 5277. Before what oourts depositions may be used.
Depositions taken pursuant to this chapter shall be ad
mitted in evidence on the trial of any civil action or
proceeding pending before a justice of the peace, or
mayor or other judicial officer of a municipal coporation, or before arbitrators, a referee, or a master ; and
such depositions shall be sealed up, indorsed with the
title of the action or proceeding, the name of the officer
before whom taken, and addressed and transmitted by
such officer to such justice, mayor, or other judicial
officer, arbitrators, referee, or master. [51 v. 57, § 348 ;
S. & C. 1043.]
Justices of the peace, § 6544.
§ 5278. When deposition may be used in other oases.
A deposition may be read in any stage of the action or
proceeding, or in any other action or proceeding upon the
same.matter between the same parties, subject, however,
to such exceptions as may be taken thereto under the
provisions of this chapter. [51 v. 57, \ 349 ; S. & C. 1043.]
Formerly it could not, 19 O. 142, 460. As a general rule, depo
sitions read in evidence should be sent to the jury on their re
tirement, 1 C. S. C. R. 105 ; 2 O. S. 58S. But where part of a
deposition which could not be separated from the balance, con
tained incompetent evidence which was ruled out, it was held
that the court might, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to
send it to the jury, 2 O. S. 588; see 8 Rec. 364 ; 40 O. S. 845;
3 C. C. R. 500.
f> 5279. Certificate of authentication. Depositions
taken pursuant to this chapter, by a judicial or other
officer herein authorized to take depositions, having a
seal of office, whether resident in this state or elsewhere,
shall be admitted in evidence upon the certificate and
signature of such officer, under the seal of the court of
which he is an officer, or his official seal, and no other
or further act of authentication shall be required ; if the
officer before whom the same is taken has no official
seal, the depositions, if not taken in this state, shall be
certified and signed by such officer, and shall be further
authenticated, either by parol proof adduced in court,
or by the certificate and seal of the secretary or other
officer of state who is the custodian of the great seal of
the state, or the certificate and official seal of the clerk
or prothonotary of any court of the state where taken,
attesting that such officer was, at the time of taking the
same, authorized, within the meaning of this chapter, to take thesame ; but if the deposition is taken within this
state by an officer not having a seal, or within or with
out this state under a fpecial commission, it shall be
sufficiently authenticated by the official signature of the
officer or commission before whom it is taken ; and when
a deposition is not certified according to law, the fact
neglected to be certified may be shown by parol proof.
[51 v. 57, ? 350 ; 57 v. 41, ? 1; S. iSc C. 1043, 1171.]
§ 5280. Certificate of officer. The officer before whom
the deposition is taken shall annex thereto a certificate
showing the following facts :
1. That the witness was first sworn to testify the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
2. That the deposition was reduced to writing by some
proper person, naming him.
3. That the deposition was written and subscribed in
the presence of the officer certifying thereto.
4. That the deposition was taken at the time and place
specified in the notice.
But if the deposition be taken out of the state, by an
officer authorized to take the same, the certificate may
be in the foregoing form, or in the form authorized by
the laws of the place where taken ; and in the latter case
the certificate shall be deemed, prima facie, as made in
accordance with the laws of the place where made.
[51 v. 57, 1 351 ; S. & C. 1043.]
The certificate must show affirmatively that the requisitions
of the section have been complied with; and a presumption that
the officer did what the law prescribes is insufficient, 1 H. 95.
1. The certificate must state that the witness was "first'' duly
sworn, 6 O. S. 497. to testify the truth, etc., 1 H. 42. the "whote
truth," W. 380; but the omission of the word " first" in the cer
tificate is not objectionable if it appears in the commencement
of the deposition, 1 H. 400.
2. W. 746.
3. See 1 H. 42.
§ 5281. When depositions may be read. When a depo
sition is offered to be read in evidence, it must appear, to
the satisfaction of the court, that for a cause specified in
§ 5265, the attendance of the witness can not be procured.
[51 v. 57, 1 352; S. & C. 1044]
§ 5282. When depositions to be filed. Every depo
sition intended to be read in evidence on the trial must
be filed at least one day before the day of trial. [51 v.
57J353; S.&C. 1044.]
But the objection may be waived by proceeding to trial with
out filing exceptions, 2 W. L. M. 388.
§ 5283. Fees for taking depositions. The following
fees shall be allowed for taking depositions in this state,
viz. : Swearing each witness, four cents ; for each sub
poena, attachment, or order of commitment, fifty cents;
for each hundred words contained in the deposition and
certificate, ten cents ; and the officer may retain the depo
sition until such fees are paid; the officer shall also tax
the costs of the sheriff or other officer who serves the
process aforesaid, and fees of the witnesses; and he may,
if directed by a person entitled thereto, retain such depo
sitions until his fees are paid. [51 v. 57, \ 354; S. & C.
1044.]
See 9 Bull 103.
§ 5384. Exceptions to depositions. Exceptions to
depositions shall be in writing, shall specify the grounds
of objection, and shall be filed with the papers in the
cause. [51 v. 57, § 355 ; S. & C. 1044.]
20 O. 127 ; 2 O. S. 322.
§ 5285. Must be filed before trial. No exception other
than for incompetency or irrelevancy shall be regarded,
unless made and filed before the commencement of the
trial. [51 v. 57, § 356 ; S. & C. 1044.]
See I 5273n. Exception that the party's name was omitted in
the notice. 9 Bull 156 ; 39 O. S. 100, 105 ; that the word " sworn "
was omitted in the certificate of the notary, 2 O. S. 322; that
new parties made after the taking of a deposition had no notice
under § 5273. must be made before trial, 41 O. S. 368. And an
objection that a question is a leading one should be made at the
time it is propounded or before trial, 3 O. S. 406. The rule of
practice of the supreme court required that " no exceptions to
depositions for other causes than the competency of the witness,
or relevancy of the testimony, shall be heard unless the same be
made in writing and notice thereof given to the opposite coun
sel before the cause is called for trial," 2 O. S. 322; see 1 H. 13.
§ 5286. Court to decide exceptions before trial. The
court shall, on motion of either party, hear and decide
questions arising on exceptions to depositions before the
commencement of the trial. [51 v. 57, \ 357 ; S. & C.
1045.1
§ 5287. When objections waived. Errors of the court
in its decisions upon exceptions to depositions are waived
unless excepted to. [51 v. 57, § 358 ; S. & C. 1045.]
§ 5288. Party may be required to admit a paper to be
genuine or pay expenses of proof. Either party may ex
hibit to the other, or to his attorney, at any time before
the trial, any paper or document material to the action,
and request an admission in writing of its genuineness;
and if the adverse party, or his attorney, fail to give the
admission in writing within four days after the request,
and if the party exhibiting the paper or document be
afterward put to any cost or expense to prove its genu
ineness, and the same be finally proved or admitted on
the trial, such cost and expense, to be ascertained at the
trial, shall be paid by the party refusing to make the ad
mission, unless it appear, to the satisfaction of the court,
that there were good reasons for the refusal. [51 v. 57,
§ 359 ; S. & C. 1045.]
§ 5289. Party may be compelled to produoe books and
writings. The court in which an action is pending may,
on motion, and on reasonable notice thereof, require the
parties to produce books and writings in their possession
or power which contain evidence pertinent to the issue,
in cases and under circumstances where they might
heretofore have been compelled to produce the same by
the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery ; if the
plaintifff fail to comply with such order to produce
books or writings, the court may, on motion, give judg
ment for the defendant as in case of non-suit; and
if a defendant fail to comply with such order to produce
books or writings, the court, on motion, may give judg
ment against him by default. [54 v. 23, § 3btj.]
The section does not authorize compulsory production be
fore notary, 3 Bull 673.
Notice must, as a general rule, be given before trial. 20 O. 132 ;
but when, from the nature of the action, defendant has notice,
formal notice is not essential as a foundation for the introduc
tion of parol testimony as to the contents of the instrument, 38
O. S. 122. Where defendant denies possession of a paper by affi
davit, the court can not decide on affidavits the question of fact
thus presented and render judgment as l,y default, 17 O. S. 76.
Sufficiency of evidence to sustain motion for inspection of books,
see 2 C. S. C. R. 76. See generally as to the introduction of parol
evidence, when the instrument is in the possession of defendant,
T. 48 ; 1 C. S. C. R. 292, and not produced after notice, 5 W. L. J. 8.
§ 5290. Party entitled to inspection and copy of books
and documents. Either party, or his attorney, may also
lfidemand of the adverse party an inspection and copy, or
permission to take a copy, of a book, paper, or docu
ment in his possession, or under his control, containing
evidence relating to the merits of the action or defense,
which demand shall he in writing, and shall specify the
book, paper, or document with sufficient particularity to
enable the other party to distinguish it ; if compliance
with the demand within four days be refused, the court
or judge may, on motion, and notice to the adverse party,
order the adverse party to give the other, within the
time specified, an inspection and copy, or permission to
take a copy of such book, paper, or document; and on
failure to comply with such order, the court may exclude
the paper or document from being given in evidence, or,
if wanted as evidence by the party applying, may direct
the jury to presume it to be such as the party, by affida
vit, alleges it to be; but this section shall not be con
strued to prevent a party from compelling another to
produce anv book, paper, or document when he is ex
amined as a, witness. [54 v. 23, \ 360 ; S. & C. 1045.]
§ 5291. When court may appoint master to inspect
books, papers, etc. If the party in possession of any
such book, paper, writing, or document, allege that the
same, or any part thereof, is of mere private interest, or
of such character that it ought not to be produced, or an
inspection or copy thereof allowed or taken, the court
may, on motion of either party, direct a private exam
ination thereof by a master; if the master find that such
book, paper, writing, or document contains matter perti
nent to the case, and proper to be produced, inspected,
or copied, he shall report the same to the court, or a
copy of such part as he finds pertinent to the case, and
proper to be produced, inspected, or copied ; and the
book, paper, writing, or document, or part thereof, so
reported, shall be admitted in evidence on the trial, un
less excluded by the court for proper cause. [54 v. 23,
?360; S. &C. 1045.]
§ 5292. How copies of written instrument obtained.
Either party, or his attorney, shall, if required, deliver
to the other party, or his attorney, a copy of any instru
ment of writing whereon the action or defense is founded,
or which he intends to offer in evidence at the trial ; and
if the plaintifff or defendant refuse to furnish the copy
ft? 5203-5294
required, the party so refusing shall not be permitted to
give in evidence at the trial the original, of which a copy
has been refused ; but this section shall not apply to a
paper, a copy of which is filed with a pleading, an pro
vided in I 5085. [§1 y. 57, I 361 ; & & C. 1046.] '
When the suit is on an account which is attached as an ex
hibit to the petition, and the exhibit is perhaps imperfect lh the
description of the goods or merchandise, the monies paid or the
duty performed, the remedy is to demand a bill of particulars
under this section, 2 D. 499.
§ 5293. Action for discovery. When a person claim
ing to have a cause of action, or a defense to an action
commenced against him, is unable, without a discovery
of the fact from the adverse party, Iq file his petition or
answer, such person may bring his action for discovery,
setting forth in his petition the necessity of such dis
covery, and the grounds thereof, and such interroga
tories relating to the subject matter of the discovery as
may be necessary to procure the discovery sought,
which, if not demurred to, shall be fully and directly
answered, under oath, by the defendant; and, upon the
final disposition of the action, the costs thereof shall be
taxed in such manner as the court deems equitable. [54
v. 23, § 3; S.& C. 1151.]
Under the code a discovery can not be asked for in the peti
tion. To enable the plaintifff to find out the character and
extent of his actual cause of action, he must state facts in his
petition to show a cause of action against the defendants, 1 Ii.
156. Suits for discovery before code obsolete, 45 O. S. 356; scl>
44 O. S. 596, 603.
SUBDIVISION V. VARIANCE.
§ 5294. When variance deemed material. Amendment.
No variance between the allegation in a pleading, and
the proof, shall be deemed material, unless it has actu
ally misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in main
taining his action or defense upon the merits (1), and
when it is alleged that a party has been so misled, that
fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court, and
it must also be shown in what respect he has been mis
led (2); and thereupon the court may order the plead
ing to be amended, upon such terms as are just (3). [51
y. 57, 1 131 ; S. & C. 987.]
1. 30 O. S. 92. To constitute a variance between the allegations and the proofs, the difference must be as to the substan
tial elements of the case, and not as to the legal conclusions
from the facts drawn by the pleader, 27 O. S. 159. 2. 41 O. S.
69 ; 11 N. Y. 368 ; 6 Oreg. 156 ; 68 Mo. 626 ; 79 Mo. 275. 3. 34 How.
Pr. 467 ; 35 Barb. 298 ; 50 Barb. 95; and, when not objected to,
disregarded after judgment, 15 O. S. 211 ; 35 O. S. 367. It is too
late on error to make the objection, 24 O. S. 598 ; see 34 O. S. 399.
§ 5295. Variance not material. Amendment without
costs. When the variance is not material, the court may
direct the fact to be found according to the evidence,
and may order an immediate amendment without costs.
[51 v. 57, 1 132 ; S. & C. 989.]
Immaterial variances. Where an item of an account on which,
suit is brought is not proved on the trial to the full extent
claimed in the petition, but the variance between the allega
tions and the proof is not such as to mislead the defendant in
regard to the nature and character of the claim, such variance
will not prevent a recovery, if the facts proved show a good
cause of action, 30 O. S. 92. An averment of a cash considera
tion, in hand paid, and proof that the consideration was a sight
draft, which was paid, amendable variance, 5 Wall. 689. A va
riance between the allegations and proof as to such provisions
of a contract as are not essential to a recovery is not such a vari
ance as to defeat the plaintifff's action, 28 O. S. 418; an allega
tion that plaintifff refused to enter into a contract unless one of
the defendants should indorse such contract and become respon
sible for its performance, and proof that said defendant should
join in and sign the same, 4 Hun 561 ; petition on a quantum
meruit and proof showing special contract and fixing price, 1
Hun 75. Where a verbal contract, as proved, was made at a dif
ferent date from that alleged in the petition, amendment, before
judgment, to conform to the proof is proper, 6 Bull 338. If the
plaintifff had a cause of action for the breach of the contract
proved, it would be no objection to his right to recover that all
the terms of the contract, as alleged in the petition, were not
sustained by the testimony. This is a mere question of vari
ance, 30 O. S. 180; averment of au express agreement, evidence
of an implied one, 49 Barb. 39S. A variance as to dates will not,
in general, be regarded as material, unless they are of the gist of
the action, 4 Wall. 642 ; 10 How. Pr. 297, and a variance in mat
ters of description must be such as to mislead the adverse party
to be material, 28 N. Y. 515. Where the petition describes a bill
of exchange as payable to the order of A, and the bill offered in
evidence is payable to B, an amendment was allowed, 7 Cal. 135.
Where an instrument in writing was described in the petition as
a contract to pay one hundred dollars, and the contract given in
evidence was an agreement to pay one dollar, the petition was
considered as amended in the higher court, 42 Ind. 103. Where
the petition alleged that a draft was signed John Q. Jackson,
and the proof showed that it was signed John Q. Jackson, agent,
the variance was held to be immaterial, 28 Cal. 263. Where let
ters were declared on, in substance, as showing a contract, a lit
eral variance between one of them as presented in evidence and
as set forth in the pleading, is not sufficient to exclude it, 55 Ga.
164. Where the petition described a promissory note, upon .which the action was founded, as payable " three months after
date," and that produced on the trial was payable four months
after date, the variance was held to be immaterial, 4 Duer. 448;
but where a note declared on did not mention any place of pay
ment, and that offered in evidence was made payable at a cer
tain bank, the variance was held to be fatal, 73 Mo. 327. Where
time is not descriptive of the date of an instrument, proof that
it was made at a different time is not a fatal variance, 12 O. 300;
and under the code, where the petition showed an agreement
for extension of time from April 7th until next spring, and the
proof that the agreement was for an extension of time for one
year, it was held that this was not such a variance as would de
feat the action, .18 O. S. 634, 537. An esfopjtel must be socially
pleaded to authorize evidence to establish "it, 6 Oreg. 231, and in
an action declaring on a written contract, it was held that evi
dence of facts showing an estoppel to deny such contract
amounted to a failure of proof, 37 la. 229; an allegation of false
and fraudulent assertions and proof of an implied warranty,
though nofraud is shown, not fatally variant. 56 li:irb. 59. Alle
gations of a joint contract made by several defendants, and proof
that only part of them contracted, will not, under § 5311, be re
garded as a material' variance, 10 O. S. 451 ; 33 O. S. 395; but if
the plaintifff alleges a joint undertaking of the plaintifff and an
other, and proves only a separate undertaking bv the plaintifff
alone, this is a failure of proof, 13 O. S. 72; 17 O. S. 183, 323.1 A
mere misnomer will be regarded as immaterial, 7 Abb. l'r. 134.
Where the petition averred neglu(cnce in moving a car under
which plaintifff was working, without notice or warning, and
the proof showed that the negligence in not giving notice or
warning was attributable to the foreman under whose control
plaintifff w as working, this was held a case of variance, and not
one of failure of proof, 36 O. S. 221. An allegation of neglect
ing to forward goods, and proof of a refusal to deliver at their
destination, not fatal ,36 How. Pr. 138 ; and an averment of wrong
fully setting fire to a building, and proof of negligent 6re, 25
N. Y. 252, 259. Nuisance, see 15 O. S. 211. Averment in an action
against one as ^physician, proof that heheld himself out asa "can
cer doctor," a mere variance, 29 O. S. 577; but an averment of an
agreement to attend a patient and of an agreement to effect a cure
were held fatal, W. 351 ; a declaration alleging a promise to effecta
cure can only be sustained by an express promise, 7 O. (Pt.2) 123.
Allegation that a boat was wrecked at a certain place on a dam,
and proof that it was wrecked in crossing over the dam, not fatal,
5O.410. Allegation of a sale in writing, and proof of an oral
sale. 30 Cal. 360; cf. 2 O. S. 131 ; an allegation that defendant had
purchased certain goods, and proof that the purchase had been
made for the defendant by another, as his agent, 6O la. 180;
allegation of an agreed compensation for services, and proof of
the value of the services, 65 N. Y. 319; allegation of services in
making a sale, and proof of services in trying to make a sale, 30
O. S. 96; allegation that defendant owes the plaintifff for labor
and services " in procuring a loan," and proof that the money
was obtained ready to be loaned, but that defendant, by his
negligence, prevented the completion of the loan, 56 Wis. 456;
charging plaintifff, in an action of slander, with sleeping with
a man not her husband, and proving that such person was in
bed with her, not a failure of proof, 36 (). S. 107 ; see 45 O. S. 470.
1 See 21 Bull 295.
§ 5296. Failure of proof not a variance. When the
allegation of the claim or defense, to which the proof is
directed, is unproved, not in some particular or particu
lars only, but in its general scope and meaning, it shall
not be deemed a case of variance within the last two sec
tions, but a failure of proof. [51 v. 57, \ 133 ; S. & C. 989.]
A failure of proof is where no cause of action or defense what
ever has been proved, 9 Daly 391. In case of failure of proof if
the testimony is objected to by the adverse party, it must be
excluded, whether he would be misled or not, 10 O. S. 6"21; 21
O. S. 668; but it has been held that the objection must be dis
tinctly taken at the trial or it is not available, 7 Abb. n. s. 258;
263 cf. 22 O. S. 388. In an action on an account for work and labor,
the plaintifff can not recover on proof of facts show.ng a guar
anty by the defendant that other parties would pay fur the work,
85 la. 80. If the action is brought on an account stated, and the
proof fails to show .such an account, though it may indicate a
liability on a special contract, or for fraud, it is a ca-e of failure
of proof, 12 Jones & S. 424; 81 N. Y. 268. Declaration averring
existence of bond, and making profcrt, not sustained by proof
of lost bond, 19 O. 360 (before code); allegation of an ordinary
contract is not supported by proof of a special contract, 2 O. S.
131 (before code); an averment of work and laboron defendant's
mill-dam. and proof that the work and labor were performed
in the defendant's harvest field, a fatal variance, 21 O. S. 668. In
an action on a contract there can not be a recovery for a tort, 2
Hun 466, and rice cersa 50 N. Y. 1 ; estoppel, $ 5295n. Where the
petition charges the defendant withfraud in obtaining goods and
converting them to his own use, and the proof shows the defend
ant to be a blma fide purchaser from one in possession without
title, the case is one of failure of pr ,of, 22 O. S. 388. Where fraud
is alleged, a recovery can not be had for breach of contract, 50
N.Y.I; but it has been held that if, by striking out the words
sounding in tort, a complete statement of a cause of action on
contract is made, and the defendant is not misled, an amendment
may be allowed, 12 N. Y. Week. Dig. 528. Joint andseceral liability,
§ 5295n. Where the petition alleges negtect ot a railroad to con
struct cattle-guards, a recovery can not be had for neglect to
build fences, 16 Barb. 315, Where the action is for damages for
an alleged defect in the construction of an engine, plaintifff can
not recover for an injury resulting from a defect in the track, 64
Mo. 249; 71 Id. 514. In a petition stating facts constituting a nui
sance of one k ind, it is not permissible to prove a nuisance of a
character essentially different, 18 Minn. 176; and an averment
of a fence across the road is not supported by evidence of a fence
near the road, 10 O. S. 611; averment in a declaration that
plaintifff was entitled to the use of a " public alley," is not sup
ported by a proof of a right to use a private alley, 4 O. 543. Un
der a plea of performance, a waicer can not be proved, 37 O. S. 49;
if the waiver is relied on, it must be specially pleaded. 5 Neb. 50.
In an action for the recovery of real estate, of which the legal
title is in plaintifff, a defense grounded on an equitable title must
be pleaded. The case is one of failure of proof, 36 O. S. 358, 361.
§ 5297. What is an exception. An exception is an
objection taken to a decision of the court upon a matter
of law. [51 v. 57, I 290; S. & C. 1028.]
See notes. \\ 5190, 6707.
§ 5298. When exception must be made. The party
objecting to the decision must except at the time the
decision is made (1); and time may be given to reduce
the exception to writing, but not more than thirtv days
beyond the term at which the verdict of the jury is ren
dered, or the cause is decided when tried, to the court (2).
[84 v. 69; 51 v. 57, § 291 ; S. & C. 1028.]
1. 12 O. S. 1 ; 10 O. S. 223 ; 22 O. S. 324 ; 21 O. S. 054, 564 ; 19 O.
300; IV,. C. R. S3. And the hill must show that the exception
was taken, same cases. Error ol law must be excepted to at the
trial term, as the law stood in 1874, 32 O. S. 258 ; but exceptions to
overruling a motion for a new trial can be taken when the order
is made, 5 O. S. Bl, though the ground of the motion was error of
the court on the trial not excepted to at the time. Id. 2. Previ
ous to the amendment of 1887 (84 v. 69), this part of the section
read, "and time may be given to reduce the exception to writing,
but not beyond the term." Generally, 3 ('. C. R. 3:)3, 398.
§ 5299. Form of stating exception. No particular
form of exception is required; and the exception must
be stated, with the facts, or so much of the evidence as
is necessary to explain it, and no more, and the whole
as briefly as possible. [51 v. 57, 1 292 ; S. & C. 1028.]
Want of formality will not vitiate, 28 O. S. 561. No particular
form of exception is required, 28 O. S. 561. Affidavits form no
part of the record unless made so by bill of exceptions, 23 O. S.
192, and when copied in the record without a bill of exceptions
can not be considered, 23 O. S. 192; 21 O. S. 82; 82 O. S. 276. An
agreed statement of facts forms no part of the record unless made
so by bill of exceptions, 16 O. 170; see 18 O. 122 ; and can not be
made to supply the bill. 23 O. S. 577; nor can the certificate of
the clerk. 6 0. 15 ; 23 O. S. 577 ; but where there was a motion for
a new trial, made on the ground that the finding and judgment
of the court was not supported by the law and the evidence,
which was overruled, and all the testimony offered before the
trial court was in an agreed statement of facts In writing car
ried into the record and found by the court to be all the testi
mony offered by the parties on the trial, it was held unneces
sary, on overruling the motion, to re-embody the same in a bill
of exceptions. 27 O. S. 252. Charge of court as well as evidence
considered when contained in tlie bill, 32 O. S. 328, 494. When
entered on the journal it is not a substitute for the bill, 31 O. S.
431, 536; 33 O. S. 444. The bill must set forth the charge of the
court excepted to, 16 O. S. 344; and when the exception is to
only part of the charge, the entire charge need not be set out, 38
O. S. 534. Exceptions taken to a general charge are not regarded
on error unless the part objected to or the ground of objection
is pointed out at the time, 25 O. S. 584; 33 O. S. 429. Special
exceptions to charge not in all cases necessary, 40 O. S. 52. Giv
ing the substance, of a deposition is insufficient, 30 O. S. 104.
Where the ground of reversal is that the verdict is not sustained
by the evidence, it must affirmatively appear from the record
that the bill of exceptions contains all the evidence, 4 O. S156; contra, non-suit, 3C C. K. 36; and though the bill alleges
that it contains all the evidence, if it appears from it that mate
rial evidence referred to therein was omitted, judgment will
not be reversed on the ground that the verdict is against the
evidence, 33 O. S. 77. The bill must set out all the evidence re
lating to a motion for non-suit, 17 O. 439, and all the evidence
relating to an alleged erroneous finding, 16 O. S. 328, and the
evidence on exception to ruling on motion for a new trial, 22
O. S. 516; 17 O. 498. Evidence constituting part of the legal
record need not be set out (written examination in probate
court in proceeding by administrator against one suspected of
having embezzled the effects of the estate), 19 O. S. 556; but the
evidence rejected must be set out, 33 O. S. 444; 1 O. S. 253; its
materiality must be shown, 5 O. S. 325. and it must be shown
whatit was proposed to prove by the question rejected, 33 O. S.
429, 444; 19 O. S. 573; but it is sufficient to state the facts which
such testimony tended to prove, 22 O. S. 451 ; and " where a wit
ness is rejected for incompetency to testify in a case, the court
not having required the party producing the witness to state
what he expected to prove by him, the bill of exceptions need
not set forth what the witness would prove or was expected to
prove in order to show that the party producing thewitness had
been prejudiced," 9 O..S. 1, 9; see 30 O. S. 472; but it is best to
state the substance, of what the party offered to prove, and
claimed he could prove, by such witness, Yaple's Pr., etc. 533;
17 O. 495; and necessary to do so when the ruling relates to the
competency of the evidence and not of the witness. 9 O. S. 1; 11
O. S. 114, 2 O. S. 569. 574. Where evidence excepted to is im
properly admitted, and all the evidence is not set forth in the
bill of exceptions, nor all the facts which the evidence tended
to prove, judgment should be reversed, 20 O. 8. 517; 1 O. S. 141.
Where a bill of exceptions merely states that there was evidence
"tending to prove certain facts," the court can not infer that
the evidence tended to prove any other fact, 2 C. S. C. R. 251 ;
and when the statement in the bill of exceptions was that testi
mony was introduced tending to show, etc., this was held insuf
ficient to advise the court whether the verdict was manifestly
against the evidence so as to entitle the aggrieved party to a
new trial, 2 O. S. 593. When the question was whether the court
erred in finding that plaintifff had no authority to make the
contract sued on, and the bill only set forth the evidence tend
ing to prove the authority, and did not show whether there was
or was.not evidence tending to disprove it, it was held no ground
of reversal was shown, 18 O. S. 419. Exhibits sufficiently identi
fied if referred to aud marked, though not actually attached to
bill, 2 C. S. C. R. 37. An exhibit referred to as containing the
evidence is not available to show rulings of the court, 23 O. S.
167, 168. The bill must set out all the facts proven, 16 O. S. 60.
The court can only look at the facts stated in the bill, 20 O. 34 ;
7 O. (Pt. 1) 212. Allegations of fact made in a motion for a new
trial not supported by the record, nor made part thereof by the
bill of exceptions, can not be considered upon proceedings in
error, 30 O. S. 575. Judgment will not be reversed because
erroneous instructions were given to the jury unless the record
discloses some evidence tending to show the instructions were
material, 4 O. S. 251. Objection that the jury was not properly
sworn is of no avail where neither the bill uor the record shows
the form of oath, 28 O. S. 669. An objection that counsel was
not permitted to read to the jury from a scientific work will not
be regarded unless it appears from the bill of exceptions that
the passage was relevant or came within the legitimate scope of
argument, 1 O. S. 286. Papers must be set out or attached to the
bill of exceptions, or in some way connected therewith, so us to
make them part of the bill. 1 O. S. 386; 12 Bull 68, and so de
scribed as to leave no doubt of their identity, 1 O. S. 409 ; but
where such papers are used without objection in the circuit
court, and the defendant in error afterwards prosecutes a peti
tion in error in the supreme court, he can not there object that
they are no part of the bill, 7 O. S. 23. Before a paper purport
ing to be a bill of exceptions can be regarded by a reviewing
court, upon error, as part of the record, it must appear from the
record, outside of such paper, that a bill of exceptions was in
due time tendered to and allowed, etc., by the court and made
part of the record, and the paper in question must be identified
-with reasonable certainty as the bill of exceptions which was
thus made part of the record, 27 O. S. 597.
§ 5300. How to be taken when facts appear of record.
"When the decision objected to is entered on the record,
and the grounds of objection appear in the entry, the
exception may be taken by the party causing to be noted
at the end of the entry that he excepts. [51 v. 57, § 293;
S.&C.1029.]
But a journal entry is not a substittite for a bill of exceptions,
31 O. S. 431. Where parties have consented to an entry showing
that the bill was duly perfected they are estopped from showing
it w as untrue, 31 O. ia. i03 ; see 2 C. C. K. 152, 155.
§ 5301. When bill of exceptions may be taken. When
the decision is not entered on the record, or the grounds
of objection do not sufficiently appear in the entry, or
the exception is to the opinion of the court on a motion
to direct a non-suit, to arrest the testimony from the
jury (1), or for a new trial for misdirection by the court
to the jury (2), or because the verdict, or, if a jury is
waived, the finding of the court is against the law and the
evidence (3), or the omission or rejection of evidence,
the party excepting must reducehisexceptionsto writing, and present the same 1o the trial judge, or judges, for
allowance within thirty days from the end of the term
at which the verdict is rendered, or the finding of the
court is made (4); provided further that in case the trial
judge or judges be absent from the district when such
bill of exceptions is so prepared for allowance, then the
same may be deposited with the clerk of the court for
the examination and allowance of such trial judge or
judges, who shall be required to sign and seal said bill
of exceptions on or before the first day of the next
ensuing term of court. [85 v. 181, 84 v. 69.]
1. 17 O. 439 ; 24 O. S. 83 (act 1858) ; 38 O. S. 389 ; 1 C. C. R. 9. 2,
See 10 O. S. 223 ; 25 O. S. 584 ; 29 O. S. 418. 3. Beforo the passage of
the act of 1858, the fact that the verdict was against the weightof
the evidence was not ground of reversal, o O. 8. 497. Error will
lie to the ruling of the court upon questions of law where the
case is submitted to the court in the same manner as if it had
been submitted to the jury, 12 O. 482; 15 O. 58 ; 17 O. 128, 131 ; 14
O. S. 372. When a jury is waived, and issues of fact are submit
ted to the court, with a request to have conclusions of faetfound
separately from conclusions of law, a question as to the suffi
ciency of evidence upon which findings of fact were made by
the court can only be raised by bill of exceptions, 30 O. S. 92. 4.
Party must reduce exceptions to writing and present same, etc.,
for allowance within thirty days from end of term, etc. Enti
tled to entry of allowance, etc., placed on journal, 3 C. C. R. 393.
§ 5302. Allowance, signing, and record. If the ex
ception be true, or, if it be not true, then after it is cor
rected (1) the trial judge or a majority (2) of the judges
composing the court must allow and sign it before the
case proceeds (3), or, if the party consents within thirty
days alter the term (4); or in case of the absence of the
trial judge or judges from the district, as provided in the
preceding section, then on or before the first day of the
next ensuing term. The bill of exceptions shall be
filed (5) with the pleadings, and, if the party request it,
made a part of the record, but not spread upon the
journal; and if it is to be signed after the term, the
journal must be kept open, and the allowance and sign
ing thereof entered thereon as of the term (6). [85 v. 182.]
1. 20 O. 119. The reviewing court, however, can not amend
the record, 27 O. S. 4-i. A bill of exceptions regularly signed, etc-,
is conclusive upon everything therein contained, 5 Hull 14. 2.
W. 73; though the record does not show they were present
at the trial, 28 O. S. 554. When signed by only one of the three
judges composing the court it will be disregarded, though
the journal eutry recites that it is allowed aud signed, etc., 44
O. fl. B9 ; 15 Bull 171 : see 43 O. S. 63. Signing by two judges ill
held sufficient under Swan's Stat. 676. when the court was
equally divided, 18 O. 266. 8. It must be signed, 43 O. S. 68.
Presenting the bill at the trial term is not sufficient, 13 O. S. 271.
Mandamus is the proper remedy to compel its allowance, etc., 43
O. S. 16. The application for mandamusshould be accompanied
by the bill, 22 O. S. 207. Where the answer shows that defendant
is willing to sign a true bill, and denies that the bill presented
is a true one, the writ will be refused, Id. 4 (i. 351 ; but where
an alternate writ of mandamus commands a judge of an in
ferior court to allow and sign a certain bill of exceptions filed
with the petition in the case and averred to be true, and
which was tendered to him in due time, or to show cause why
he does uot sign the same, and he fails to answer, or answers
and fails to show a sufficient cause, the peremptory writ should
command him to sign the particular bill named. 43 O. s. 16;
Mcllvaine, C. J., and Okey, J., dissenting. Formerly the stiitute
required the bill to be sealed as well as signed, 73 v. 140: 85
O. S. 482. That is also uecessary now ; see il 5301 us amended,
85 v. 181. 4. By the "party" who may consent to the
extension for thirty days is meant the party who excepts, 48
O. S. 23. Before the enactment of this section, where the bill of
exceptions was taken after the trial term, upon the overruling
of a motion for a new trial, the judgment would not be reversed
for errors occurring at the trial, unless It appeared from the
whole record that the verdict was contrarv to the law or evi
dence, 29 O. S. 557 ; 32 O. S. 258, 415. 6. A t the trial term, 82 O. S.
415, or thirty days thereafter, 5 Bull 852 ; 9 Kic 482. The record
is conclusive as to the time of filing, 6 O. 6. 12. An omission to
file the bill with the clerk during the term will not invalidate
it. " When duly perfected and ordered to be made part of the
record, it is in law to he regarded as part of the record whether
it comes Into the actual possession of the clerk during the term
or not," 31 O. S. 103. 6. The allowance and execution must
appear In the journal, 26 O. S. 643 ; 27 O. S. 597 ; 40 O. S. 112. 113,
of the term at which the case was tried and terminated, 36 O. S.
614; 12 Bull 286; but the necessary entry may be supplied bya
nunc pro tunc order, 37 O. S. 147; 40 O. S. 110, 111. The date of
allowance should be shown by the bill, 8 O. 117 ; see 3 O. C. R. 393.
§ 5303. Immaterial exceptions. No exception shall
be regarded unless it is material and prejudicial to the
substantial rights of the party excepting. [51 v. 57,
§ 295 ; S. & C. 1029.]
Prejudice must be shown, 21 O. S. 536, 540; 33 O. S. 444; 15
O. S. 511 ; 11 O. S. 114; 2 0. S. 570. A bill of exceptions can not
be taken before arbitrators, 42 O. S. 543; nor i.i an agreed case
under § 5207, 22 O. S. 149; nor under M 95, 96 and 97, relating to
fugitives from justice, 34 O. S. 316. The provisions providing
for exceptions have no application to final judgments or orders,
26 O. S. 372 ; 12 O. S. 402.
§ 5304. Withdrawing exceptions. Exceptions taken
to the decision of a court of record may, by leave of
such court, be withdrawn from the fihs by the party
taking the same, at any time before proceedings in error are commenced, and before the exceptions are recorded.
[51 v. 57, § 296 ; S. & C. 1030.]
§ 5305. Causes for which a new trial will he granted.
A new trial is a re-examination, in the same court, of an
issue of fact, after a verdict by a jury, a report of a
referee or master, or a decision by the court ; and the
former verdict, report, or decision, shall be vacated, and
a new trial granted, on the application of the party
aggrieved, for any of the following causes affecting mate
rially the substantial rights of such party :
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury,
referee, master, or prevailing party, or any order of the
court or referee, or abuse of discretion, by which the
party was prevented from having a fair trial.
2. Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party.
3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence
could not have guarded against.
4. Excessive damages, appearing to have been given
under the influence of passion or prejudice.
5. Error in the assessment of the amount of recovery,
whether too large, or too small, when the action
is upon a contract, or for the injury or detention of
property.
6. That the verdict, report, or decision is not sustained
by sufficient evidence, or is contrary to law.
7. Newly discovered evidence, material for the party
applying, which he could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered, and produced at the trial.
8. Error of law occurring at the trial, and excepted
to by the party making the application. [51 v. 57,
§ 297 ; S. & C. 1030.]
1. Irregularities, ete. it lias been held not good ground for a
new trial that papers not in the case were permitted to be taken
by the jury in their retirement, where no prejudice could have
resulted therefrom, 11 Bull 166; where a paper containing a
computation of interest went to the jury, with other papers in
the case, when it did not appear by whom it was given, and
where no fraudulent intent was shown, 2 O. S. 431; because
computations of an engineer were allowed to be given to the jury
in a proceeding to appropriate private property, 32 O. S. 215 ;
because file judge presiding at the trial ofa prisoner for murder sent to the jury on their request, in the absence of the prisoner,
a copy of the statutes calling their attention to the sections
relating to homicide, 11 O. S. 114; because the bailiff went to
the jury room after the retirement of the jury, where it was not
shown that the jury were influenced by his presence, 4 Bull 576,
578. "It is unnecessary to determine whether the act of the
sheriff and his deputy, who had testified in the cause on behalf
of the state, in remaining in the room where the jury were
deliberating, affords of itself ground of reversal, but we all
unite in condemning such acts," 36 O. S. 195,200, 201. Comments
of an attorney in the case have been held not good ground, 3
Bull 431 ; 6 Bull 752; 18 O. S. 366, or that an attorney concealed
facts from a witness, 39 O. S. 37. Communications with jurors
by the court after the case has been submitted to them, and
while they have it under consideration, except in open court,
furnish ground for a new trial, 1 Pick. 242; 13 Johns. 487. Mis
conduct of witnesses for state, 15 Bull 238.
2. Misconduct ofjury, it has been held good ground for a new
trial that jurors conversed on the subject of the case, while in
their room, with persons on the street, 2 O. S. 54 ; (the rule is
that such conversations as have a tendency to influence the ver
dict are sufficient to authorize the granting of a new trial, U
Bull 278, citing 41 Conn. 269; 62 Me. 302; 36 N. J. L. 24; but
where they have no relevancy to the case or consist of state
ments made by the jurors themselves, they will not have this
effect, 11 Bull 278, citing 3 Neb. 357; 26 Ark. 323; 13 Conn. 445);
because a juror asked favors of plaintifff during the trial, 5 Bull
29 ; because jurors in a criminal case, without the knowledge of
the court or prisoner, obtained part of the charge of the court
as printed in a newspaper and used it in their deliberations,
2 O. S. 64; because one juror personated another in a criminal
case, 34 O. S. 228, disclosed facts to fellow-jurors within his own
knowledge contradicting important testimony, 42 O. S. 426;
because iheiury read depositions rejected by the court, 1 D. 21,
made experiments by imitating signature during trial of action
on note where defense was forgery, 2 Clev. R. 164; because a
juror expressed his opinion before the trial of a criminal case,
19 O. 198, but not where evidence of the fact was conflicting, 23
O. S. 146, or not supported by affidavit that the fact was unknown,
4 O. S. 234; because the jury altered their verdict after it was
sealed, 8 O. 405; because a juror separated from his fellows after
final submission of a criminal case, and before verdict, and
drank intoxicating liquors, 22 O. S. 486. It has been held not
good ground for a new trial that jurors separated in a civil case
after having agreed on their verdict, 3 O. 53 ; sealed verdict, 8 O.
405; where the separation was induced by an alarm of tire in
the vicinity, 33 O. S. 77; because a juror drank intoxicating
liquor during an adjournment, unless there wns reason to sus
pect it may have had some influence on the final result, 32 O. S.
328; because a juror was asleep while one of the witnesses was
testifying and one of the attorneys making his argument, the
court's attention not being called to the fact, 12 Neb. 5 ; because
of improper and officious interference by the officer having the
jury in charge, unless it led to misbehavior on the part ot the
jury, 10 O. 459; see 36 O. S. 195, 200 ; 4 Bull 576 ; because a juror
viewed the premises alone, 2 C. S. C. R. 132; said, during the
progress of the case, that his opinion was formed, 12 Bull 182; expressed a hypothetical opinion before trial in a criminal case
as to guilt or innocence of accused, 10 O. S. 599 ; inquired of an
attorney, not in the case, how he was to get along without certain
papers, and was told to do the best he could l that he, the attor
ney, could give him no advice, and that the juror could send up
and have the court advise them, 33 O. S. 77 ; that a witness called
by the jury repeated his testimony in the jury-room, T. 274.
Affidavits of jurors are not admissible to impeach their verdict,
10 O. 459, unless other testimony is first given, 2 O. S. 54; 42
O. S. 426. Affidavits stating that they misunderstood the charge
will not be received on motion to set aside the verdict, 8 O. S. 384.
Misconduct of prevailing party. Any attempt ou the part of
prevailing party, or his attorney in the case, to corrupt a juror,
though it is not shown to be successful, is a good gronnd for a
new trial, 32 O. S. 328. Where it appears that, during the pro
gress of a trial, the prevailing party, or his attorney, has fur
nished intoxicating liquors to a juror, it is a good ground for a
new trial, unless it was clearly shown that it was not intended
to influence his action in the case, and that it had no influence
on his mind as a juror, Id.; see 5 Bull 875. When the prevailing
party testifies on the trial in his own behalf, and, upon crossexamination, refuses to answer, and the trial proceeds, such
refusal is misconduct for which the verdict should be set aside
and a new trial granted, 4 W. L. M. 159.
3. Accident. Surprise. The submission of a case for trial by
the attorney without notice to the client, is no ground for a new
trial, though the client is thereby deprived of furnishing addi
tional testimony, 1 D. 411. The surprise of a party arising from
unexpected statements of a witness who had been twice before
examined without disclosing facts to which he testifies, is not
sufficient ground for a new trial when the verdict isjustified by
other evidence and substantial justice is done, 2 O. S. 588. A
motion for a new trial on the ground that counsel were led by
a misapprehension of the law to abstain from offering evidence
pertinent to the issues made therein, is addressed to the sound
discretion of the court, and its action thereon is not subject to
review, 16 O. S. 88. See generally, 2 O. S. 164; 2 Bull 113; 5 Bull
353; 1 Clev. R. 178. Defendant In default because papers were
taken out by plaintifff, 1 Clev. R. 194 ; entering judgment in vio
lation of agreement, 4 Bull 289.
4. Excessive damages. In actions for slander and libel, a new
trial will not be granted unless the amount is so large as to show
partiality, corruption, or improper influence of the jury, 13 O.
305 ; 14 O. 418. Th e party in whose favor an excessive amoun t is
found may remit the excess, and a motion for a new trial on that
ground will be overruled, 9 O. S. 72; 28 O. S. 175; 2 D. 403. The
court may make a remittitur of the excess a condition of refus
ing to grant a new trial, 22 O. S. 446. A corporation, by the ma
licious misconduct of its servants or agents acting within the scope
of their employment, may render itself liable to exemplary or
punitive damages; but, this doctrine being capable of great
practical abuse, the giving it in a charge to the jury in a case
clearly not warranting its application, tends to mislead them;
and where, in such a case, a verdict for damages is obviously
exorbitant, it is error in the court to refuse to set it aside, ana
award a new trial, 19 O. S. 157.
5. Error in assessment of amount of recovery. Where in a suit
== for foreclosure of a mortgage an excessive amount is found due
by reason of an erroneous method of calculating interest, and
this is not discovered until after the term, a petition for a new
trial lies under this section, 6 Bull 755.
6. Verdict contrary to law, etc. The verdict must be clearly
against the evidence to warrant its being set aside, 6 O. 456 ; 4
O.S.566; 12 O. S. 146; 5 O.S.266 ; 35 O.S. 370; 18 O.S.134; 35 O.S.
253. A mere difference of opinion between the court and jury is
not a sufficient ground, 8 O. 507 ; 5 O. S. 266 ; 4 O. S. 666.
7. Newly discocered evidence. The newly discovered evidence
must require a different verdict, 4 O. 5 ; 24 O. S. 133. It must not
be cumulative, 11 O. 147; 10 O. S. 598; 1 D. 115; 15 O. 313. The
evidence must be such as could not with reasonable diligence
have been discovered and produced at the trial, 20 O. S. 150, 163.
It is not a test that evidence is cumulative, that affidavits in sup
port of it do not go to some new ground of defense, 2 C. S. C. R.
18. Evidence discovered after motion made is admissible. 35
O. S. 177. Error does not lie to overruling motion on this ground
uuderS.iSiS.1155; 26 O. S. 1. Made at trial term, 2 C. C. R. 541.
8. Error of law. The exception must be made at the time the
decision is rendered, 10 O. S. 223. A new trial will be granted
when competent evidence has been rejected which would con
duce to prove the issue, 6 O. 87, 91 ; where from the whole record
the Courtis of opinion that the direction of the judge, though
in terms correct, might have been misunderstood by the jury,
12 O. S. 312; where improper evidence is admitted, and of such
a character that It might have influenced the jury, 8 O. 81, 84. A
new trial will not be granted because the court gave a wrong
reason for rightly rejecting testimony, 4 O.5; because improper
evidence was admitted when it was merely cumulative, and
when the jury must have found the facts as they did without it,
3 O. 107; because the court commented ou the evidence in its
charge to the jury, 6 O. 164 ; erred as to evidence which could
not change the result, 6 O. 87, or in its charge as to the law, 1 O.
330, 349; 5 O. S. 375, 385. A new trial will not be granted on a
technical ground, orto let in a technical defense, where substan
tial justice Is done by the verdict, 1 O. 357 ; 5 O. 109. If the ground
of the motion is, that improper testimony was admitted, such
fact must be made distinctly to appear, 15 O. 735. See, generally,
40 O. S. 339 ; 2 C. C. R. 51^
§ 5306. For what causes new trial will not be granted.
A new trial shall not be granted on account of the smallness of damages, in an action for an injury to the person
or reputation, nor in any other action where the damages
equal the actual pecuniary injury sustained. [51 v. 51,
§ 298 ; S. & C. 1032.]
See 1 H. 438.
§ 6307. When application for new trial to be made.
The application for a new trial must be made at the
term the verdict, report, or decision is rendered; and,
except for the cause of newly discovered evidence, ma
terial for the party applying, which he could not with
reasonable diligence have discovered, and produced at the trial, shall be made within three days after the ver
dict or decision is rendered, unless such party is una
voidably prevented from filing the same within such
time. [51 v. 57, \ 299 ; S. & C. 1033.]
The motion must be made within three days after the verdict,
etc., 21 O. S. 637, or it is of no avail, 3 Neb. 446; 6 Neb. 532. When
a party has filed a motion for a new trial, and afterwards with
draws it and prays the court to proceed to enter up judgment,
he can not of right file a second motion, although the three days
after the rendition of the judgment have not expired, 2 W. L.
M. 554 ; see 2 C. C. R. 541 ; 3 Id. 581.
§ 5308. How application for new trial made. The ap
plication must be made by motion, upon written grounds,
filed at the time of making the motion ; the causes enu
merated in subdivisions two, three, and seven, of \ 5305,
must be sustained by affidavits or depositions, showing
their truth, and may be controverted by affidavits or
depositions, and for this purpose depositions may also be
taken in the county where the action is pending. [77 v.
48; 51 v. 57, \ 300; 76 v. 99, H; S. & C. 1033.]
The motion may be made by both parties, 26 O. S. 632. The
grounds must be stated in the motion, 15 O. S. 211, 215.
§ 5309. Application for new trial after term. When
the grounds for a new trial could not, with reasonable
diligence, have been discovered before, but are discov
ered after, the term at which the verdict, report, or de
cision was rendered or made, the application may be
made by petition, filed as in other cases, not later than
the second term after the discovery; whereupon a sum
mons shall issue, and be returnable and served, or publi
cation made, as prescribed in \ 5050 ; the facts stated in
the petition shall be considered as denied without answer;
if the service be complete in vacation, the case shall be
heard and summarily decided at the ensuing term, and
if in term, it shall be heard and decided after the expi
ration of twenty days from such service; and the case
shall be placed on the trial docket, and the witnesses
shall be examined in open court, or their depositions
taken, as in other cases; but no such petition shall be
filed more than one year after the final judgment was
rendered. [51 v. 57, \ 301 ; S. & C. 1033.]
See 35 O. S. 177. Allegations must be affirmatively stated, and
not upon information, 7 Neb. 18!i ; the petition is demurrable, Id.
A mere allegation that the error was not discovered until after
the term at which the judgment was rendered, where two terms
have passed since then, is bad on demurrer, 6 Bull 755.
§ 5310. Definition of judgment and order. A judg
ment is the final determination of the rights of the par
ties in action ; and a direction of a court or judge, made
or entered in writing, and not included in a judgment,
is an order. [51 v. 57, 370, 509 ; S. & C. 1099.]
The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, though
erroneous, is binding until reversed, 6 O. 87 ; 9 O. 37 ; 11 O. 257 ;
17 O. S. 319; of a justice, 6 O. S. 302; of a foreign court, when de
fendant is served with process, 1 O. 259 ; 5 O. 545 ; 6 O. 43, and
can not be collaterally Impeached, 5 O. 522 ; 12 O. 253 ; 15 O. 447 ;
20 O. 344 (though service is had on only part of defendants, and
judgment is against all, 16 O. 271 ; though service is by publica
tion on residents, 16 O. S. 177), except in cases of fraud or mis
take, 18 O. S. 225; 13 O. S. 446; 17 O. S. 242. " But the rule laid
down in regard to impeaching judgments collaterally is this,
that ' the parties to an action can not impeach or set at naught
the judgment in any collateral proceedings on the ground that
it was obtained by fraud or collusion,' " 1 C. C. R. 212; but one
not a party to such judgment has a right to collaterally impeach
it whenever, in any case, it is attempted to be enforced against
him or to prejudice his rights, Id. The jurisdiction of the courts
of common pleas of our own state will be presumed where the
record is silent upon the subject, 18 O. 535, and jurisdiction of
the person will be presumed, though the fact may not affirma
tively appear on the record, 20 O. 344 But the jurisdiction of
the court rendering the judgment may always be inquired into
when such judgment is made the foundation of the action, for
eign or domestic, 33 O. S. 230, and the want of jurisdiction may
be shown either as to the subject matter, the person, or in pro
ceedings in rem as to the thing, 27 O. S. 600. Where it affirma
tively appears in the record that the defendant was not served
with process, or otherwise legally notified, the court has no juris
diction, 1 O. S. 369, and want of jurisdiction renders a judgment
void, 15 O. 435; contra, when court finds jurisdiction, 13 O. S.
446 ; 35 Id. 550 ; 39 Id. 366 ; 43 Id. 78.
§ 5311. Judgment may be for or against one or more of
several plaintifffs or defendants. Judgment may be given
for or against one or more of several plaintiffts, and for
or against one or more of several defendants; and by
the judgment the court may determine the ultimate
rights of the parties on either side, as between them
selves, and grant to the defendant any affirmative relief
to which he is entitled. [51 v. 57, § 371 ; S. & C. 1048.]
The common law rule that where a joint contract is the sub
ject of an action, the recovery must be against all or neither of
the defendants, has been modified by this section so as to authorize judgment to bo rendered " for or against one or more
of several defendants," where it turns out upon the trial that
only one or more' of several defendants in such joint action is
liable, without subjecting the plaintifff to the necessity of bring
ing a new action against such defendant or defendants, 10 O. S.
451. Where a separate action might have been maintained, a
separate judgment is proper, 2fi O. S. 141 ; as against drawer and
acceptor, Id.; maker and indorser, 2 Bull 18; and in ejectment
against several who defend jointly, judgment may be rendered
for or against one or more of them. 83 O. S. 395. The section
" has no legitimate bearing on the right to commence a several
suit upon a cause of action confessedly joint. It relates to the
termination and not to the commencement of a suit, and before it
can be applied, the testimony must show that the real cause of
action was several and not joint," 14 O. S. 291 ; see 44 O. S. 318, 334.
§ 5312. Court may render judgment against one or
more, leaving action to proceed against others. In an
action against several defendants, the court may render
judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action
to proceed against the others, whenever a several judg
ment is proper. [51 v. 57, § 371 ; S. & C. 1048.]
As against maker and indorser, 1 H. 77; 2 Bull 18; in an ac
tion against two defendants for money on an account, where it
appears, a several judgment is proper, 33 O. S. 312; but where a
joint suit against all the obligors or contractors is the only rem
edy, it is error for the court to render a several judgment against
one or more of the defendants, leaving the action to proceed
against the others, 23 O. S. 543; s. p. 1 C. C. R. 72. In an action
against three defendants, where judgment is rendered against
two, the third is not a necessary party in proceedings in error, 36
O. S. 400.
§ 5313. Court may dismiss for want of prosecution.
The court may dismiss the petition with costs, in favor
of one or more defendants, in case of unreasonable
neglect on the part of the plaintifff to serve the summons
on other defendants, or to proceed in the cause against
the defendant or defendants served. [51 v. 57, \ 371 ;
S. & C. 1048.]
§ 5314. When action may he dismissed without preju
dice. An action may be dismissed without prejudice to
a future action :
1. By the plaintifff, before the final submission of the
case to the jury, or to the court, when the trial is by the
court.
2. By the court, where the plaintifff fails to appear on
the trial.
3. By the court, for the want of necessary parties.
4. By the court, on the application of some of the defendants, where there are others whom the plaintifff* fails
to prosecute with diligence.
5. By the court, for disobedience by the plaintifff of an
order concerning the proceedings in the action.
6. By the plaintifff, in vacation, on payment of costs ;
and the clerk, in such case, shall forthwith make an
entry thereof on the journal, whereupon the dismissal
shall take effect; but this clause shall not apply to a
petition in error, or a case in which a counterclaim or
set-off has been filed.
In all other cases the decision must be upon the
merits, upon the trial of the action. [51 v. 57, § 372 ;
59 v. 39; S. & C. 1049; S. & S. 601.]
1. Where a general demurrer to a petition is sustained, and
leave to amend is given, but the plaintifff, instead of amending,
discontinues the action, there is no judgment that bars another
suit upon the same cause of action, 4 O. S. 566; but the submis
sion of a case ou demurrer to the answer, on the ground that it
does not contain a defense, is a final submission of the case,
within the meaning of this section, unless leave is obtained to
reply or amend ; and the plaintifff can not, if the demurrer is
overruled, without leave of court, dismiss his action without
prejudice, 24 O. S. 445. When a judgment is reversed and the
cause remanded for further proceedings, and the plaintifff in the
court below then voluntarily becomes non-suit, he is not es
topped from bringing a new action, 15 O. S. 464 ; but plaintifff
can not, in a proceeding for the contest of a will, defeat the con
test by dismissing his petition where either of the defendants
in his answer joins in the praver that the will be set aside us in
valid. 20 O. S. 208. Where the court, finding on the trial that
the plaintifff had not proved his case, gave him until the next
day to obtain more testimony to prevent being non-suited, and
plaintifff failed to rind more testimony, it was held not error to
refuse to allow plaintifff to dismiss without prejudice on the
next day, 9 Rec. 276, 377; 5 Bull 816; generally, 1 Bull 332,
3. See 38 O. S. 314, 318.
4. Dismissal of injunction without prejudice, 44 O. S. 221 ; 15
Bull 300.
6. " But this clause shall not apply to a petition in error," 22
O. S. 206, " or a case in which a counterclaim or set-off has been
filed," 14 O. S. 31 ; see 2 C. S. C. R. 258, 538 ; but where the alle
gations of an answer are not such as to entitle defendant to
affirmative relief, such answer does not present a counterclaim,
which the defendant has a right to have tried after the plaint
iff's cause Vf action has been dismissed without prejudice, 30
O. S. 126. " In all other cases the decision m ust be upon the mer
its" etc. Where it appears that a dismissal was upon a hearing
of the case, it is to be inferred that it was upon the merits, 4 O. S.
251 ; but where the record of a former suit was pleaded in bar,
and the record of such former suit was silent as to whether the
dismissal was upon the merits or for want of prosecution, it was
held there was no presumption either way, and the consequence
was that, as it must be established that the dismissal was upon the merits, there was no bar, Id. And where it did not appear
that the case came within the grounds mentioned in this section,
the court having rendered a judgment dismissing an action
without prejudice, it was held such judgment of dismissal was
an entirety, and though it might have been erroneously ren
dered, it would not constitute a bar to a subsequent action* upon
the same subject matter, 30 O. S. 378; see 23 O. S. 560 ; 44 O. S.
223. The court may, in a proper case, arrest the testimony from
the jury and render judgment for defendant. The judgment in
such case, however, has not the effect of a non-suit at common
law, but is, under this section, an action upon the merits, 24
O. S. 83 ; but if there is evidence tending to support the issue,
the court has no power to arrest the case from the jury and enter
a non-suit, 11 O. S. 362; 24 O. S. 83. It is only where no evidence
is introduced by the plaintifff tending to support the issue, or
where it is such as to snow clearly that he has no causeof action,
that it is the duty of the court to direct judgment of non suit, 38
O. S. 380, 393. A judgment of a mayor's court dismissing an
action without prejudice, on the ground that the testimony does
not sustain the action, is unauthorized and erroneous, 31 O S.
463 (under justice's code). By answer and trial defendant
waives an order of dismissal, 10 O. S. 621. Under the former
practice the action of the court in arresting the testimony from
the jury and rendering judgment for defendant did not operate
as a bar to a subsequent suit, being a non-suit, as at common
law, 4 O. S. 309, 628 ; 11 O. 452; 19 0. 426; see under former prac
tice, 11 O. 290; 12 O. 35; 14 O. 606; 18 O. 72. The dismissal of a
bill to foreclose a mortgage was no bar to a suit on the note se
cured thereby, 10 O. 300.
§ 5315. When set-off or counterclaim is pleaded. If
a set-off or counterclaim be pleaded, the defendant shall
have the right of proceeding to the trial of his claim,
although the plaintifff has dismissed his action, or fails
to appear. [51 v. 57, ? 373 ; S. & C. 1050.]
14 O. S. 31 ; see § 5314, subd. 6n.; 6 Bull 834.
§ 5316. Sale of mortgaged property. When a mort
gage is foreclosed, a sale of the premises shall be or
dered ; and when the premises to bj sold are in one or
more tracts, the court may direct the officer who makes
the sale to subdivide, appraise, and sell the same in par
cels, or to sell any one of the tract; as a whole. [67 v.
114, § 374; 76 v. 27, §7.]
See \ 5021. Parties in foreclosure, sec ' \ 5005. 5006, notes, mort
gage. Pleadings, notes, H 50C,0, 5070. Jurisdiction over person
and property necessary, 1 O. S. 360. As betweeu successive pur
chasers in fee, and for full value of separate parcels of land in
cumbered by a prior mortgage on the whole, a sale of the same
to satisfv the mortgage will be made in the inverse order of
alienation, 42 O. S. 30.V; see 14 O. 365 ; 20 Bull 397.
§ 5317. Proceedings where mortgaged property is situ
ated in more than one county. When the mortgaged property is situated in more than one county, the court
may order the sheriff, or master, of each to make sale of
the property in his county, or may direct one officer to
sell the whole; the court may direct that the property,
when it consists of a single tract, be sold as one tract, or
in separate parcels, and shall direct whether appraisers
shall be selected for each county, or one set for all ; and
shall also direct whether publication of the sale shall he
made in all the counties, or in one countv onlv. [67 v.
114, §374.]
§ 5318. When judgment to operate as a conveyance.
'When a party against whom a judgment for a convey
ance, release, or acquittance is rendered, dots not com
ply therewith by the time appointed, such judgment
shall have the same operation and effect, and be as
available, as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance
had been executed conformably to such judgment. [51
v. 57, §375; S. & C. 1051.]
The reversal of a decree divests the title, as between the par
ties, but not as to bona fide purchasers, 3 O. 337. Having acquired
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the court may en
force its decree by attachment, whether the lands ordered to be
conveyed lie within or without the state, 14 O. S. 302 ; 24 O. S.
474; see 4 O.425.
§ 5319. Judgment against married woman. When a
married woman sues, or is sued, like proceedings shall
be had, and judgment rendered and enforced, as if she
were unmarried, and her property and estate shall be
liable for the judgment against her ; but she shall be en
titled to the benefits of all exemptions to heads of fam
ilies. [81 v. 65; 71 v. 47, § 28.]
See 1 4996. Before the last amendment this section read,
" and her separate property shall beliable," etc.; see, under prior
statutes, 36 O. S. 79 ; 43 O. S. 171; see 21 Bull 115; 40 O. s.
§ 5320. Assessment of damages upon default. When
all or a part of one or more of the causes of action are
not put in issue by answer, judgment may be taken, as
upon a default, for so much of the plaintifff's demand as
is not put in issue by the answer, upon any or all the
causes of action, without prejudice to the rights of the plaintifff as to that portion of his demand disputed ; and
if, in the determination of any cause, the taking an ac
count, proof of a fact, or the assessment of damages, is
necessary, the court may take the account, hear the proof,
or assess the damages, or may refer the case to a referee
or master for such purpose, or direct the matter to be
ascertained by a jury, as the case may require. [69 v.
44, 1 376 ; 51 v. 57, § 598 ; 76 v. 78, §1 ; S. & C. 1130.]
Where a party takes judgment by default for a less sum than
the amount due on his claim, he can not maintain an action to
recover the remainder, 20 O. S. 315. Judgment on default may be
taken for the part of the account admitted, and the case con
tinued as to the remainder, 26 O. S. 537; but the section applies
only where a part of the cause or causes of action is admitted
and partdenied, 37O. S. 363; see 1 C. C. R. 290; and where plaint
iff sues to recover the value of services rendered, and defendant
admits the rendition of the services, but denies the value to be
as great as claimed, and avers it does not exceed a certain speci
fied amount, it is error to render a judgment in plaintifff's favor
for such amount, and continue the cause for trial to determine
the further value of such services, Id. Where defendant admits
the debt and pleads a set-off, judgment may be taken for the dif
ference, 34 O. S. 294. Judgment by default can not be taken
against an infant, 8 O. 377 ; 1 O. S. 544 ; 17 Id. 484; it can not be
taken before a case is placed on the trial docket, 34 O. S. 123,
before the expiration of the day named in the summons for an
swer, Id. Judgment by default without proof is erroneous in an
action to rescind a contract and recover back purchase money,
1 Clev. R. 90 ; in an action for a demand not founded on contract,
express or implied, where the averments of the petition are ad
mitted by demurrer, 2 C. C. R. 143; but judgment by default
without proof in an action on an account is not erroneous. 25
O. S. 635. Judgment by default may be taken after appearance,
T. 45, at a subsequent term, on demurrer sustained to an answer
at a previous term, 3 Bull 891, 895. Default for answer may be
set aside where a meritorious defense is shown on payment of
costs by defendant, 1 H. 190; can not be set aside without leave,
2 Bull 97; nor at subsequent term, 2 H. 178; but the opening of
a default is discretionary with the court. 1 Clev. R. 341 ; 2 Id. 97.
Special demurrer can not be pleaded after default, T. 183. On
default, plaintifff may waive jury and have court assess damages,
2 Clev. R. 114, 299. Right to jury, 22 O. S. 372.
CHAPTER III.
JUDGMENT BY CONFESSION.
§ 5321. Confession of judgment in person. A person
indebted, or against whom a cause of action exists, may
personally appear, in a court of competent jurisdiction,
and, with the assent of the creditor, or person having
such cause of action, confess judgment; whereupon judg merit shall be entered accordingly. [51 v. 57, $ 377;
S. & C. 1052.]
§ 5322. Pleadings in such action. The debt or cause
of action shall be briefly stated in the judgment, or in a
writing to be filed as pleadings in other actions. [51 v.
57J378; S. & C. 1053.]
\\ 5321, 5322 apply only to a proceeding wherein the liebtor
appears personalty in court and confesses judgment, 35 O. S. 107.
§ 5323. Enforcement of judgment. Release of errors.
Such judgment shall authorize the same proceedings for
its enforcement as judgments rendered in actions regu
larly brought and prosecuted; and the confession shall
operate as a release of errors. [51 v. 57, \ 379 ; S. & C. 1 053.]
§ 5324. Warrant of attorney to be produced and filed.
An attorney who confesses judgment in any case shall, at
the time of making such confession, produce the warrant
' of attorney for making the same to the court before
which he makes the confession; and the original or a
copy of the warrant shall be filed with the clerk of such
court. [51 v. 57, \ 380; S. & C. 1053.]
This section does not dispense with a petition or its verification;
but where the warrant of attorney, under which a confession of
judgment is made, authorizes the waiving of process, and the
release of all errors, and the judgment is rendered upon a good
cause of action stated in a petition not properly verified, the
defect in the verification on a proceeding in error must be
deemed to have been waived, 31 O. S. 435, 436. A warrant of at
torney to confess judgment must be strictly construed, and the
authority conferred can not be exercised beyond the limits ex
pressed in the instrument, 19 O. S. 536; 11 Bull 51 ; 2 C. C. R. 43.
A warrant of attorney to confess judgment does not authorize
such confession before the maturity of the note, 33 O. S. 236. A
warrant of attorney to confess judgment against a principal and
surety authorizes judgment against principal alone, 3 O. S. 445.
It seems that a warrant of attorney may nuthorize judgment in
favor of any holder of the note, 25 O. S. 340, 346; and on a sealed
note, payable to bearer, judgment may be confessed in favor of
the holder, 35 O. S. 141; " but in all the reported cases the power
is expressty conferred to confess a judgment in favor of the tegal
holder or the holder," 2 C. U. R. 43, cit ing 25 O. S. 346 ; 35 O. S. 141.
It was queried whether such warrant could be used for taking
judgment in favor of the indorsee of the note, 11 O. S. 503 ; see
19 O. 130; 19 O. S. 536; and held that it could not if the note was
sealed, 19 O. S. 536. In 19 O. 130 it Was hold the warrant was not
negotiable. That the warrant is not negotiable does not destroy
the negotiability of the note. Id.; and the erasure of the power
of attorney from the note does not invalidate the note, 3 O. S.
445. A warrant to confess judgment upon a debt due directly
from the defendant to the plaintifff is not a collateral security
merging the original debt, 18 O. 279. The taking of a judgment upon a.warrunt of attorney without filing the original warrant,
or a copy thereof, is an irregularity, for which the judgment may
be set aside, 9 O. S. 505 ; see 1 C. C. R. 211 ; 11 O. 417 ; 21 Bull 362.
§ 5325. Warrant of attorney to confess judgment
for person in custody. A warrant of attorney executed
by a person in custody, to confess judgment in favor
of the person at whose suit he is in custody, shall be
of no force unless executed in the presence of an at
torney expressly named by the person in custody, and
signed by him as witness. [51 v. 57, § 381 ; S. & C. 1053.]
§ 5326. Judgment to be entered in conformity to ver
dict. When a trial by jury has been had, judgment
must be entered by the clerk in conformity to the ver
dict, unless the verdict is special, or the court order the
case to be reserved for future argument or consideration.
[51 v. 57, § 382; S. & C. 1054.]
§ 5327. Judgment on special verdict or case reserved.
When the verdict is special, or when there is a special
finding on particular questions of fact, or when the case
is reserved, the court shall order what judgment shall be
entered. [51 v. 57, § 383 ; S. & C. 1054.]
§ 5328. Judgment contrary to verdict. When, upon
the statements in the pleadings, one party is entitled by
law to judgment in his favor, judgment shall be so ren
dered by the court, although a verdict has been found
against such party. [51 v. 57, § 384; S. & C. 1054.]
Judgment non obstante veredicto can only be given for a
plaintifff. The remedy for a defendant is to have the judgment
arrested, 2 O. S. 287. Under the code judgment must be entered
for the defendant, notwithstanding the verdict against him, if
the plaintifff's petition does not set forth a good cause of action,
16 O. S. 129. Where the only issue is upon the truth of imma
terial matter, it is not error to render judgment upon the plead
ings irrespective of the verdict of the jury, 22 O. B. 247. On
motion for judgment for defendant, notwithstanding the ver
dict on the pleadings, the court can only look at the pleadings,
40 O. S. 113. A legal cause of action substantially set forth,
although so inartiflcially stated as to be bad, if specially objected
to by demurrer, is sufficient after verdict, and a judgment ren
dered thereon is good, 7 O. S. 270, 274 : see 19 Bull 270.
§ 5329. When defendant may have judgment. When
a counterclaim or set-off, established at the trial, exceeds the plaintifff's claim so established, judgment for
the defendant must be given for the excess; or, when it
appears that the defendant is entitled to any affirmative
relief, judgment shall be given therefore. [51 v. 57, \ 385 ;
S. & C. 1054.]
41 O. S. 403, 408.
§ 5330. Bights of minors reserved. It shall not be
necessary to reserve in a judgment or order the right of
a minor to show cause against it after attaining the age
of majority; but in any case in which, but for this sec
tion, such reservation would have been proper, the
minor may, within one year after arriving at the age of
majority, show cause against such order or judgment.
[83 v. 74 ; 51 v. 57, \ 386 ; S. & C. 1054.]
See 45 O. S. 93 ; 17 O. S. 484.
§ 5331. Judgments must be entered on journal. All
judgments and orders must be entered on the journal of
the court, and specify clearly the relief granted or order
made in the action. [51 v. 57, § 387 ; S. & C. 1055.]
As an instrument of evidence, the journal is deemed one of
the records of the court, 5 O. 485 ; 6 O. 34.
§ 5332. Record to be made unless waived. The clerk
shall make a complete record of every cause as soon as
it is finally determined, unless such record, or some part
thereof, be duly waived. [51 v. 57, § 388 ; S. & C. 1056.]
§ 5333. When record to be made up and signed. The
clerk shall make up such record in each cause in the
vacation next after the term at which the same was de
termined; and the presiding judge of the court shall, at
the next term thereafter, subscribe the same. [51 v. 57,
§389; S.&C.1056.]
Signature of presiding judge not essential to validity of record,
7 O. (Pt. 1) 212.
§ 5334. What must go into the record. The records
shall be made up from the petition, the process, the re
turn, pleadings subsequent thereto, reports, verdicts, or
ders, judgments, and all material acts and proceedings
of the court ; but if the items of an account, or the copies
of papers attached to the pleadings, are voluminous, the
court may order the record to be made by abbreviating
the same, or inserting a pertinent description thereof, or
by omitting them entirely; and evidence must not be re
corded. [51 v. 57, 1 390 ; S. & C. 1056.]
See 2 C. C. R. 152, 156 ; 7 O. (Pt. 1) -J5;, 258. What shall con
stitute the record of a case is regulated by statute, and any paper
the statute authorizes to become part of the record may be made
part thereof without an express order of the court to that effect,
27 O. S. 44. A reviewing court on error has no control of the
records of the court below, and can not make any changes or
corrections therein, Id. The orders, decrees, and minutes of the
court of common pleas, in those cases in which no final record is
made, or is required to be made, are legal evidence and matter
of record, if the court was in the exercise of its legitimate power
and authority, 6 O.251,253; but entries in dockets or calendars
not required by law to be kept, and entries made by the judge
on his docket, are not evidence of what they contain, but are the
mere statements of the persons making them, 10 O. 198.
§ 5335. Courts to cause records to be completed.
When the judicial acts or other proceedings of any court
have not been regularly brought up and recorded by the
clerk thereof, such court shall cause the same to be made
up and recorded within such time as it may direct ; and
when they are made up, and, upon examination, found
to be correct, the presiding judge shall subscribe the
same. [51 v. 57, § 391 ; S. & (J. 1057.]
§ 5336. Transcribing records. Fees of clerk. A court,
when it deems it necessary, may, by order on the journal,
direct its clerk to transcribe any book in his office into a
new volume, and the transcript so made shall be as valid
as the original ; and for such services the clerk shall re
ceive six cents for each hundred words copied, to be
paid out of the county treasury. [36 v. 15, \ 2 ; S. & C.
1281.]
{) 5337. When complete records need not be made.
§ 5332 fhall not apply :
1. In criminal prosecutions, when the indictment has
been quashed, or when the prosecuting attorney has en
tered a nolle prosequi on the indictment.
2. When the action has been dismissed without preju
dice to a future action, as provided in § 5314.
3. In all actions in which, in open court, at the term
at which the final order or judgment is made, both par
ties declare their agreement that no record shall be
made. [51 v. 57, \ 392; S. & C. 1057.]
§ 5338. When record made upon payment therefore.
When an action has been dismissed without prejudice to
a future action, the clerk shall make a complete record
of the proceedings, upon being paid therefore by the
party requesting it. [51 v. 57, § 393 ; S. & C. 1057.]
§5339. Index to judgments. The clerk shall keep an
index, direct and reverse, of all judgments, by names of
parties alphabetically arranged, showing, in separate
columns, the name of the judgment debtor, the name of
the judgment creditor, the amount of the judgment, and
the year and term when it was rendered, the page of the
journal on which it is entered, the volume and page of
the final record, the number of the suit, the number and
the time of issue of the execution, and satisfaction
thereof, when it appears to have been made. [34 v. 45,
§ 1 ; 36 v. 15, jiI ; S. & C. 1280, 1281.]
See I S42i.
§ 5339a. Court may order general index when none has
been made. Fees of clerk. In any county where a suf
ficient general index has not at any time heretofore been
made, an index such as is required by said original sec
tion [§ 5339] may be made by the clerk, to be appointed
by the court of common pleas of such county, if said court
is of the opinion that the same is needed, and it orders the
same to be made. Application for such order, specifying
the period of time such index is designed to cover, may be
made by the clerk of said court. The clerk making such
index shall receive the same fees for making the same
as is now provided by law for making indices to judg
ments to be paid out of the county treasury in the same
manner as the fees specified in \ 1261. [80 v. 216.]
§ 5339a. How lost or destroyed record supplied or re
placed. Whenever the record required by law of the
proceedings, judgment, or decree in any action, or other
proceeding of any court in this state, in which a final
judgment has been rendered, or any part thereof is lost,
or destroyed by fire, riot, or civil commotion, such court
may, upon the application of any party interested
therein, grant an order authorizing such record, or part
thereof, to be supplied or replaced :
1. By a certified copy of such original record, or part
thereof, when the same can be obtained.
2. By a duly certified copy of the record in the supreme
court of such original record of any action or proceed
ing that may have been removed to the supreme court,
and remain recorded in said supreme court. the original pleadings, entries, papers, and files
in such action or proceeding, when the same can be ob
tained.
4. By an agreement in writing, signed by all the par
ties to such action or proceeding, their representatives or
attorneys, that a substituted copy of such original record
is substantially correct. [81 v. 160.]
The act to supplement § 5339 is made applicable to justice's
and mayor's courts, 83 v. 207. There is no appeal or proceeding
in error from the order of any court in relation to the restora
tion of any lost or destroyed record, document, or other writing,
81 v. 165, 166, and the remedies and rules of evidence provided
by the act are cumulative to those already provided by law. Id.
§ 5339b. Id. In cases not provided for by \ 5339a.
Whenever the record required by law, or any part
thereof, of the proceedings, or judgment, or decree in
any action, or other proceeding of any court in this
state, in which the final judgment has been rendered, is
lost, or destroyed by fire, riot, or civil commotion, and
such loss can not be supplied or replaced as provided in
§ 5339a, any person or party interested therein may
make a written application to the court to which said
record belongs, setting forth the substance of the record
so lost or destroyed, which application shall be verified
in the manner provided for the verification of pleadings
in a civil action, and thereupon summons shall issue,
and actual service, or service by publication, shall be
made upon all persons interested in or affected by said
original judgment or final entry, in the manner provided
by law for the commencement of civil actions, provided
the parties may waive the issuing or service of summons
and enter their appearance to such application ; and
upon the hearing of such application, without further
pleadings, if the court finds that such record has been
lost or destroyed, and that it is enabled by the evidence
produced to find the substance or effect thereof material
to the preservation of the rights of the parties thereto, it
shall make an order allowing a record, which record
shall recite the substance and effect of said lost or de
stroyed record or part thereof, and the same shall there
upon be recorded in said court, and shall have the same
effect as the original record would have if the same had
not been lost or destroyed, so far as it concerns the rights
of the parties so making the application, or persons or parties so served with summons or entering their ap
pearance, or persons claiming under them by a title
acquired subsequently to the filing of the application.
[81 v. 160.]
§ 5339c. Id. Evidence to effect restoration. Upon
the hearing of the application provided in § 53396, the
court may admit in evidence any complete or partial
abstract of such record, docket entries, or indexes, and
any other written evidence of the contents or effect of
such records and published reports concerning such
actions or proceedings, when the court is of opinion that
such abstracts, writings, and publications were fairly
and honestly made before the loss of such records
occurred. [81 v. 161.]
§ 5339d. Id. Proceedings in error or appeal. When
ever a lost or destroyed judgment or order is one to
which either party has a right to a proceeding in error
or appeal, the time intervening between th? tiling of the
application mentioned in section 53396, and the final
order of the court thereon, shall be excluded in com
puting the time within which a petition in error may be
filed or appeal taken as provided by law. [81 v. 161.]
§ 5339e. Costs of restoring lost records. Order for
such restoration. The costs to be taxed upon an appli
cation to restore a lost or destroyed record, shall be the
same as provided for like services in civil actions.
Where the record is lost, or destroyed by fire, riot, or civil
commotion, or other cause, the cost of replacing and re
storing the same, i.s provided in \ 5339a and jj 53396,
Shall be paid out of the county treasury, by order of the
court. And in any case where original papers and rec
ords have been saved from such destruction, riot, civil
commotion, or other cause, and the appearance dockets
have been destroyed, and in cases where such records
saved should be recopied, the court may order that the
clerk of the courts restore such original papers upon the
appearance docket, the recopying of the records, the re
placing of the appearance dockets, indexes thereto, and
such matters as the court shall deem necessary, and the
costs thereof shall be made the same as are provided for
like services in civil actions, and shall be paid out of the
county treasury, by the order of court, to be paid into
the fee fund as other fees. Wrhenever the county commissioners and the clerk of the courts, or a majority of them,
shall be satisfied that any company or persons shall have
true copies of any records they shall deem necessary to
restore, the commissioners of Hamilton county, in con
junction with the clerk of the courts of said county, be,
and they are hereby, authorized to purchase from any
company, persons, or person, having true copies of such
records, copies of such books, or of so much thereof as
they may deem necessary or useful, which copies shall be
transcribed by the clerk to the record books provided for
that purpose in his office. Such books shall be carefully
compared with the original books of any such company,
person, or persons, having the same, in such manner as
the clerk may direct; and on the last page of such books
the person or persons making such comparison shall
make and subscribe an affidavit to the fact of such com
parison having been made, and that such book contains
true copies of the original abstracts. The said books
shall be kept by the county clerk as other records in his
office, and thereafter they, and properly certified tran
scripts therefrom, shall be prima facie evidence, in all
courts of the state, of the truth of the matter therein set
forth. The commissioners, without the approval of the
board of control of said county, for the purpose of de
fraying the expense of said purchase, shall draw their
warrants upon the county treasurer, which shall be paid
from such fund as said commissioners shall designate.
[S2 v. 240; 81 v. 161.]
\\ 528a, 6, c, provide for the restoration o£ the records of the
probate court. 907, 907a, b, e, d, relate to the restoration of
records affecting real estate, 4935a, £,, c, of road records.
CHAPTER V.
JudGMENT FOR COSTS, AND ITS ENFORCEMENT.
ji 5340. When plaintifff must give security for costs.
The plaintifff, if a non-resident of the county in which the
action is brought, or a partnership suing by its company
name, must furnish sufficient security for the costs. The
surety must be a resident of the county and approved
by the clerk, and his obligation shall be complete by
indorsing the summons, or signing his name on the
petition as surety for costs ; he shall be bound for the payment of all costs which may he adjudged against
the plaintifff in the court in which the action is brought,
or in any other court to which -it may be carried, and
for all costs which may be taxed against the plaintifff in '
such action, whether he obtained judgment or not. But
the plaintifff may deposit with the clerk of the court
such sum of money, as security for costs in the ease, as,
in the opinion of the clerk, will be sufficient for the
purpose ; and the clerk may, on motion of the defend
ant, and if satisfied that such deposit ia not sufficient,
require the same to be increased, or personal security to
be given. Provided, that the provisions of this section
shall not apply to re-enlisted veteran volunteers, who
are seeking to avail themselves of the provisions of
an act " to authorize and require the payment of bount
ies to veteran volunteers," passed April 16, 1867, and
amended April 16, 1880. [86 v. 353 ; 85 v. 306.]
Security for costs must be demanded before the case is called
for trial, T. 134. The want of security for costs can not be as
signed as error, 2 O. 259; T. 133. A surety may become such by
appearance and approval of court, 7 O. S. 309. His liability be
gins with the undertaking and ends with the termination of the
action, 9 Rec. 58; 5Bull501. The writ may be indorsed for costs
after return, so as to bind him, 18 O. 240. Under a previous
amendment the surety of a non-resident for costs was only liable
for such costs as the defendant might recover against the plaint
iff and for the costs of the plaintifff's witnesses, ISO. S. 178 (1864).
There is no mode of release provided by the statute, and without
consent of the defendant the surety can be saved from future
liability only by dismissal of the action, 9 Rec. 58; 5 Bull 501
Moving for new security is not a waiver of the right to object to
the discharge of the original surety unless such security is
given, Id.
§ 6341. When action may be dismissed for want of
security for oosts. If security for costs be not given in a
case mentioned in the preceding section, the court shall,
at any time before the commencement of the trial, on
motion of the defendant, and notice to the plaintifff, dis
miss the action, unless in a reasonable time, which may
be allowed by the court, security be given. [51 v. 57,
§544; S.&C. 1116.]
§ 6342. Security required, if plaintifff become non
resident. If the plaintifff become a non-resident of the
county in which the suit is brought, during its pendency,
he may be compelled, in the manner stated in the two preceding sections, to give such security. [51 v. 57,
§ 545; S.&C. 1116.]
§ 5343. When additional security may he required.
In an action in which security for costs has been given,
the defendant may, at any time before commencement of
the trial, after reasonable notice to the plaintifff, move
the court for additional security ; and if, on such motion,
the court is satisfied that the surety has removed from
this state, or is not sufficient, the action may be dis
missed, unless, in a reasonable time, to be fixed by the
court, sufficient security be given. [51 v. 57, \ 546 ;
S. & C. 1116.]
§ 5344. When judgment may be entered against surety
for oosts. After final judgment in an action in which
security for costs has been given, the court may, on mo
tion of the defendant, or a person having a right to such
costs, or any part thereof, after ten days' notice of such
motion, render judgment, in the name of the defendant,
or his legal representatives, against the surety for costs,
his executors or administrators, for the amount of costs
adj udged against the plaintifff, or so much thereof as is
unpaid; and execution may be issued on such judgment
as in other cases, for the use and benefit of the persons
entitled to such costs. [51 v. 57, § 547 ; S. & C. 1116.]
§5345. When informers shall pay costs. If an in
former, under a penal statute, to whom is given the
penalty, or any part thereof, if recovered, dismiss his
suit or prosecution, or fail in the same, he shall pay all
costs, unless he is an officer whose duty it is to commence
the same. [51 v. 57, \ 548 ; S. & C. 1117.]
This section refers only to civil actions, Yaple's Pr., etc. 591.
§ 5346. Costs, when defendant disclaims. When a
defendant disclaims having title or interest in land, or
other property, the subject of the action, he shall recover
costs, unless, for special reasons, the court adjudge oth
erwise. [51 v. 57, 1 549 ; S. & C. 1117.]
§ 5347. Costs on motions, amendments, etc Unless
otherwise provided by statute, the costs of motions, con
tinuances, amendments, and the like, shall be taxed and
paid as the court may direct. [51 v. 57, § 550 ; S. & C.
1117.]
§ 5348. When defendant shall pay costs. When it is
not otherwise provided by statute, costs shall be allowed, of course, to the plaintifff, upon a judgment in his favor,
in actions for the recovery of money only, or for the
recovery of specific real or personal property. [51 v. 57,
?551; S.&C. 1117.]
Where the defendant pleads a counterclaim, which is allowed,
and the plaintifff recovers one hundred dollars or more, he in
entitled to judgment for costs, 40 O. S. 106. 107. In an action to
recover the amount of a judgment theretofore rendered, the
plaintifff is entitled to recover interest upon the costs adjudged
to him from the date of the original judgment to the time of
recovery, 42 O. S. 83, 93. The costs which are carried into the
judgment of a party draw interest whether they have heen
paid by such party or not, Id. A court without jurisdiction
has no power to render judgment for costs, 42 O. S. 249 ; but a
court reversing a judgment for the reason that the court below
had no jurisdiction must render judgment for costs on error,
42 O. S. 312, citing 22 O. S. 268; see, generally, 3 O. 380, 381 ; 5 O.
45, 47.
§ 5349. When plaintifff shall not recover costs. If it
shall appear that a justice of the peace has jurisdiction
of an action, and the same has been brought in any
other court, and the judgment is less than one hundred
dollars (1), unless the recovery be reduced below that
sum by counterclaim or set-off (2), each- party shall
pay his own costs ; and in all actions for libel, slander,
malicious prosecution, assault, assault and battery, false
imprisonment, criminal conversation, or seduction, ac
tions for nuisance, or against a justice of the peace for
misconduct in office, when the damage assessed is under
five dollars, the plaintifff shall not recover costs (3).
[83 v. 86 ; 51 v. 57, \ 552 ; S. & C. 1 1 17.]
1. 14 O.S. 336 (1863). The amount claimed in the petition deter
mines the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas, ii O. S. 598;
out
can be no judgment
on appeal
if the justice
had there
no jurisdiction,
15 O. S. 483.for costs
It is error
to instruct
a jury
that in a proper case for exemplary damages they should know
that in case the party recovers less than one hundred dollars he
can not recover his costs in the action, 11 O. S. 457. 2. 6 O. S. 598
H856). And if plaintifff recovers one hundred dollars or more, after
the allowance of a counterclaim, he. of course, recovers costs,
40 O. S. 106, 107 ; but in an action brought in the common pleas
for the recovery of money only, where the facts alleged in a
counterclaim set up by the defendant are denied by the plaint
iff, and the jury by a geueral verdict find " the issues joined"
for the plaintifff, and asse>s his damages at less than one hundred
dollars, the plaintifff is not entitled to recover costs, 23 O. S. 196;
see 8 Rec. 415. 3. Assault and battery, 3 O. 380; slander, W. 36.
§ 5350, When plaintifff to pay oosts. Costs shall be
allowed, of course, to any defendant, upon a judgment in his favor in the actions mentioned in the two pre
ceding sections. [51 v. 57, \ 553 ; S. & C. 1117.]
In a suit against a trustee in relation to the trust estate,
demanding what he might hesitate to grant, except under the
protection of tlio court, the plaintifff will be charged with the
costs, 12 O. 287, 29B.
§ 5351. When costs awarded in the discretion of the
court. In other actions the court may award and tax
costs, and apportion them between the parties, on the
same or adverse sides, as it may adjudge to be right and
equitable. [51 v. 57, §554; S. & C. 1118.]
In proceedings to redeem mortgaged property, 18 O. S. 184 : in
action for partnership account, 1 C. S. 0. R. 166 ; on exceptions to
administrator's account. 16 0. S. 273; where judgment on warrant
of attorney is set aside under § 5354, 34 O. S. 142, 150. In a suit by
directors to dissolve an insolvent corporation where there was
no property, the court in its discretion could award costs against
the directors, 29 O. S. 438 ; see 21 Bull 238, 239.
'i 5352. When several actions are brought on the same
instrument. When several actions are brought on one
instrument in writing, against several parties who might
have been joined at defendants in the same action, no
costs shall be recovered by the plaintifff in more than one
of the actions, if the parties proceeded against in the
other actions were, at the commencement of the previous
action, openly within the state. [51 v. 57, ? 555 ; S. & C.
1118.]
1 H. 286.
§ 5353. Fees on summons to another county. When
a summons is issued to another county, it may be re
turned by mail, and the sheriff shall be entitled to the
same fees as if it had issued in the county of which he
is sheriff. [51 v. 57, \ 556 ; S. & C. 1118.]
CHAPTEK VI.
NEW TRIAL, AND OTHER RELIEF AFTER JUDGMENT.
§ 5354. When court may vacate or modify judgment
or order after the term. The common pleas court, or the
circuit court, may vacate or modify its own judgment or
order, after the term at which the same was made :
1. By granting a new trial for the cause within the
time and in the manner provided in § 5309.
2. By a new trial granted in proceedings against defendants constructively summoned, as provided in \ 5048.
3. For mistake, neglect, or omission of the clerk, or
irregularity in obtaining a judgment or order.
4. For fraud practiced by the successful party in
obtaining a judgment or order.
5. For erroneous proceedings against an infant, or
person of unsound mind, when the condition of such
defendant does not appear in the record, nor the error in
the proceedings.
6. For the death of one of the parties before the
judgment in the action.
7. For unavoidable casualty or misfortune, prevent
ing the party from prosecuting or defending.
8. For errors in a judgment, shown by an infant
within twelve months after arriving at full age, as pre
scribed in \ 5330.
9. For taking judgments upon warrants of attorney
for more than was due the plaintifff, when the defendant
was not summoned, or otherwise legally notified of the
time and place of taking such judgment.
10. When such judgment or order was obtained, in
whole or in a material part, by false testimony on the
part of the successful party, or any witness in his behalf,
which ordinary prudence could not have anticipated or
guarded against, and the guilty party has been con
victed. [82 v. 34 ; 77 v. 46 ; 74 v. 1 15, \ 534.]
After the existence of one or more of the causes enumerated in
this section has been found, an issue or issues as to the validity of
the alleged defense should be made up by proper pleadings and
tried as in other cases, 25 O. S. 340. When the alleged defense is
thus adjudged to be valid, and not before, the court is authorized
to make a final order of vacation or modification of the original
judgment, Id. When the judgment sought to be vacated is
taken jointly against all the defendants, and the defense set
forth in the petition is joint, going to the whole cause of action,
the judgment, if erroneous as to some of the defendants, is
erroneous as to all, and if the defense is established should be
vacated as to all, 24 O. S. 625. The provisions of this chapter
apply to special proceedings, 6 O. S. 221. A judgment under
this section is not appealable. It can only be reviewed on
petition in error, 12 O. S. 169: but where a petition impeaching
a decree for fraud seeks relief, which could not be obtained by
a retrial of the case in which the judgment or decree was ren
dered, it will be regarded as a civil action, and not a proceeding
under this section ; and an appeal may be taken in such action
as in other cases, 23 O. S. 415 ; generally, 3 C. C. R. 144. power to direct the clerk to correct not only clerical errors, but
such errors as may arise from any fraudulent or improper alter
ation or mutilation of its files or records, 8 O. S. 201. To make
such correction, the court may hear evidence and act on the
proof, and it is not essential to the action of the court that the
judges act on their personal knowledge of the error, Id. A cler
ical error in the entry of a judgment maybe corrected on motion
at a subsequent term, 3 O. S. 50S; and the court may, on motion
made at a subsequent term, modify the entry of a verdict and
judgment, ko as to show that the judgment was in fact rendered
on June 10th, though not recorded until the 19th, 18 O. S. 419. An
omission to enter upon the journal notice of an appeal, it has
been held, could not be cured by a nun-: pro tunc order at a subse
quent term, although when it was given notice of the appeal
had been entered by the court upon its docket, 10 O. 198; but
" so rigid a rule of construction would not seem to be applicable
to laws remedial in their nature," 1 O. S. 175. And where a
motion to confirm a sheriff's sale was granted and the sale con
firmed, but by mistake the judge noted on the court docket that
the motion was refused, and this note misled the clerk, and
induced him to make a like entry on the journal of the court, it
was held that this was a mistake of the clerk as well as the judge,
which might, under this subdivision, be corrected, 43 O. S. 198.
Parol evidence is admissible to show that a judgment was
entered by mistake, 34 O. S. 672. Where the judgment entered
on the journal is different from what was intended by the court,
but is shown to be such as ought to have been rendered, it
will not be vacated or modified as entered by mistake. Id.
An interlocutory decree could be modified, altered, or set aside
on motion at any time before final decree, 13 O. 408. An order
nunc pro tunc could not be entered at a subsequent term, unless
an order was actuallv made at a preceding term and omitted
to be entered, 1 O. 375; 3 O. 486, 553; 6 O. 33. Where an order
nunc pro tunc was entered at the July term, to take effect at the
April term preceding, an appeal bond filed within thirty days
after the July term was not in time, 10 O. 202.
Irregularity in obtaining judgment or order. It is competent
for the court, on motion and proof by affidavit, to order an entry
of satisfaction of a judgment wrongfully made to be set aside
and vacated and award execution on thejudgment, 14 O. S. 464.
A judgment may be set aside on motion at a subsequent term
for irregularity or improper conduct in procuring it to be
entered, 3 O. S. 445; 3 O. 15; and although the court, in the
exercise of such power, may act erroneously, such error will
not render the proceeding void so that the record can be col
laterally impeached, 20 O. 344. In a proceeding of this kind, the
court exercises an equitable jurisdiction, and should not vacate
a judgment or order against the right and justice of the case,
3 O. S. 445. When no process is served on defendant and an
attorney enters an appearance for him without authority, judg
ment against him may, on motion, be set aside at a subsequent
term, 3 O. 519 ; see 19 O. 286. When judgment is taken on a war
rant of attorney without tiling the original warrant or a copy
thereof, this is an irregularity for which the judgment maybe
set aside at the same or a subsequent term, the motion having
been filed at the first term and regularly continued, 9 O. S. 506.
And if such motion was made at the term when judgment was entered by one or more of several debtors, and continued to a
subsequent term, it may be so amended at such subsequent
term as to permit the other debtor or debtors to join in it, Id.
To render judgment by default before the expiration of the day
named in the summons for answer, is not merely an irregularity
to be only corrected by motion in the court of original jurisdic
tion, but an error for which the judgment may he reversed, 34
O. S. 123, 126. Rule of court providing lor notice in case of par
tial or interlocutory decree—no notice necessary in case of final
decree, see 12 Bull 20, 23. The right to vacate is not waived by
voluntary payment of the amount which the debtor admits to
be due, 1 W. L. M. 581. And a payment made after the issuance
of an execution to prevent a levy upon or a sale of the property
of the defendant in execution is not such a voluntary paymeut
as will preclude the party from setting aside the judgment for
irregularity, 9 O. S. 506 ; see § 5310 n.
4. For fraud practiced by successful porty. The special proceed
ing provided by this section is a cumulative remedy, and does
not exclude or limit the right of a party by original action to
impeach a judgment or enjoin its collection for fraud practiced
by tne successful party, 41 O. S. 514; 23 O. S. 415. A petition set
ting forth the issue in the action, and alleging that defendants
entered into a conspiracy to, and did, testify falsely and thereby
obtained the judgment, evidence to sustain such allegations
having been discovered since the trial, is sufficient under this
subdivision, 39 O. S. 624. Where a petition to vacate avers that
the judgment sought to be vacated was procured to be entered
on default for answer without evidence, for a demand not
founded on contract, express or implied, and its averments are
admitted by demurrer, it discloses fraud in the prevailing party
constituting a ground for vacation, 2 C. C. R. 143; but where
the alleged fraud consisted in the fact that a bond in suit was in
German, but the petition counted upon it as in Knglish, and de
fendant, relying upon the statement in the petition that a party
named on the bond was a surety, pleaded to that state of the
case, whereas, in fact, the party"was only a witness, this was
held not sufficient to authorize the court to set the judgment
aside for fraud practiced by the successful party, 5 Bull 353, 354.
5. Erroneous proceedings against infant. The provisions of this
subdivision do not apply when the fact of infancy appears in
the record of the judgment, 45 O. S. 93; 17 Bull 230, 231. A married
woman does not come within the protection of this subdivis
ion, 6 Neb. 187. She did before the amendment of 82 v. 34;
see 77 v. 46.
6. For the death of one of tfie parties before judgment. A judg
ment rendered against a party after his death may be vacated
under this section on motion of his administrator, 28 O. S. 472. If
a case has been tried and submitted to the court during the
lives of the parties and one die before judgment is rendered,
such judgment, when rendered, may be entered nunc pro tunc
as of the trial term ; see 6 O. S. 228 ; 14 Bull 52 s. c. 1 C. C. R. 59,
61; and where the representative of a deceased party defendant
appears, or is made a party afterward, and submits himself to
the jurisdiction of the court, the proceeding being simply ancil
lary to the original action, and in effect a continuation of it,
such party is bound by any action the court may properly take
in such proceeding relating to the proceedings or merits of the
action, 14 Bull 52 ; 1 C. C. R. 59, 62.
7. Unavoidabte casuaity or misfortune. Absence from the state
at the time of service of summons by leaving copy at residence,
and ignorance of the pendency of the action, not unavoidable
casualty or misfortune, 1 W. L. M. 278; nor ignorance of the
time fixed by law for holding term of court, 2 Neb. 143 ; nor in
correct information received by attorney through messenger
that there would be no court, 2 Bull 1 13 ; nor entering j udgment
in violation of agreement with opposing counsel, 4 Bull 289.
(The petition did not allege what the defense was, nor what the
errors were. Id. 291.) Illness of a party to the suit preventing
his attendance at the trial is ground for setting judgment aside,
32 Kas. 319 ; but not the illness of a party's agent, 12 Bull 20, 22,
nor the neglect of his counsel, 1 Clev. R. 18 ; see 1 Clev. R. 196 ; 2
Id. 204 ; but a proceeding to vacate a judgment of dismissal for
want of prosecution, stating that plaintifff had died, and the ad
ministrator was not aware of the existence of the action at the
time it was dismissed, and plaintifff's attorney did not attend to
it because his authority had. ceased on plaintifff's death, and be
cause he supposed the administrator would attend to it, states a
good ground for vacating judgment, 1 Clev. R. 178.
8. Errors injudgment shown by infant. Where, in a proceeding
In error to which an infant is a party defendant, the supreme
court reverses a judgment that had been rendered in his favor,
and remands the cause to the court in which it had been ren
dered, with direction to render a judgment against thy infantin
accordance with its rulings, which is done, the judgment so ren
dered is the judgment of the court to which the cause had been
remanded for judgment; and where the infant, on arriving at
full age, would avail himself of the right secured to him by this
subdivision, he must commence the proceeding in the court be
low, where the judgment was in fact rendered; it can not be
commenced, in the first instance, in the supreme court. 45 O. S. 93;
17 Buff 230. A married woman does not come within the pro
visions of this subdivision, Id. 231.
9. For taking judgment upon warrants of attorney, etc. Where,
under this subdivision, judgment was taken for more than was
due and plaintifff remitted the excess by leave of the court, it was
held the proceeding could properly be dismissed without va
cating the judgment, 10 O. S. 133. Where plaintifff took judg
ment on warrant of attorney against the principal debtor and
his sureties for an excessive amount, and the principal debtor
brought suit against the judgment-plaintifff under this chapter
within the limited period 53(i.i), but did not make the sureties
parties to the proceedings until after the limited time had
elapsed, after each of the judgment-defendants had notice of
the judgment, the court had jurisdiction of the proceedings, and
it was held to be error to dismiss the same on that ground, on
motion of the judgment-plaintifff, 40 O. S. 70. Where judgment
on warrant of attorney is opened by proceedings under this sec
tion, and, on issue joined, the amount of the judgment is re
duced, and the plaintifff takes a second trial, which results in a
finding in his favor of the same amount as on the former trial,
it is not error to render judgment against him for the costs of
the latter trial, ::4 (,. S.
see \ 5324 n. ; 7 O. iFt. 2) 175.
10. 39 O. S. 024 is governed by subdivision 4. Limitation.se©
§ 5363.
§ 5355. When judgment on service by publication, may
 e opened. A party against whom a judgment or order
has been rendered, without other service than by publi
cation in a newspaper, may, at any time within five
years after the date of the judgment or order, have the
same opened, and be let in to defend ; but before the
judgment or order can be opened, the applicant shall
give notice to the adverse party of his intention to make
the application, and shall file a full answer to the peti
tion, pay all costs, if the court require them to be paid,
and make it appear to the satisfaction of the court that
during the pendency of the action he had no actual no
tice thereof in time to appear in court and make his
defense; and each party may present affidavits. [51 v.
57, I 75 ; 56 v. 93, ? 3 ; S. & C. 965, 1172.]
The notice required to be given to the adverse party under this
section must be given to such party to the case as may be inter
ested in maintaining the judgment, 30 O. S. 444. A. decree ob
tained on publication of notice may be vacated without a trial
upon the merits, 4 W. L. M. 581. This section can not apply to
a case of service of a copy of the petition and summons on the
defendant out of the state, Yaple's Pr., etc., 607, as that gives him
actual notice of the pendency of the action in time to appear and
defend ; and if he has had such notice, he can not open the judg
ment, Id.
i> 5356. Bona fide purchaser unaffected. The title to
any property which is the subject of the judgment or
order sought to be opened, and which, by or in conse
quence of the judgment or order, has passed to a pur
chaser in good faith, shall not be affected by any
proceedings under the two preceding sections ; nor shall
the title to any property sold before judgment under an
attachment be affected by said sections. [51 v. 57, \ 75 ;
S. & C. 965.]
See 35 O. S. 555 ; 2 C. C. R. 77, 81.
§ 5357. Proceedings to oorreot mistakes of clerk, etc
The proceedings to correct mistakes or omissions of the
clerk, or irregularity in obtaining a judgment or order,
shall be by motion, upon reasonable notice to the adverse
party, or his attorney, in the action (1); but the motion to
vacate a judgment because of its rendition before the
action regularly stood for trial, can be made only in the
first three days of the succeeding term. [51 v. 57, \ 535;
S. & C. 1114.]
1. See notes, subdivision 3, § 5354. Notice must be given, 12
O. S. 136; 20 O. 344, and will not be presumed, 12 O. S. 136: but
see 20 O. 344. When the adverse party appears and defends, the
notice is waived, 43 O. S. 198.
§ 5358. When petition and affidavit must be filed.
The proceedings to vacate the judgment or order on the
grounds mentioned in subdivisions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10,
of § 5354, shall be by petition, verified by affidavit, seting forth the judgment or order, the grounds to vacate or
modify it, and, if the party applying was defendant, the
defense to the action ; and on such petition a summons
shall issue and be served as in the commencement of an
action. [74 v. 115, I 536.]
A party, by making application to vacate or modify a judg
ment, under \ 5357 or this section, voluntarily submits himself to
the jurisdiction of the court, and is bound by any judgment or
order which may bo afterward rendered in the action, 25 O. S.
340. Summons can not be served on attorney of record in such
judgment, 3 W. L. M. 195. Demurrer or answer to such petition
unnecessary, Id. Non-resident may be made defendant in such
petition, by constructive service. Affidavit for publication and
published notice must identify judgment to be vacated, Id.
§ 5359. Grounds to vacate to be first tried. The court
must first try and decide upon the grounds to vacate or
modify a judgment or order, before trying or deciding
upon the validity of the defense or cause of action. [51
v. 57, I 537; S. & C. 1115.]
§ 5360. Conditions on which judgment maybe vacated
or modified. A judgment shall not be vacated on motion
or petition until it is adjudged that there is a valid de
fense to the action in which the judgment was rendered;
or, if the plaintifff seeks its vacation, that there is a valid
cause of action; and when a judgment is modified, all
liens and securities obtained under it shall be preserved
to the modified judgment. [51 v. 57, \ 538 ; S. & C. 1115.]
There must be a valid defense to the action, 1 W. L. M. 278, 282.
A finding on the merits on the final trial in favor of the party
againstwhom the irregularity was committed is a sufficient com
pliance with this section, 25 O. S. 652. The section does not apply
to cases where there is confessedly no such cause of action, or
where the court had no jurisdiction over the person of the de
fendant, 9 O. S. 506, 510. It was not intended to deprive the
parties of their right to a jury trial under 5359, 5360 ; and it is
error in the court after deciding that there is a good ground to
vacate to proceed to " try and decide " upon the validity of the
defense in a case where the parties have a right to a trial by jury
and do not waive that right, 24 O. S. 625 ; 25 O. S. 340.
§ 5361. When enforcement of j udgment may be enj oined.
The party seeking to vacate or modify a judgment or
order may obtain an injunction suspending proceedings
on the whole or a part thereof, which injunction may be
granted by the court, or any judge thereof, when it is
rendered probable, by affidavit, or by exhibition of the
record, that the party is entitled to have such judg
ment or order vacated or modified. [51 v. 5", \ 539;
S. & C. 1115.]
§ 5362. Suspension of execution, when judgment pre
maturely rendered. If the judgment was rendered before
the action stood for trial, the suspension may be granted
as provided in the preceding section, although no valid
defense to the action be shown ; and the court shall make
such orders concerning the executions to be issued on the
judgment shall give to the defendant the same rights
of delay he would have had if the judgment had been
rendered at the proper time. [51 v. 57, \ 540 ; S. & C. 1115.]
A judgment rendered by default before the expiration of the
day named in the summons for answer may bo reversed on error,
34 O. S. 123.
§ 5363. Limitations. Proceedings to vacate or modify
a judgment or order, for the causes mentioned in subdi
visions 4, 5, and 7, of \ 5354, must be commenced within
two years after the judgment was rendered or order
made; proceedings for the causes mentioned in subdi
visions 3 and 6 of the same section shall be commenced
within three years, and in subdivision 9 within two
years, after the defendant has notice of the judgment;
and under subdivision 10 of the same section the pro
ceedings may be commenced after the guilty party is
convicted, if the conviction be within two years from
the rendition of the judgment; but persons within the
age of minority, of unsound mind, or imprisoned, may
commence such proceeding within the respective times
limited by this section after such disability is removed.
[83 v. 74; 74 v. 115, §541.]
Subdivision 3. § 5354. Limitation, 34 O. 8. 204. Subdivision
9, I 5354 ; see 40 O. S. 70.
§ 5364. When full amount is not sued for and recov
ered. When, by mistake of the pleader, the amount
claimed in the pleading, and recovered, is less than the
true amount then due, the party injured by the mistake may recover the balance by civil action, without costs.
[66 v. 144, § 1.]
§ 5365. Provisions of this chapter apply to supreme
and probate courts. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to the supreme court and probate court, so far as
the same may be applicable to their judgments or final
orders; and in estimating time the probate court shall,
for this purpose, be considered as holding, in each year,
three terms, of four months each, the first commencing
on the first of January of each vear. [51 v. 57, § 542;
S. &C. 1115.]
Judgments of the supreme court commission can be modified
by the supreme court, 34 O. S. 072. Parties have not a right to a
rehearing after the decision of a cause by the supreme court
unless the application comes within the provisions of this sec
tion. Nor can such rehearing be ordered by the court after the
term at which the judgment was entered if the case is not
within those provisions, 26 O. S. 378. The provisions of $ 5354,
as extended by this section, do not confer power upon a probate
court in proceedings instituted under § 5358 to vacate or modify
its own orders previously made in The settlement of the accounts
of executors and administrators, 26 O. .S. 357.
CHAPTER VII.
REVIVOR OF, AND NEW PARTIES TO, JUDGMENT.
§ 5366. How parties not served made parties to judg
ments in case of joint contracts. When judgment is ren
dered in this state on a joint contract or instrument,
parties to the action who were not summoned, and per
sons whose liability was not known to the plaintifff at
the rendition of the judgment, may be made parties
thereto by action in the same court, if they can be sum
moned in the state; or, when the judgment is rendered
elsewhere, the plaintifff may bring suit upon such con
tract or instrument against the parties not summoned, or
persons whose liability was unknown, in any county
where any such parties reside or mav be summoned.
[48 v. 31, § 1 ; 56 v. 39, § 415 ; S. & C. 1060, 1 149.]
In an action under this section to make a joint maker not
served party to a judgment, it is no defense to show that the
original action was brought before the maturity of the note, 42
O. S. 11 ; but where it was sought to make one a party to a judg
ment who was originally named as a party but not served, it
was held a good defense to show that no judgment could have
been rendered against him if originally served, 19 O. 372.
" Upon the peculiar facts of that case 119 O. 372] we have no disposition to question the entire soundness of the conclusion
reached. No joint liability was ever incurred upon the note in
suit, and so, in legal effect, the court found, although one of the
defendants was in default," 42 O. S. 13.
§ 5367. Revivor of dormant judgment. When a judg
ment, including judgments rendered by a justice of the
peace or mayor, a transcript of which has been filed in
the court of common pleas for execution, becomes dor
mant, it may be revived in the same manner as pre
scribed for reviving actions before judgment, or by
action; when either party to such dormant judgment,
his agent or attorney, makes affidavit showing that the
adverse party is a non-resident of the state, and that
such judgment remains unsatisfied, in whole or in part,
and the amount owing thereon, service may be made by
publication as in other cases; if sufficient cause be not
shown to the contrary, the judgment shall stand revived
for the amount which the court finds to be due and un
satisfied thereon ; and the lien of the judgment for the
amount due shall be revived, and shall operate from the
time of the entry of the conditional order, or the filing
of the petition. [57 v. 4, § 490 ; 62 v. 40, § 1 ; 64 v. 236,
§417 ; S. & C. 1093 ; S. & S. 421, 562.]
See § 5380. Revivor of judgment of justice of thepeace, § 6681.
Where a judgment is revived, it is revived with all its incidents
as between the parties, 5 O.178; but the title of a purchaser
from the judgment debtor is, on the judgment becoming dor
mant, discharged from the lien, and the subsequent revivor of
the judgment will not affect the title, Id.; 10 O. 103; l.", O. 8OI;
25 O. S. 358. If a judgment is obtained on unsealed process,
and such judgment bo afterwards revived without objection,
the want of a seal dces not impair the validity of the judgment,
15 O. 735.
§ 5368. Id. Limitation. An action to revive a judg
ment can only be brought within twenty-one years from
the time it became dormant, unless the party enti
tled to bring such action was, at the time the judgment
became dormant, within the age o£ minority, of unsound
mind, or imprisoned, in which cases the action may be
brought within fifteen years after such disability is re
moved. [83 v. 74 ; 73 v. 148, \ 1.]
See I 4978n.
§ 5369. Revivor when party dies after judgment. If
either or both of the parties die after j udgment rendered,
and before satisfaction thereof, their representatives, real or personal, or both, as the case may require, may
be made parties to the judgment, and the same may be
revived by an action brought for that purpose ; or they
may be made parties thereto in the same manner as is
prescribed for the revival of actions before judgment;
and such judgment may be rendered and execution
awarded as might or should have been given or awarded
against the representatives, real or personal, or both, of
such deceased party; and where any judgment or decree
has been rendered in the circuit court of any county,
and a mandate has been directed to the common pleas
court to carry the same into execution, and if either or
both parties thereto die before satisfaction thereof, the
same may be revived in such common pleas court in
conformity with this section. [82 v. 34; 77 v. 201; 51
v. 57, § 416 ; S. & C. 1060.]
See 1 C. C. R. 32 ; 35 O. S. 430. A judgment in personam, under
which no specific lien on real estate was acquired during the life
time of the judgment debtor, can not be revived and enforced
against the heirs, 29 O. S. 257.
§ 5370. Partners may be made parties to judgment
against firm. The members of a partnership, against
which a judgment has been rendered by its firm name,
may be made parties to the judgment by action. [44 v.
66, H; S.&C. 1139.]
This section applies only to unincorporated companies.
Neither corporations de jure nor de facto are within its provis
ions. And an action can not be maintained under this section
to charge the stockholders with the payment of a judgment
against the corporation, 38 O. S. 269.
§ 5371. Sureties on bond of executor, etc., parties to
judgment. Sureties to the bond of an executor, admin
istrator, guardian, or trustee, may be made parties to a
judgment thereon against the principal, by action.
[51 v. 397, § 2 ; S. & C. 1139.]
§ 5372. Execution, how issued and directed. An exe
cution is a process of the court, issued by the clerk, and
directed to the sheriff of the county ; and executions
may be issued to the sheriffs of different counties at the
same time. [51 v. 57, § 418 ; S. & C. 1062.]
In Ohio sales of real estate under decrees either final or inter
locutory are to be conducted as upon execution at law. Orders
of sale issued on such decrees are executions under 5372 and
5373, 2 C. C. R. 330 ; see 19 Bull 221, § 5373.
§ 5373. Kinds of executions. Executions are of three
kinds :
1. Against the property of the judgment debtor, in
cluding orders of sale.
2. Against the person of the judgment debtor.
3. For the delivery of the possession of real property ;
in which case the writ shall contain a specific description
of the property, and a command to the sheriff to deliver
the property to the person entitled thereto ; and the writ
may also require him to make the damages recovered for
withholding the possession, and costs, or costs alone, out
of the property of the person who so withholds the pos
session. [51 v. 57, \1 419, 487 ; S. & C. 1062, 1093.]
SUBDIVISION II. EXECUTION AGAINST PROPERTY.
§ 5374. Property subject to levy and sale. Lands and
tenements, including vested interests therein (1), and
permanent leasehold estates renewable forever (2), and
goods and chattels (3), not exempt by law, shall be sub
ject to the payment of debts, and shall be liable to be
taken on execution and sold as hereinafter provided.
[37 v. 44, § 1; 51 v. 57, ? 420; S.& C. 1063, 1142.]
1. Curtesy of husband, 12 O. 79; 5 Bull 26 ; 1 Id. 173; devised
property, the will exempting it from debt, 15 O. S. 419; equity of
redemption, 10 O. 71; fraudulently couveyed land, 10 O. 162; 40
O. S. 107; possessory rights, 10 O. 403; 40 O. S. 635: vested re
mainder held under legal title, 31 O. S. 175; but equitable estates are not, 5 O. S. 253 ; 40 O. S. 117: nor trust estates, 1 O. 257; 16
O. 469 ; nor public property not held for private purposes, see 5
Bull 684 ; 4 Bull 75 : nor property in the custody of a receiver,
without leave of court, JO O. S. 372, 404 ; 20 O. S. 137. 2. Perpet
ual leasehold, 13 O. 334; 11 O. 355. Leasehold property, see 4
Bull 961; 1 Id. 173. 3. Equity of redemption in chattel mort
gage, 14 O. S. 457 ; 20 O. S. 38; exempt property until selected,
38 O. S. 416 ; growing crops, 11 O. 364 ; partnership goods, 16 O.
142 ; 18 O. 181 ; 12 O. S. 647 ; but unissued bank bills are not, W.
455; nor unissued bonds of a railroad company, 2 D. 465; nor
property in the hands of a bailee, 16 O. 431 ; nor pledged prop
erty, 2 C. S. C. R. 299.
§ 5373. When lien of judgment attaches to lands or
goods. Such lands and tenements, within the county
where the judgment is entered, shall be bound for the
satisfaction thereof from the first day of the term at
which judgment is rendered ( 1 ) ; but judgments by con
fession (2), and judgments rendered at the same term at
which the action is commenced, shall bind such lands
only from the day on which such judgments are ren
dered ; and all other lands, as well as goods and chattels
of the debtor, shall be bound from the time they are
seized in execution (3). [37 v. 44, ? 1 ; 51 v. 57, 1 421;
S. & C. 1064, 1142.]
1. 17 O. S. 231 ; see 16 O. Ill, 534. Held, that lien dated from
10 A. M., by rule of court fixed under 55 v. 83, though court met
later, 17 O. S. 231. 2. Formerly they were a lien from the first
day of the term, 14 O. 514 (act 1831), and see 3 O. 65. Judgments
confessed during term, postponed to judgments in pending ac
tions, rendered at same term, 5 O. 48. 3. But where the officer
indorsed a paper levy, and allowed the debtor to retain control
of the property with power of use and sale in the usual course
of business, the levy was held void and the goods and chattels
subject to seizure on execution in favor of other creditors. 33
O. S. 85. When a valid levy has been made upon goods and chat
tels in the hands of the officer, a constructive levy of subsequent
executions coming into his hands before sale maybe made by
indorsement merely; but when the original levy is a mere pa
per levy, and thereforee void, a constructive levy of actual execu
tions will not bind the property against subsequent executions
actually levied thereon, Id.; see 40 O. S. 335. No entry by the
sheriff upon real estate is necessary to constitute a valid levy
thereon, 38 O. B. 610. The levy of a foreign execution is com
plete when indorsed on the execution and before entry thereof,
as required by g 1212, Id.
Extent of and property subject to judgment liens. Judgment liens
exist only by statutory creation, 33 O. S. 379; 2 O. S. 36; 24 O. S.
379. To operate as such the judgment must be final, 8 O. 136 ; 33
O. S. 370. They are not vacated by appeal , 15 O. S. 310 ; see 'i 5376 ;
nor affected by a second trial, 37 O. S. 392; nor by the organiza
tion of a new county including the incumbered land, 11 O. 98.
A judgment lien is co-extensive with the jurisdiction of the court. 24 O. S. 379; 31 O. S. 175; of the Superior Court of Cincin
nati with the county, 24 O. S. 379; of the United States courts
with the state or district, 5 O. 398 ; 2 O. S. 37: see 31 O. S. 175:
though the judgment may have been rendered in one of the ju
dicial districts into which the state is divided and the property
1ies in another, 11 Bull 254, citing 6 Paige, ch. 465 ; 5 Rep. 616 ; 10
Chicago L. N. 228, 328; 6 C. L. j. 261; see 20 Bull 246. The
lien operates only on legal titles, 6 O. 156 ; 3 O. 514 ; 1 O. 318. An
equity of redemption is subject to the lien, 2 O. 224 ; 15 O. S. 310;
and land fraudulently conveyed, 10 O. 162; 8 O. 529; perpetual
leases, 13 O. 334 (but not when conveyed prior to judgment, as
security, 11 O. 355. An estate for years created by lieu granting
privilege of purchase subject to lien only from time of levy and
seizure. 2 D. 544); an easement, 20 O. 401; a homestead, 42 O. S.
139 ; a vested remainder, 31 O. S. 175 ; but after-acquired property
is not, 4 O. 92 ; nor equitable interests. 8 O. 21 ; 1O. 318 ; nor hus
band's land for alimony, unless so ordered. 10 O. 268; nor land
purchased before deed or possession, 40 O. S. 117; nor trust
estates, 11 O. S. 84; 20 O. S. 68; nor land of landlord of liquor
dealer without suit, 23 O. S. 619; nor assignor's land after assign
ment for creditors, 14 O. S. 200; nor land contracted to be sold,
except to the extent of the unpaid purchase money, 20 O. S. 68.
A balance due on foreclosure of a mortgage does not operate as
a lien, 16 O. 449; nor a recognizance, until judgment, 5 O. 480;
nor a judgment against a tenant in partition after order of sale,
22 O. S. 615 ; 8 Id. 646 ; nor a justice's judgment, 1 O. 318, unless
a transcript is filed, 31 O. S. 273; and a lien does not attach to
land and water-power leased of the state, 19 O. 399.
§ 5376. lien of judgment of supreme court. A judg
ment of the supreme court, for money, shall bind the
lands and tenements of the debtor, within the county in
which the suit originated, from the first day of the term
at which the judgment is entered, and all other lands,
and the goods and chattels, of the debtor, from the time
they are seized in execution ; but the lien of a judgment
of the common pleas court, in an action which is ap
pealed by the judgment debtor to the circuit court, and
is thence removed into the supreme court, shall not be
thereby divested or vacated, but shall continue till the
final determination of the action in the supreme court.
[82 v. 34; 51 v. 298, § 2 ; S. & C. 385.]
See §5236; 15 O. S.310.
§ 5377. Transoripts of judgments of justices and mayors
may be filed in common pleas court. The party in whose
favor a judgment is rendered by a justice of the peace,
or mayor of a municipal corporation, may, at any time
after judgment is rendered, if the same be not appealed
or stayed, file in the office of the clerk of the court
of common pleas of the county in which the ju;lgment was rendered a transcript thereof, having certi
fied therein the amount, if any, paid thereon ; and
thereupon the clerk shall enter the case on the execution
docket, together with the amount of the judgment, and
the time of filing the transcript ; hut if, within ten days
after the rendition of the judgment, the judgment
debtor pay the same, or give bail for stay of execution,
the justice or mayor shall forthwith certify that fact to
the clerk of the court of common pleas, who shall enter
a memorandum thereof upon the execution docket; and
the cost of the transcript, the filing thereof, and of the
entry on the docket, shall be paid by the party who files
the transcript, and taxed as increased costs, unless the
judgment debtor pay the same, give bail for stay of
execution, or appeals from the judgment rendered,
within ten days after the rendition of the judgment.
[85 v. 143.]
§ 5378. When such lien attaches. Such judgment, if
the transcript be filed in term time, shall be a lien on
the real estate of the judgment debtor within the county
from the day the transcript is filed (1); and if filed in
vacation, the judgment shall, as against the debtor, be a
lien from the day it is filed, but as against other transcripts
filed in vacation, and judgments rendered at the next
term of the court, it shall be a lien only from the first
day of the next term (2). [57 v. 4, ft 490 ; S. & C. 1093.]
1. Such lien does not become lost or removed from that part
of the real estate thereafter set off as a family homestead by the
assignment and use of such homestead, 42 O. S. 139. 2. Tran
scripts of judgments recovered before a justice of the peace were
filed with the clerk in vacation in pursuance of this section, and
the debtor afterward executed a mortgage, which was recorded
before the next term of the court. In an action to adjust the
liens between the mortgagee, the owners of the justice's judg
ments, and a creditor who obtained a judgment against the
debtor at the next term of the court, and for distribution of the
proceeds arising from the sale of the mortgaged premises, it was
held that the proceeds remaining after deducting the amount
due on the transcript judgments should be applied in satisfac
tion of the mortgage, and that any balance still remaining,
together with the amount so deducted, should be applied pro
rata in satisfaction of all the judgments, 31 O. S. 273, Mcllvaine
and Gilmore, JJ., dissenting. Mcllvaine, J., cited 2 O. S. 114 as
in point.
§ 5379. When execution may issue on such judgment.
Execution may be issued on such judgment at any time
after filing the transcript, as if the judgment had been rendered in court ; but the lien shall remain as provided
in the preceding section. [54 v. 21, § 491 ; S. & C. 1094.]
§ 5380. When judgment becomes dormant and ceases
to be a lien. If execution on a judgment rendered in
any court of record in this state, or a transcript of which
has been filed as provided in $ 5377, be not sued out
within five years from the date of the judgment, or if
five years intervene between the date of the last execu
tion issued on such judgment and the time of suing out
another execution thereon, such judgment shall become
dormant,' and shall cease to operate as a lien on the
estate of the judgment debtor. [51 v. 57, § 422; S. & C.
1067.]
See § 5367. The taking of an execution from the clerk's office by
the plaintifff, or his attorney, and returning the same without
delivering it to the sheriff, is not a suingout of execution within
the meaning of this section ; the writ must be actually or con
structively delivered to the sheriff, 8 O. S. 415. Proceedings in
error do not prevent the judgment from becoming dormant,
4 O. 459 ; but see § 5415. Where land is subject to two liens, the
elder a judgment and the other a mortgage, and the judg
ment becomes dormant, its priority is lost, and the mortgage
becomes the paramount lien, 10 O. 403. A senior judgment
creditor who has not issued execution for more than five years
is not entitled to money made by a sale of real estate under an
execution upon a junior judgment, 4 O. 459. Revivor of judg
ment revives the lien, 5 ii. 178, but does not a"ffect title of pur
chaser, 15 O. 301. This section does not apply to a decree for the
sale of specific property, 24 O. S. 415; 35 O. S. 480, but has sole
reference to judgments for money which are to be enforced by
execution, Id. Execution issued on a dormant judgment will
be set aside on motion, and the goods and money levied restored
to the judgment debtor, 4 O. 459 ; but query, whether a judicial
sale of real estate upon process upon a dormant judgment can
be impeached on that ground except by a petition in error to re
verse the order of continuation, 24 O. S. 445.
Dormancy during litigation. A judgment creditor who brings,
or who was properly made a party to, an action to subject mort
gaged land to sale, and to ascertain and marshal the liens
thereon, will not lose his right to share in the proceeds of a sale
because his judgment became dormant pending the action, 31
O. S. 175; 18 O. S. 376. The plaintifff in a preceding in foreclo
sure, having more than one valid lien on the premises, will be
protected only to the extent that he sets them up and asks relief;
and if he has a subsisting judgment lien at the time he com
mences his action, and fails to set the same up in his petition,
and such judgment, pending the proceedings, becomes dormant,
the plaintifff can not afterward set the same up by amendment
and have it enforced against the liens of other parties in the case,
31 O. y. 215. Where a judgment has become dormant during the
pendency of a provisional injunction against execution thereon,
the court will, on final dissolution of the injunction, order ex
ecution to issue for the balance equitably due, 17 O. S. 320; but
19 when the judgment debtor sold and conveyed the land to a pur
chaser without notice, who paid the purchase money, and the
judgment became dormant because of an injunction preventing
the issuing of an execution, the purchaser took the land dis
charged of the lien, 25 O. S. 355. Decree for alimony, 21 Jiull 277.
§ 6881. The command and indorsement of the writ of
execution. The writ of execution against the property
of the judgment debtor, issuing from any court of rec
ord, shall command the officer to whom it is directed
that of the goods and chattels of the debtor he cause to
be made the money specified in the writ, and, for want
of goods and chattels, shall cause the lands and tene
ments of said debtor to be sold for cash. But if the
court rendering the judgment or decree so orders, real
estate may be sold under writ of execution on the fol
lowing terms: One third cash on the day of sale, one
third in one year, one third in two years thereafter,
with interest on deferred payments, to be secured by
mortgage on the premises so sold. But an execution
issued on a judgment rendered against a partnership
firm, by its firm name, shall operate only on the part
nership property; and the exact amount of the debt,
damages, and costs for which the judgment is entered
shall be indorsed on the execution. [86 v. 372; 51 v.
57, \ 423.]
Partnership, see \\ 5011, 5042. Judgment lien of separate cred
itor postponed to equity of linn creditor whose claim accrued
during continuance of partnership, though subsequent to time
such lien attached, 43 O. S. 38. Sale under imperfect writ held
void, 9 O. S. 360. The exact amount of the debt, etc., shall be
indorsed on the execution, 25 O. S. 325.
§ 5382. In what oases no preference given to execu
tions. When two or more writs of execution against
the same debtor are sued out during the term in which
judgment was rendered, or within ten days thereafter,
and when two or more writs of execution against the
same debtor are delivered to the officer on the same day,
no preference shall be given to either of such writs ; but
if a sufficient sum of money be not made to satisfy all
executions, the amount made shall be distributed to the
several creditors in proportion to the amount of their
respective demands; in all other cases the writ of exe
cution first delivered to the officer shall be first satisfied ;
and the officer shall indorse on every writ of execution
the time when he received the same ; but nothing herein
contained shall be so construed as to affect any prefer
able lien which a judgment on which execution issued
§ 424 ; S. & C. 1069.]
This section applies only to executions from the same court,
2 H. 159, and to liens which are equal, and not to cases where,
.upon other principles, one party has a preferable lien, 2 O. 395;
3 O. 366; 13 O. 334. The clause "in all other cases the writ of
execution first delivered," etc., relates to executions in the
hands of the officer nt the time of the sale, and not to writs re
turned with or without levy, 5 Neb. 43. When several execu
tions are levied upon the same lands, separate proceedings and
appraisements, etc.. under each are unnecessary. 5 O. 522. Two
executions of the same kind may be issued on the same judg
ment, 16 O. 27. Of judgments rendered at the same term and
levied within the year, one does not gain a preference from the
iact that it was first levied, 13 O. 334.
§ 5383. Goods and chattels to be first taken ; for want
therecf, lands to he levied on. The officer to whom a
-writ of execution is delivered shall proceed, immedi
ately, to levy the same upon the goods and chattels of
the debtor ; but if no goods and chattels can be found,
the officer shall indorse on the execution the words " no
goods," and forthwith levy the same upon the lands and
tenements of the debtor which are liable to satisfy the
judgment. [51 v. 57, § 425 ; S. & C. 1069.]
Goods and chattels, when levied upon, ought to he taken into
the possession of sheriff, 4 O. 45. If they are of sufficient value to
satisfy the debt, and are lost by carelessness of the sheriff, he
will be liable to the creditor, and may be made to pay the debt,
Id. If levy is made before return day of the writ, sale may be
had afterwards. The rule applies to the order of sale, 7 Neb.
226. Return of writ without sale is an abandonment of levy on
personal property, 10 Neb. 419 ; see, generally, as to sufficiency
of levy on personal property, 2 O. 297 ; 0 O. 449; 10 O. S. 488; U
O. S. 18; 13 O. S. 79 ; 3:1 O. R. 85 ; 1 D. 405 ; 45 O. S. 222.
§ 5384. Id. When officer may take bond for their
delivery. When a sheriff, coroner, or other officer, levies,
by virtue of an execution, upon any goods and chattels
which afterward remain upon his hands unsold for want
of bidders, for the want of time to advertise and sell, or
for any other reasonable cause, the officer may, for his
own security, take of the defendant an undertaking,
with security, in such sum as he deems sufficient, to the
effect that the property shall be delivered to the officer
holding an execution for the sale of the same, at the
time and place appointed by such officer, either by notice
given in writing to the defendant in execution, or by
advertisement published in a newspaper printed in the
county, naming therein the day and place of sale ; and
if the defendant fail to deliver the goods and chattels at the time and place mentioned in the notice to him
given, or to pay to the officer holding the execution the
full value of such goods and chattels, or the amount of
the debt and costs, the undertaking shall be considered as
broken, and may be proceeded on as in other cases.
[51 v. 57, §429; S. & C. 1071.]
See 2 O. 297 ; 6 O. 450 ; 15 O. 65; 1 D. 144.
§ 5385. ICotioe of sale of goods on execution. The
officer who levies upon goods and chattels by virtue
of an execution issued by a court of record shall, before
he proceeds to sell the same, cause public notice to be
given of the time and place of sale, for at least ten days
before the day of sale, which notice shall be given by
advertisement published in a newspaper printed in the
county, or, if no newspaper is printed therein, by post
ing advertisements in five public places in the county,
two of which shall be put up in the township where the
sale is to be held. [66 v. 23, \ 430.]
Where a statute of the state requires a publication to be made
in a "newspaper," in the absence of any provision to the con
trary, a paper published in the English language is to be under
stood as intended ; and a publication in a paper printed in any
other language is not a compliance with the statute, 26 O. S. 49.
The making an inventory not necessary to constitute valid levy
upon personal property, 10 O. S. 488 (1860).
ji 5386. Alias execution against unsold goods. When
goods and chattels levied upon by execution can not be
sold for want of bidders, or want of time, the officer who
makes the return shall annex to the execution a true
and perfect inventory of the goods and chattels remain
ing unsold; and the plaintifff in such execution may
thereupon have another execution issued, directing the
sale of the property levied upon ; but such goods and
chattels shall not be sold unless the time and place of
sale be advertised as directed in the preceding section.
[66 v. 23, 1 430.]
An order of sale of personal property under this section pre
supposes a previous valid levy ; but where there is but a mere
paper levy, which is void, or where there lias been a valid levy
which has become fraudulent and void as against subsequent
creditors, such an order of sale is inoperative as against subse
quent executions actually levied on the property, 33 O. S. 85.
Where an order of sale, founded on such void levy, contains a
clause for an additional levy under § M88, it is valid as a fl.fn.
execution only, which may be levied on the property specified
in the original void levy as well as upon other property, Id.
Where property easily removable is seized in execution, but left
in the possession and use of the defendant, a delay for an un
reasonable time to offer said property for sale with the sanction
and assent of the plaintifff will have the effect of postponing
such levy to one made upon a junior execution, 14 O. S. 18.
§ 5387. Public and private sale of goods on execution.
All sales of goods and chattels shall be at public auc
tion ; but the court from which an execution or order of
sale issues, or a judge thereof in vacation, may, on good
cause shown, on application of either party, and due
notice to the adverse party, make an order directing the
sheriff, or other officer holding the process, to sell such
goods and chattels at private sale for cash, specifying
the time, not extending beyond the return day of the
process, during which such sale will continuo ; but
before such private sale is made, the court shall order
such personal property to be appraised by three disinter
ested persons ; and the property shall not be so sold for
less than two-thirds the appraised value thereof. [66 v.
23, \ 430.]
§ 5388. Further writ of oxecution may direct another
levy if the first be insufficient. When a writ is issued
directing the sale of property previously taken in exe
cution, the officer who issues the writ shall, if requested
by the person entitled to the benefit thereof, or his agent
or attorney, add thereto a command to the officer to
whom the writ is directed, that if, in his opinion, the
property remaining in his hands not sold is insufficient
to satisfy the judgment, he shall levy the same upon
lands and tenements, goods and chattels, or either, of the
judgment debtor, as the law permits, sufficient to satisfy
the debt. [51 v. 57, § 431 ; S. & C. 1072.]
See § 5386n ; 33 O. S. 85.
§ 5389. Land to be appraised before sale by three free
holders. When execution is levied upon lands and tene
ments, the officer who makes the levy shall call an
inquest of three disinterested freeholders, who shall be
residents of the county where the lands taken in exe
cution are situate, and administer to them an oath im
partially to appraise the property so levied upon, upon
actual view ; and such freeholders shall forthwith return
to such officer, under their hands, an estimate of the real
value of the property in money. [51 v. 57, \ 432 ; S. & C.
1073.]
Sale in chancery requires an appraisement, 1 O. 509; but a sale made to one not a party to the action, without an appraise
ment, vests in him a good title, 3 O. 187, overruling 1 O. 27 ; and
want of appraisement can not be objected to after confirmation,
W. 458. Court can not correct mistake in appraisement, 10 O. S.
557 ; but mistake can be corrected in equity, 35 O. S. 555. Where
there are two executions aud levies of the same date, and an
appraisement on each, and a second appraisement on one, no
valid sale cau be made on the other upon such second appraise
ment, 2 O. S. 406, 408. In sale upon execution of the interest of
a mortgagor, the appraisal must be of the entire estate, 8 O. 21 ;
but laud appraised as an entirety may be sold in parcels, 19 O.
19; 3 VV. L. (J. 245. Return of sheriff "is prima facie evidence of
the amount and nature of the appraisement, 29 O. S. 636. Return
should show that appraisers are residents of the county, 1 Neb.
409. Return need not embody or copy the appraisement, 2 O. S.
406. Actual view by appraisers necessary, 10 W. L. J. 207. Law
in force at time of sale governs, 3 O. 187 ; see 3 C. C. R. 144.
§ 5390. Copy of appraisement to be deposited with
olerk. When the officer receives the return he shall
forthwith deposit a copy thereof with the clerk of the
court from which the writ issued, and immediately
advertise and sell such real estate, agreeably to the pro
visions of this chapter. [51 v. 57, \ 433; S. & C. 1073.]
Copy of appraisement must be deposited with clerk before
advertisement or sale will be set aside on motion, 3 W. 1.. M. 319.
Such defect, after confirmation, would not impair purchaser's
title, 2 D. 503. Copy of appraisement deposited with clerk ctfn
not be considered bv the reviewing court, unless embodied in a
bill of exceptions, 29 O. S. 636.
§ 5391. Extent of lien. Lands not to be sold for less
than two-thirds of appraisement, except for debts, etc.,
due state. If, upon such return, it appear by the in
quisition that two-thirds of the appraised value of the
lands and tenements so levied upon is sufficient to satisfy
the execution, with costs, the judgment on which the exe
cution issued shall not operate as a lien on the residue
of the debtor's estate, to the prejudice of any other judg
ment creditor; but no tract of land shall be sold for less
than two-thirds of the value returned in the inquest;
and nothing in this section contained shall affect the sale
of lands by the state; but all lands, the property of
individuals indebted to the state for any debt or taxes,
or in any other manner, except for loans heretofore au
thorized by the legislature, shall be sold without valu
ation, for the discharge of such debt or taxes, agreeably
to the laws for such case made and provided. [51 v, 57,
H34; S. &C. 1073]
Sale for debt due state without valuation, 2 O. S. 328.
§ 5392. Property of certain officers to be Bold without
valuation. If the property of a clerk, sheriff, coroner,
justice of the peace, or constable, or of a collector of state,
county, municipal corporation, or township tax, be levied
on, for or on account of any money by him collected or
received in his official capacity, the property so levied on
shall be sold without valuation. [51 v. 57, §435 ; S. & C.
1074.]
§ 5393. Notice of sale of lands. Lands and tenements
taken in execution shall not be sold until the officer
causes to be given public notice of the time and place of
sale, for at least thirty days before the day of sale, by
advertisement in a newspaper printed and of general
circulation in the county, or, if no newspaper is printed
in the county, in a newspaper of general circulation
therein, and by putting up an advertisement of the same
upon the court-house door, and in five other public
places in the county, two of which shall be in the town
ship where the lands and tenements are situate ; when
the advertisement is made in a newspaper published
weekly, it shall be sufficient to insert it in five consecu
tive numbers thereof; but if there is published both a
daily and weekly edition of the newspaper selected for
such advertisement, and the circulation of the daily in
the county exceeds that of the weekly, or, if the lands
and tenements taken in execution are situate in any
city in this state, and there is published both a daily and
weekly edition of the newspaper selected for such adver
tisement, and the circulation of the daily in such city
exceeds that of the weekly, it shall be sufficient to pub
lish the advertisement in the daily once a week, for five
consecutive weeks, before the day of sale, each insertion
to be on the same day of the week ; but the expense of
such publication in a daily newspaper shall not exceed
the cost of publishing the same in a weekly newspaper;
and all sales made without such advertisement shall be
set aside, on motion, by the court to which the execution
is returnable. [56 v. 242, § 436 ; S. & C. 1074.]
When a newspaper is printed in the county, it is sufficient lor
the sheriff to advertise sales upon execution in it, and it is not
required that he should put up notices on the door of the court
house and at other places, 2 O. 78 ; 7 Neb. 459 ; 8 Id. 482. In com
puting the time for which notice of a sale on execution should
be advertised before the day of sale, as prescribed in this section, the day on 'which the notice was first published may be in
cluded, and the day of sale must be excluded. 3 4951 does not
apply in such case. When the notice is published in a daily
paper, as authorized by this section, it is sufficient if the first
publication be thirty days before the day of sale, 25 O. S. 186.
Where notice of the time and place of sale by a sheriff is adver
tised for thirty days before the day of sale in a weekly newspaper,
it is no objection that the first number containing the notice
was printed and published in advance of the day of the week
on which the publication was usually made, 29 O. S. 036. Where
an advertisement of a judicial sale is published in a semi-weekly
newspaper, it is not necessary that each insertion should be on
the same day of the week; but where an advertisement of a ju
dicial sale is published in a daily newspaper, and each insertion
is not on the same day of the week, this is not a mere irregularity
in the proceedings, but is such a defect as that a motion to set
aside the sale made thereunder on that ground, made before
confirmation, should be sustained, 1 C. C. R. 569.
§ 5394, Publication of notice in German newspaper.
In any county in which there is a city wherein is printed
and published a newspaper in the German language,
and which has a circulation of at least five hun
dred and fifty copies to bona fide subscribers within the
county, the notice required by the preceding section
shall, in addition to the publication therein required,
be published in such newspaper in the German lan
guage, for the same time, and in the same manner, if
the appraised value of the property to be sold exceeds
five hundred dollars, and if two or more such papers are
printed and published therein, the publication may be
in either; but the court shall, on motion of the defend
ant, and may without motion, for good cause, dispense
with such publication ; and in any county the court
may, if it deem the interests of the defendant require
it, direct the publication of the notice in a newspaper
printed in the Bohemian language, in addition to the
publication required by the preceding section ; but no
error or mistake in translation, or in any publication
authorized by this section, shall delay proceedings, or
affect the title of property sold ; and if any such error
or mistake occur by the negligence of the publisher,
he shall not be entitled to compensation for the publi
cation. [48 v. 27, § 1 i 55 v. 37, § 1 ; 73 v. 100, § 1 ; 76 v.
64, 1 23 ; S. & C. 1148, 1153 ; 86 v. 377.]
§ 5395. Return of the writ and record therecf. The sheriff shall indorse on the writ his proceedings thereon,
and the clerk shall immediately, upon the return thereof,
record at length, in the execution docket, or other docket
provided for that purpose, all such indorsements; and
the record shall be held to be a part of the record of the
court. [46 v. 95, \ 1 ; 49 v. 25, ? 1 ; S. & C. 1148, 1149.]
§ 5396. Duty of sheriff when money made without
sale of real estate. If the sheriff collect any part of a
judgment by virtue of an execution without the sale of
real estate, he shall pay the same to the judgment
creditor, or his attorney, upon demand made therefore at
his office ; and if the execution be fully satisfied, he
shall return it within three days after he has collected
the money thereon. [54 v. 104, \ \; S. & C. 1153.]
§ 5397. Purohaser failing to pay punished as for con
tempt. The court from which any execution or order of
sale issues shall, upon notice, and motion of the officer
who makes the sale, or of an interested party, punish
as for contempt any purchaser of real property who
fails to pay the purchase money therefore. [76 v. 27, § 1.]
§ 5398. Confirmation of sale. Order for deed. If, upon
the return of any writ of execution, for the satisfaction
of which lands and tenements have been sold, it be
found by the court, on careful examination of the pro
ceedings of the officer, that the sale has been made, in all
respects, in conformity to the provisions of this title, the
clerk shall be directed to make an entry on the journal
that the court is satisfied of the legality of such sale,
and that the officer make to the purchaser a deed for the
lands and tenements ; and the officer, on making the
sale, may retain the purchase money in his hands until
the court examines his proceedings, when he shall pay
the same to the person entitled thereto agreeably to the
order of the court. [51 v. 57, § 437 ; S. & C. 1074.]
Ihe proceedings of the sheriff must be examined and ap
proved by the court, and an order directing it obtained before
the execution of a deed, and if this course be not shown to have
been pursued a deed by the sheriff to the purchaser will
not be received as evidence of title, 1 O. 278. On a motion to
confirm a sale, the court has discretionary powers, and if it
appear that the notice was published in a paper not of general
circulation in the county it may refuse to confirm the sale, 16
O.563; but on such motion the court can only look to the
execution and proceedings under it, and can not look into
irregularities in obtaining the judgment or in the order awarding execution, 2 O. 360 ; see 2 C. S. C. R. 261 ; 9 O. 37. Payment
of judgment prevents confirmation, 42 O. S. 292 ; but a defect in
description not affecting the price docs not, 29 O. S. 636. Pur
chaser not objecting not excused by delay resulting in deprecia
tion of property, 15 O. S. 5 18. Confirmation will not be made
after an appeal. 10 O. S. 617. An appeal does not lie from an
order confirming or refusing to confirm a sale, 13 O. S. 574 ; nor
from an order of the probate court setting aside a sale made by
an assignee for the benefit of creditors, 31 O. S. 201 ; nor in par
tition, 10 Rec. 485. Confirmation refused for combination of
bidders, 10 O. 476 ; 2 D. 213 ; for misapprehension as to terms on
which sale was made, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 49. Sale on election day set
aside, 4 Bull 912; sot aside for mistake as to identity of subject
matter of sale, 11 Bull 56; but after confirmation, fraud in bid
ding can not be set up by purchaser, 1 Clev. R. 6 ; see 2 C. S. C. R.
201 ; nor mistake or uncertainty in order, 29 O. S. 651. Confirma
tion is res adjudicata, 15 O. S. 548. Resale not at purchaser's risk,
unless so ordered, 29 O. S. 529. Rights of purchaser, 11 Bull 13,
31; l9 Bull 221.
§ 5399. When master commissioner may convey real
estate. Eeal property may be conveyed by a master
commissioner or special master only, when, by an order
or a judgment in an action or proceeding, a party is
ordered to convey such property to another, and he
neglects or refuses to comply with the order or judg
ment, and the master is directed to convey on failure of
the party to comply with the order, when specific real
property is sold by a master under an order or judgment
of the court; but no court within this state shall make
or issue an order to any master commissioner for the
sale of any real estate, unless there exist some special
reason or reasons why the sale of suid real estate should
not be made by the sheriff' of the county where said de
cree or order shall be made, which said reason or rea
sons, if the court shall find any such to exist, shall be
embodied by said court in and made part of its judg
ment, order or decree ordering such sale. [81 v. 194;
51 v. 57, I 395 ; S. & C. 1057.]
An order of sale to the "sheriff or master." without naming
him, and executed by a master, is good after confirmation, 29
O. S. 651.
§ 5400. When sheriff may act as and for master com
missioner. A master commissioner or special master who
sells real property shall have the same power to admin
ister oaths that is conferred upon the sheriff; a sheriff
may act as a master commissioner, and shall, also, on
notice, and for a reasonable compensation to be paid by
the master commissioner out of his fees, attend and make sale for any such commissioner who, by reason of sick
ness, is unable to attend; and sales made by a master
shall conform, in all respects, to the laws regulating sales
of lands upon execution. [43 v. 87, \ 1 ; 51 v. 57, \ 396;
72 v. 68, \\ ; S. & C. 1057, 1148.]
Investment of balance of fund by order of court ; sheriff's lia
bility, 43 O. S. 380.
§ 5401. Seed of sheriff, master, etc. Recitals. An of
ficer, including a master commissioner and a special
master, who sells real property, shall, on confirmation
of the sale, make to the purchaser a deed, which shall
contain the names of the parties to the judgment, the
date and amount of the judgment, the substance of
the execution or order on which the property was sold,
the substance of the officer's return thereon, and the
order of confirmation ; and the deed shall be executed,
acknowledged, and recorded as is provided with respect
to other deeds. [51 v. 57, \\ 397, 438; S. & C. 1057,
1075.]
Execution of deed by deputy sufficient, 4 O. 8S. Under act
1811, acknowledgment before justice sufficient, 15 O. 735. Under
act 179'). acknowledgment must be in open court, 1 O. 281. It is
sufficient that a sheriff's deed recites so much of the execution
and proceedings as show a clear and undoubted authority for
the execution of the deed, 8 O. 128; 10 O. 433.
§ 5402. Effect of deed of sheriff, master, eto. The
deed shall be prima facie evidence of the legality and
regularity of the sale ; and all the estate and interest
of the person whose property the officer so professed to
sell and convey, whether that interest existed at the time
the property became liable to satisfy the judgment, or
was acquired subsequently, shall be thereby vested in
the purchaser. [51 v. 57, \ 438 ; S. & C. 1075.]
A sheriff's deed takes effect from the day of sale, and passes
the interest the judgment debtor had at the time of the levy 11
O. 235. And its recitals of the judgment, execution, levy, mid
sale are prima facie evidence that the land it conveys was levied
tjpon and sold; but such evidence may be rebutted by other
evidence that the land levied upon and sold is not the land cov
ered by the deed, 0 O. 536.
§ 6403. Printer's fees may be required in advanoe.
The officer who makes a levy, or holds an order of sale,
may, before giving notice of the sale, demand of the
plaintifff, his agent or attorney, the fees of the printer for publishing such notice ; and in such case the officer shall
not be required to make such publication until the fees
are paid. [51 v. 57, \\ 439, 440 ; S. & C. 1078.]
§ 5404. Where sales take place. Officer or appraiser
can not purchase. All sales of lands or tenements un
der execution or order of sale shall be held in the county
in which such lands and tenements are situate, and at
the court-house, unless otherwise ordered by the court ;
and purchases of real or personal property, by the officer
making sale thereof, or by an appraiser of such property,
shall be considered fraudulent and void; but this section
shall not affect, unless for fraud, sales by executors, ad
ministrators, or guardians, prior to March 29, 1841. [39
v. 42, & 1, 2; 51 v. 57, I 441 ; S. & C. 1079, 1147.]
Purchase by appraiser voidable only, 14 O. S. 80.
§ 5405. Alias execution against lands. If lands and
tenements levied on, or ordered to be sold, be not sold
upon one execution, other executions may be issued to
sell the same. [51 v. 57, § 442 ; S. & C. 1079.]
§ 5406. Proceedings when creditors direct separate
levies to be made on separate parcels of land. When
two or more executions come to the hands of an officer,
and it is necessary to levy on real estate to satisfy the
same, and either of the judgment creditors, or his as
signee, requires the officer to make a separate levy to
satisfy his execution or executions, the officer shall obey
the direction; but the officer who makes the levy on be
half of the creditor whose execution may, by the pro
visions of this chapter, bo entitled to a preference, shall
have the choice of such part of the real property of the
judgment debtor or debtors as will be sufficient, at twothirds of the appraised value, to satisfy the same; when
two or more executions, which are entitled to do prefer
ence as to each other, are put in the hands of the same
officer, he shall, when required, levy the same on sep
arate parcels of the real property of the judgment debtor
or debtors, if, in the opinion oi the appraisers, the same
may be divided without material injury; and if the real
property of such debtor or debtors be not sufficient, at
two-thirds of its appraised value, to satisfy all the exe
cutions chargeable thereon, such part of the same shall
be levied on, to satisfy each execution, as will bear the
same proportion in value to the whole, as the amount due on the execution bears to the amount of all the exe
cutions chargeable thereon, as near as may be, according
to the appraised value of each separate parcel. [51 v. 57,
§ 443 ; S. & C. 1079.] 7 Bull 148; 1 Clev. Rep. 86.
§ 5407. Successor of sheriff may make deeds for lands
sold by predecessor. If the term of service of the officer
who makes sale of any lands and tenements expires, or
if such officer die, be absent, or unable from any cause
to make a deed of conveyance of the property sold, any
successor of such officer, on receiving a certificate from
the court from which execution issued for the sale of the
lands and tenements, signed by the clerk, by order of the
court, setting forth that sufficient proof has been made
that the sale was fairly and legally made, and, on tender
of the purchase money, or if the same, or any part
thereof, has been paid, then, on proof of such payment,
and tender of the balance, if any, may execute to the
purchaser, or his legal representative, a deed of con
veyance of the lands and tenements sold; and such deed
shall be as good and valid in law, and have the same
effect, as if the officer who made the sale had executed
the same. [51 v. 57, 1 444 ; S. & C. 1079.]
§ 5408. After satisfaction of execution, balance to be
paid to defendant. When, on any sale made as aforesaid,
there is in the hands of the officer more money than is
sufficient to satisfy the writ or writs of execution, with
interest and costs, the officer shall, on demand, pay the
balance to the defendant in execution, or his legal repre
sentatives. [51 v. 57, \ 445 ; S. & C. 1080.]
§ 5409. Reversal of judgment not to affect title of pur
chaser. If a judgment, in satisfaction of which lands
or tenements are sold, bj thereafter reversed, such re
versal shall not defeat or affect the title of the purchaser ;
but in such case restitution shall be made by the judg
ment creditor, of the money for which such lands or ten
ements were sold, with lawful interest from the day of
sale. [51 v. 57, \ 446; S. & C. 1080.]
14 O. S. 349 ; 27 O. S. 471 . Notice to a purchaser, at administra
tor's sale to pay debts, that an effort would be made to reverse
the order, does not affect the purchaser's title, though the order
is subsequently reversed, 3 O. S. 389. " But this statutory rule,
which applies only to purchases by strangers, does not appiy to
a mortgagee who is a party, nor where the order of sale or con
firmation is reversed. In such cases the rule is as stated in McBain's case," 38 O. S. 672, 676. In McBain's case it was held that where an order confirming a sale to a party is reversed after a
sheriff's deed has been executed, the title, if any, of the pur
chaser is divested by the order of reversal, 15 O. S. 337 Mistake
corrected in equity after confirmation, see 35 O. S. 555.
§ 5410. Remedy of purchaser at sale, if sale invalid.
If, upon the sale of property on execution, the title of
the purchaser is invalid by reason of a defect in the pro
ceedings. the"purchaser may be subrogated to the right
of the creditor against the debtor, to the extent of the
money paid and applied to the debtor's benefit, and, to the
same extent, shall have a lien on the property sold, as
against all persons, except bona fide purchasers without
notice; but this section shall not be construed to require
the creditor to refund the purchase money, by reason of
the invalidity of any such sales. [44 v. 114, § 1 ; S. & C.
1149.]
§ 5411. Remedy in other cases of invalid sales. The
last section shall apply, also, to all sales by order of
court, sales by executors, administrators, guardians, and
assignees, and to all sales for taxes. [44 v. 114, §2;

§ 5412. Proceedings to vacate satisfaction of judgment.
When a plaintifff in execution, or his agent, has, in good
faith, ordered a levy of execution upon property not
subject thereto, and the same has been sold ana applied
on his judgment, and a recovery therefore has been had
against him by the owner of the property, the person so
recovered against, and having paid the amount so recov
ered, may, on motion in the court having control of the
judgment, upon giving the judgment defendant notice
of such motion, have the satisfaction, so made from the
sale of the property on execution, vacated, and shall be
entitled to collect the judgment. [48 v. 97, \ 1 ; S. & C.
1150.]
§ 5413, Relief of officer who levies upon and sells
wrong property in good faith. When an officer to whom
an execution has been issued upon a judgment levies the
execution, in good faith, upon property not subject
thereto, and sells the same, and applies the proceeds in
satisfaction, or part satisfaction, of the judgment, and a
recovery is had against him for its value, the officer,
upon payment of such value, and on motion before the
court having control of the judgment, and a showing to
the court that due notice of such motion has been given to the defendant named in the execution, may have the
satisfaction of such judgment, so made from the sale of
such property, vacated, and execution shall issue there
for, for the use of such officer, the same as if such levy
and sale had not been made. [48 v. 97, \ 2 ; S. & C. 1150.]
§ 5414. Remedy when defendant or surety etc., pays
for such property. When a defendant in a judgment,
or a surety or co-surety of such defendant, has, by
mistake, directed an execution issued on the judg
ment to be levied on property not liable to such ex
ecution, and thereby caused such judgment to be wholly
or in part satisfied, and has been compelled to pay the
owner of such property therefore, he shall be adjudged to
have the same rights against any co-defendant in such
judgment, and against any co-surety or principal, in re
spect of the debts on which such judgment is founded, as
though such satisfaction had, by due process of law, been
made out of the property of such defendant, surety, or co
surety, bo directing such levy. [48 v. 97, \ 3 ; S. & C. 1151.]
§ 5415. When judgment loses preference. No judg
ment, on which execution is not issued and levied before
the expiration of one year next after its rendition, shall
operate as a lien on the estate of a debtor to the preju
dice of any other bona fide judgment creditor; but in all
cases in which judgment is rendered in the circuit court
or supreme court, and a special mandate is directed to
the common pleas court to carry the same into execution,
the lien of the judgment creditor shall continue for one
year after the first day of the term of the common pleas
court to which such mandate is directed, or, if the man
date be entered on the journal in vacation, after it is so
entered ; and in computing such period of one year, the
time covered by an appeal of the case, or by an injunc
tion against the execution, or by proceedings in error, or
by a vacancy in the office of sheriff and coroner, or by
the inability of such officers, shall be excluded. [82 v.
35; 65 v. 202, § 447 ; S. & S. 563.]
Levy must be made within a year after the rendition of a
judgment to retain priority, 3 O. 135, 136, 366 ; 5 O. 398 ; 6 O. 30;
9 O. 142. A junior judgment levied within the year has a pref
erable lien to a senior judgment levied on same property after
the year, 5 O. 398 ; 6 O. 30. A levy made within the year and set
aside after the expiration of the year loses its lien as against a
subsequent judgment upon which a levy is made within the
year and continued to the sale, 2 O. 65, 395 ; 3 O. 366 ; and when a judgment is modified, and a levy set aside at the same term,
the lien of the judgment is not preserved by the provisions of
§ 5360, which applies only to modifications after the term, 24
.S.114. Judgments not levied within the year rank from the
date of levy, 5 O. 398. The lieu of a senior judgment which has
not been levied within the year will not be defeated by a sale
upon a junior mortgage made within the year from the decree of
foreclosure, 16 O. 449. As between a senior judgment not levied
within the year, an intervening mortgage, and a junior judg
ment levied within the year, the senior judgment has the first
lien, the mortgage the second, and the junior judgment the last,
14 O. 318; 16 O. 533. A mortgage delivered for record on the first
day of the term of court, and before court actually convenes, it
has been held, will prevail against the lien of a judgment recov
ered at the same term, 16 O. Ill, 534; but where the judges had,
under a statute, fixed 10 o'clock A. M. as the hour for the com
mencement of the term, and their order was entered on the
journal, it was held that the record was conclusive as to the hour
when the term began, and that the lien of a judgment was
superior to that of a mortgage delivered for record at 1 1 o'clock
A. M., although the fact was that the court did not actually con
vene till afternoon, 17 O. S. 231 ; see 24 O. S. 150. A levy on other
property does not save lien on specific property, 3 O. 136, and a
levy on propertv of principal does not save lien on that of surety,
3 O. 135.
§ 5416. New appraisement for sale on execution. When
real estate, taken on execution and appraised, and twice
advertised and offered for sale, remains unsold for want
of bidders, the court from which the execution issued
shall, on motion of the plaintifff, set aside such appraise
ment, and order a new appraisement to be made, or set
aside such levy and appraisement, and award a new execu
tion to issue, as the case may require; and when such real
estate, or any part thereof, has been three times appraised
as aforesaid, and thereafter twice advertised and offered
for sale, and then remains unsold for want of bidders,
the court mav direct the amount for which the same shall
be sold. [65 v. 202, 1 447 ; S. & S. 563.]
When an assignee has commenced an action to sell the realty
of the assignor as provided in § 6351, the provisions of this sec
tion applv to subsequent proceedings to sell under the decree
therein made, 40 O. 330, 331.
§ 5417. New appraisement. Terms of sale of mortgaged
premises. When premises are ordered to be sold, and,
having been twice advertised and offered for sale, remain
unsold for want of bidders, the court from which the
order of sale issued shall, on motion of the plaintifff or
defendant, order a new appraisement, and may also order
that the land be sold on time, as follows : One-third cash in hand, one-third in nine months from the day of sale,
and the remaining third in eighteen months from the
day of sale, the deferred payments to draw six per cent,
interest, and to be secured by mortgage on the oremises
[67 v. 114, § 374.]
§ 5418. When executions to be returned. The officer
to whom a writ of execution is directed shall return
such writ to the court to which it is returnable within
sixty days from the date thereof. [51 v. 57, \ 448 ; S. & C.
1083.]
And it is error for the court under the authority of which it
is issued, without any return thereof, to order the same writ to
be extended ; and a sale made on such extended writ after the
expiration of the sixty days should be set aside, 2 C. C. R. 330.
If such sale is confirmed, a reviewing court may set aside such
sale and confirmation, Id.; but it was held that the failure of
the sheriff to lile in the clerk's office his return on an alias order
of sale within sixty aays from the date of issuing was not such
an irregularity or neglect in the proceedings as would be re
garded on error after a confirmation of sale thereunder, 1 C. C. R.
569. An amendment of the return may be made, but it must be
made within a reasonable time, and rests in the sound discre
tion of the court, 4 O. 59. It can not, however, be amended so
as to affect prior levies or liens. 13 O. 220 ; and if an amendment
is made, the lien will only operate as to third persons from the
date of amendment, Id. as between parties, privies, and the
officer, except where the latter is charged upon its falsity, the
return is matter of record and thereforee conclusive, 4 O. 135, 137,
and before it can be controverted there must be direct proceed
ings against the officer. No collateral impeachment is permit
ted, 2 D. 318, but the date of the return is not conclusive, 10
O. S. 28, and a defect in the description in a levy may be sup
plied by parol evidence, 3 O. 272 ; 5 O. 522. On injunction to
stay execution after a levy on chattels, the sheriff i3 bound to
restore the chattels levied on to the owner, 3 O. 449.
§ 5419. How judgment against principal and surety
entered. When judgment is rendered in a court of rec
ord within this state, upon an instrument of writing in
which two or more persons are jointly or severally
bound, and it is made to appear to the court, by parol
or other testimony, that one or more of the persons so
bound signed the same as surety or bail for his or their
co-defendant, the clerk of such court, in recording the
judgment thereon, shall certify which of the defendants
is principal debtor, and which surety or bail; the clerk
shall issue execution on such judgment, commanding
the officer to cause the money to be made of the goods
and chattels, lands and tenements, of the principal debtor, or, for want of sufficient property of the principal debtor
to make the same, that he cause the same to be made
of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the
surety or bail ; and the property, both personal and real,
of the principal debtor, within the jurisdiction of the
court, shall be exhausted before any of the property of
the surety or bail shall be taken in execution. [51 v. 57,
H49; S. & C. 1083.]
The consent of parties to a judgment in open court at the
time it is rendered, that one or more of the defendants may be
certified as sureties, is sufficient, 36 O. S. 155. The omission to
make the certificate, 11O. 310, or refusal of the court to make it,
3 Bull 547 (but see obiter 11 O. 310), can not be corrected by a
proceeding in error. If sureties neglect, when judgment is ren
dered, to cause the entry to be made, chancery will not compel
the judgment creditor to first exhaust the property of the prin
cipal, 16 O. 27. Yet if, with a knowledge of the suretyship, the
judgment creditor levies upon unincumbered land of the prin
cipal debtor, and afterwards abandons the levy without theconsent of the surety, the surety will be discharged to the extent of
the vulue of the land released from the levy, 40 O. S. 446. Such
finding by the court and certificate in the judgment showing
who are principals and who are sureties do not conclude the
parties in a subsequent action for contribution ; and the effect
of such finding and certificate is not changed by the fact that
the defendants appeared at the trial and filed answers, in which
each alleged that the others were principal debtors, 25 O. S. 89.
Where the holder of a joint and several obligation elects to sue
one of the obligors who is only a surety thereon, it is not com
petent for the defendant, by cross-petition or otherwise, to bring
in his principal for the purpose of having the relation of princi
pal and surety certified under this section, although the holder
knew that such relation existed, 31 O. S. 565.
§ 5420. Appraisers' fees. Penalty for neglecting to
serve as appraiser. Each appraiser of real estate under
the provisions of this chapter shall receive fifty cents per
day for his services, to be collected on the execution by
virtue of which the property appraised was levied on ;
and when any freeholder, summoned as an appraiser,
fails to appear at the time and place appointed by the
officer, and discharge his duty as appraiser, he shall, on
complaint made to a justice of the peace of the township
in which he resides, forfeit and pay the sum of fifty
cents for every such neglect, unless he render a reason
able excuse, which shall be collected by the justice, and
paid into the township treasury, for the use of the town
ship. [51 v. 57, § 450 ; S. & C. 1084.]
§ 5421. Execution issned to another oounty may be
returned by mail. When execution is issued in any county, and directed to the sheriff or coroner of another
county, the sheriff or coroner having the execution may,
after having discharged all the duties required of him
by law, transmit such execution, by mail, to the clerk
of the court who issued it ; and on proof made by such
sheriff or coroner that the execution was mailed soon
enough to have reached the office where it was issued
within the time prescribed by law, he shall not be liable
for any amercement or penalty if it does not reach the
office in due time. [51 v. 57, § 454 ; S. & C. 1086.]
§ 5422. Money not to be forwarded by mail, unless, etc.
No sheriff or coroner shall forward by mail any money
made on such execution, unless he be specially in
structed to do so by the plaintifff, his agent, or attorney
of record. [64 v. 64, \ 455 ; W. & S. 565.]
§ 5423. Execution docket. The clerk of the court of
common pleas shall enter upon the execution docket the
names, in full, of the parties to the cause in which an
execution is issued, the number of the cause upon the
appearance docket, the number of the execution, the
date of its issue, the amount of the judgment, the costs
due each person or officer, the time when the judgment
was rendered, and the date of the return ; and the return
shall be recorded [therein] in full. [75 v. 690, § 51.]
§ 5424. Index to execution docket. The clerk shall
keep an index to the execution docket, showing, in sepa
rate columns, the names of all parties against whom and
in whose favor an execution has been issued, the num
ber of the execution, and the number of the cause upon
the appearance docket. [34 v. 45, § 2 ; S. & C. 1280.]
See I 5339.
§ 5425, Proceedings when order of sale issued in case
not on trial dooket. When an order of sale is issued in
a case not on the trial docket, the clerk shall enter it on
the execution docket, and enter the subsequent proceed
ings had in pursuance thereof, in the same manner that
executions and proceedings thereon are entered ; when a
sale of real estate is made in pursuance of such order, it
shall be confirmed in all respects as sales on executions
are confirmed ; and after the sale the officer shall be
governed in all respects by the law relating to sales on
execution. [55 v. 26, I 306 ; S. & C. 1034.]
§ 5426. Property of unmarried women exempt from
execution, Every unmarried woman may hold the fol
lowing property exempt from execution, attachment, or
sale, to satisfy any judgment or order, to wit:
1. Wearing apparel, to be selected by her, not exceed
ing in value one hundred dollars.
2. One sewing-machine.
3. One knitting-machine.
4. A bible, hymn-book, psalm-book, and any other books
not exceeding in value twenty-five dollars. [71 v. 59, § 1.]
§ 5427. Beneficiary funds exempt. Any beneficiary
fund, not exceeding five thousand dollars, set apart, ap
propriated, or paid, by any benevolent association or
society, according to its rules, regulations, or by-laws, to
the family of any deceased member, or to any member
of such family, shall not be liable to be taken by any
process or proceedings, legal or equitable, to pay any
debt of such deceased member. [71 v. 76, ? 1.]
§ 5428. Certain property of benevolent societies ex
empt. The regalia, insignia of office, journals of pro
ceedings, account-books, and the private work, belonging
to any benevolent society in this state, shall be exempt
from seizure or sale to satisfy any judgment or decree
hereafter rendered against such society. [76 v. 135, § 1.]
§ 5429. Property kept and used to extinguish fires
exempt. All property used, or kept to be used, by any
municipal corporation or fire company, for the purpose
of extinguishing fire, shall be exempt from execution
and sale to satisfy any judgment or order arising upon
contract or otherwise ; but the owner thereof may create
valid liens thereon by bill of sale or mortgage. [56 v.
36, ?1; S. &C. 1147.]
§ 5430. Exemptions to heads of families and widows.

3. The bibles, hymn-books, psalm-books, testaments,

4. Provisions, see 2 W. L. M. 585 ; 2 W. L. J. 402.
6. Earnings for three months, 25 O. S. 516 (§ 5483), but not ex
empt when husband does not live with or support family, 1 Clev.
Rep. 140. A citizen of this state may be enjoined from prose
cuting an attachment in another state against a citizen of this
state to subject to the payment of his claim the earnings of the
debtor which by the laws of this state are exempt from being
applied to the payment of such claim, 25 O. S. 516.
§ 5431. Special exemptions to physicians, draymen, etc.
Every person who is the head of a family, and engaged
in the business of draying for a livelihood, shall, in addi
tion to the exemptions specified in the preceding section,
hold one horse, narness, and dray exempt from execu
tion; every head of a family who is engaged in the
business of agriculture shall, in addition to the exemp
tions provided for in the preceding section, hold exempt
from execution one horse, or one yoke of cattle, with the
necessary gearing for the same, and one wagon ; and
every head of a family who is engaged in the practice of
medicine shall, in addition to the exemptions specified
in said section, hold one horse, one saddle and bridle,
and also books, medicines, and instruments, pertaining
to his profession, not exceeding one hundred dollars in
value, exempt from execution. [70 v. 132, \ 2.]
A person residing in a village, and cultivating in corn, pota
toes, cabbage, beans, etc., two town lots containing less than
half an acre of land, is not one " engaged in the business of agri
culture" within the meaning of this section, 4 Bull 540 ; 8 Rec.
15. A " buggy " is not included in the term " wagon," Id. A
horse of any value is exempt for agriculture, 8 W. L. J. 561'.
§ 5432. Appraisal of exempted property. In all cases
where it is necessary to ascertain the amount or value of
personal property exempt under this subdivision, it shall
be estimated and appraised by two disinterested house
holders of the county, to be selected by the officer hold
ing the execution, and by him sworn to impartially
make such appraisement. [70 v. 132, \ 3; 70 v. 51, § 3.]
§ 5433. Provisions with respect to exemptions to apply
to all courts. The provisions contained in this subdi
vision with respect to exemptions shall apply to all
courts in this state, including justices of the peace and
mayors' courts, so that a person shall be entitled to all
the exemptions in any case or proceeding, or before any

case or proceeding, or before any other court or officer.
[75 v. 692, t 61.]
§ 5434. When subsequent sections do not apply. The
subsequent sections of this subdivision shall not extend
to a judgment rendered on a mortgage executed by a
debtor and his wife, nor to a claim for manual work or

chase money of the premises in question, nor the lien
of a mechanic, or other person, under any statute of
this statej for materials furnished or labor performed in
the erection of the dwelling-house thereon, nor for the
payment of taxes due thereon. [82 v. 219 ; 48 v. 29, \ 7.]
Claim for work and labor, 5 Bull 815.
No exemption in case of judgments under liquor laws in
consequence of unlawful sales, except under \ 6430; see \ 4363 ;
against judgment under (faming laws, § 4275; nor for taxes and
penalties under " Dow Liquor Law," 83 v. 158, § 4.
§ 5435. When husband and wife entitled to homestead ;
widow; widower. Husband and wife living together, a
widow, or a widower living with an unmarried daughter
or unmarried minor son, may hold exempt from sale, on
judgment or order, a family homestead not exceeding
one thousand dollars in value ; and the husband, or, in
casj of his failure or refusal, the wife, shall have the
right to make the demand therefore; but neither can
make such demand if the other has a homestead. [66
v. 48, §1;68 v. 106, §4]
§ 40 O. S. 183 ; 3 C. C. R. 488.
Husband and wife can not both have a homestead exemption,
23 O. S. 603 ; 3 Bull 2% ; but when homestead property is held by
them in common, the husband is not precluded from claiming an
exemption therein, 11 Hull 65. A wife is entitled to a homestead
in husband's mortgaged property, she not having joined in the
mortgage, 8 Rec. 411; 1 C. C. R. 41; §5442; but not to a home
stead in mortgage before marriage, 29 O. S. 636; nor in mortgage
of non-homestead land, 29 O. S. 523. A widow is entitled to
homestead in addition to dower, 2 W. L. M. 426 ; 39 O. S. 865; see
25443. She is entitled to a homestead, though not living with an
"unmarried, daughter or unmarried minor son,'.' 39 O. S. 336;
but she is not entitled to a homestead in lands of her deceased
husband under this section, 29 O. S. 569. A widower with no
other family than an unmarried daughter, though she is over
the age of minority, may claim the benefit of the exemption, 9
Bull 337. A homestead may be acquired by occupation at any
time before levy, 41 O. S. 180. It mav be lost by neglect or
refusal to claim it, or bv abandonment, 24 O. S. 488; 32 O. S. 44;);
42 O. S. 139. It is not lost by leasing the property, 12 O. S. 431;
nor defeated by a fraudulent conveyance when set aside, 41 O. S.
206, citing 14 O. S. 298 ; 28 O. S. 61 ; see 2 Clev. R. 9; 42 O. S. 165.
The proper time for the assertion of the debtor's claim is when the officer is about to execute the writ of execution or order of
sale, 14 O. S. 298. The right to a homestead is a personal privi
lege and can not be conveyed to another, 42 O. S. 139. The
amount of the homestead exemption is to be determined by the
law in force when the debt was contracted, 1 C. C. R. 41 ; see 4
W. L. M. 149. A homestead is subject to judgment or execution
lien before and after the same is demanded and set off to the
debtor, 42 O. S. 139, 165. A wife's separate property is not hus
band's homestead, 20 O. S. 473; her general property may be,
2 W. L. M. 327. A tenancy for one year is not a homestead, 15
O. S. 279 ; nor is land purchased and not paid for, 2 W. L. M. 685.
Homestead can not be allowed on partition, 5 W. L. M. 25; 8
Rec. 654; can only be claimed as against creditors, 8 Rec. 654;
not allowed in action against watercraft, 27 O. S. 517. Proceed
ings against must be before court issuing process, 12 O. S. 431.
§ 5436. Preceding section applies to owner of super
structures and lessees. A person owning the superstruct
ure of a dwelling-house occupied by him or her as a
family homestead, although the title to the land upon
which the same is built is in another, and also lessees,
shall be entitled to the benefit of the preceding section,
in the same manner as the owner of the freehold or
inheritance ; but this section shall not be construed to
prevent a sale of the fee simple, subject to the lease.
[48 v. 29, §5; S.'&C. 1145.]
A tenancy of a house, stable, and parcel of land, for a single
year, where the debtor does not claim the same as a homestead,
is not an ownership of a homestead, within the meaning of this
section, so as to deprive the holder of the benefit of the exemp
tion of personalty from execution in lieu of homestead under
§ 5441 ; 15 O. S. 279.
§ 5437. Homestead for decedent's family. On petition
of executors or administrators to sell, to pay debts, the
lands of a decedent who has left a widow, or a minor
child unmarried, and composing part of the decedent's
family at the time of his death, the appraisers shall pro
ceed to set apart a homestead as provided in the next
section, and the same shall, except as otherwise pro
vided in \ 6155, K. S., remain exempt from sale on exe
cution, and exempt from sale under any order of the
court so long as the widoWg if she remain unmarried, or
any unmarried minor child of said decedent, resides
thereon. [86 v. 6.]
A homestead having been assigned by metes and hounds,
under the act of 1850, 3 5435 et fie^., to the widow and unmarried
minor children of a decedent, in a proceeding in the probate
court by an executor to sell lands to pay debts, orders of such
court in the proceeding, directing and confirming a sale of the
real estate so assigned, subject to the homestead, and while the same is occupied as such homestead, are not merely voidable,
out void, 39 O. S. 365. Under a previous statute, after all the
children of the intestate arrived at full age, the widow was held
not to be entitled longer to hold a homestead previously set off
to her, and the lands were, on petition of the administrator,
allowed to be sold to pay the debts of the estate. 29 O. H. 569.
Where a widow was allowed five hundred dollars in lieu of
homestead, on sale by administrator, this was held not error to
the prejudice of the administrator and creditors, no application
having been made to set off the homestead, and the court still
having control of the fund, 6 Bull 636.
§ 5438. How homestead set off. Either party may oomplain of assignment. The officer executing any writ of
execution founded on a judgment or order shall, on ap
plication of the debtor, hia wife, agent, or attorney, at
any time before sale, if such debtor has a family, and if
the lands or tenements about to be levied upon (l),or any
part or parcel thereof, constitute the homestead thereof,
cause the inquest of appraisers, upon their oaths, to set
off to such debtor, by metes and bounds, a homestead
not exceeding one thousand dollars in value; such as
signment of the homestead shall be returned by the offi
cer along with the writ, and shall be copied by the clerk
into the execution docket; and if no complaint be made
by either party, no further proceedings shall be had
against the homestead; but the remainder of the debtor's
lands and tenements, if any thore be, shall be liable to
sale on execution ; upon complaint of either party, and
upon good cause shown, the court out of which the writ
issued may order a re-appraisement and re-assignment
of the homestead ; but if no application be made during
the lifetime of the debtor, it may be made by the widow
of the judgment debtor at any time before a sale. [66 v.
48, ? 2.J 1. 41 O. S. 180 ; 46 O. S. 183.
§5439. Procedure when homestead not divisible. When
the homestead of a debtor in execution consists of a
house and a lot of land which, in the opinion of the
appraisers, will not bear division without manifest injury
and inconvenience, the plaintifff in execution shall re
ceive, in lieu of the proceeds of a sale of the homestead,
the amount over and above one hundred dollars, an
nually, adjudged by the appraisers as a fair and reason
able rent for the same, until the debt, costs, and interest
are paid ; the rent, over and above one hundred dollars,
shall be' payable in quarterly payments, commencing three months from the time of the levy of the execution,
and may be paid to the plaintifff in execution, or to his
assigns, or to the clerk of the court of common pleas of
the county in which the homestead is situate, and the
clerk shall give to the person paying the same a proper
receipt, and enter the same on the execution docket with
out charge; if the rent be not paid quarterly, as above
provided, or within ten days after each and every pay
ment becomes due, the officer shall proceed and sell the
homestead, in th3 same manner as is provided in other
cases for the sale of real estate, but it shall not be sold
for less than its appraised value; the plaintifff in execu
tion, the judgment debtor, or any other person to whom,
under any law of this state, such homestead has been set
off, may cau*e the homestead to be re-appraised once in
two years, in the same manner as provided for in the pre
ceding section, and the rent shall, after such re-appraise
ment, be paid in accordance therewith; and if such reappraisement be made at the instance of the plaintifff
in execution, and the appraisement be not increased one
hundred dollars over the amount of the next previous
appraisement, the costs thereof shall be paid by the
plaintifff in execution ; but in all other cases the costs of
the re-appraisement shall be taxed as costs in the original
case. [75 v. 43, § 6.]
Rent on indivisible homestead begins at date of order of sale,
7 Rec. 605
§ 5440. Allowance in lien of homestead, and of pro
ceeds of sale therecf. When a homestead is charged with
liens, some of which, as against the head of the family,
or the wife, preclude the allowance of a homestead to
either of them, and others of such liens do not preclude
such allowance, and a sale of such homestead is had,
then, after the payment, out of the proceeds of such sale,
of the liens so precluding such allowance, the balance,
not exceeding five hundred dollars, shall be awarded to
the head of the family, or the wife, as the case may be,
in lieu of such homestead, upon
in person, or by agent or attorney. [66 v. 48, § 4.]
The balance, not exceeding five hundred dollars, shall be
awarded to the head of the family, 20 O. S. 471 ; 32 O. S. 443 ; see
43 O. S. 63, or the wife on her application, 31 O. S. 437, though the
land has been fraudulently conveyed. 42 O. S. 165; 41 O. S. 206;
but neither the husband nor the wife is entitled to an allowance out of the proceeds as against a debt which both attempted to
secure by mortgage upon such homestead, duly executed, ac
knowledged, and recorded, the legal validity of such mortgage
being defeated by a mutual mistake in the description of the
gremises, 2 C. C. it. 27; and when the wife is living apart from
er husband, under a judicial decree allowing her alimonv, she
is not entitled to the allowance, 13 Bull 637 ; and if the debtor
voluntarily abandons his homestead before claiming it as ex
empt, 32 O. S. 443, or before the surplus fund is disposed of by
the court, 24 O. S. 488, his right to such exemption is forfeited;
but where the property was destroyed by fire before sale, and
the debtor removed from it, though v. ith no intention to rebuild,
it was held, under the circumstances of the case, that there was
no such abandonments^ precluded the right to claim the exemp
tion, and that out of the surplus, after payment of the preferred
liens, upon the application of the debtor's wife, an allowance to
her might be made in lieu of the homestead, 31 O. S. 437. This
section does not apply to debts contracted before its passage ; but,
independently of it, the debtor's right to the exemption attaches
to the surplus of the proceeds of such sale as against creditors
whose claims do not preclude the allowance of a homestead, Id.
The right to a homestead is fixed when the fund is disposed of,
24 O. S. 488 ; 40 Id. 345 ; see 2 C. C. R. 63, and I 5441n.
§ 5441, Five hundred dollars' worth of property exempt
in certain cases. Husband and wife living together, a
widower living with an unmarried daughter or minor
son, every widow, and every unmarried female having in
good faith the care, maintenance and custody of any
minor child or children of a deceased relative, risidents
of Ohio, and not the owner of a homestead, may, in lieu
thereof, hold exempt from levy and sale real or personal
property to be selected by such person, his agent or at
torney, at any time before sale not exceeding five
hundred dollars ($500) in value, in addition to the
amount of chattel propertv otherwise by law exempted.
[81 v. 148 ; 70 v. 51, § 3 ; 66 v. 50.]
"Husband and wife living together." But a wife living apart
from her husband, under judicial decree allowing her alimony,
is not entitled to the exemption, 13 Bull 637 ; and when real es
tate occupied as a family homestead is owned cither by husband
or wife, neither can hold exempt from execution the personal
property allowed by this section in lieu of homestead, 23 O. S.
603; but where the execution debtor's wife owns bind which is
their homestead, but before the levy upon goods they have re
moved from it, and it is not then their homestead, the debtor
may claim exemption of personal property in lieu of homestead,
40O.S. 232. "Widow," "widower," ete. See§5435n. "Residentsof
Ohio." The section formerly provided that, "It shall be lawful
for any resident of Ohio, being the head of a family and not the
owner of a homestead," etc. (66 v. 50); see 9 O. S. 425. Under
this amendment, it was held that the members of an insolvent
firm were not entitled to the statutory exemptions out of the partnership property after it had been seized in execution by
partnership creditors, notwithstanding fill the members joined
in demanding the exemptions, 26 O. S. 317, but that after the dis
solution and sale of the interest of one member to the other the
latter might hold such property exempt from the payment of a
debt thereafter asserted against him on the ground that such
debt was a partnership debt due at the time of the dissolution,
38 O. S. 401, and see 1 C. S. C. R. 404 ; 3 Bull 788 ; 4 Id. 986. " Not
the owner of a homestead." 40 O. S. 232 ; 43 O. S. 63 (equity of re
demption subjected by creditor); see 3 C. C. R. 488. Though
the property is mortgaged for more than its value, the
benefit of the exemption can not be claimed, as the debtor is
still the owner, 41 O. .S. 377 ; 15 Bull 310. " Exempt from levy and
tale." Marriage of the debtor subsequent to levy and before
sale does not entitle the debtor to the benefit of the exemption,
40 O. S. 345, 346; 2 C. C. R. 63, reversing 15 Bull 358; see 41 O. S.
180. "Personal property " includes credits and monies selected
by the debtor. Credits and monies selected by the debtor can
not be taken and held under an order of attachment or by gar
nishee process, 36 O. S. 545; see 25 O. S. 320. "To be (elected."
Personal property is exempt only when selected. Untilsclection
it is subject to levy and sale, 38 O. S. 416. There is no presump
tion of law that a judgment debtor has selected or 'Will claim to
hold any particular item of personal property as exempt from
execution in lieu of a homestead, although he may not own any
other property from which selections might be made, Id. The
right may be waived, as where the debtor fixed a time and place
for meeting the officer and making the selection, and purposely
failed to attend , 29 O. S. 667 ; but where property had been levied
on by attachment, and, pending the suit, the debtor assigned all
his property for the benefit of creditors, except such as he might
lawfully hold exempt from execution, it was held that the right
of the debtor to select the attached property as exempt from sale
was not thereby waived, 38 O. S. 530. Concealment of other
property does not prevent the right to select, 2 Clev. R. 129. The
original section 8, act 1850, did not contain the clause "to be
selected," etc. That clause was added bv the amendment of
1858; see 9 O. S. 590. By the act of 1809 the right to make the
selection was extended to the debtor's agent or attorney, and by
the act of 1873 (70 v. 51) the word " wife" was inserted, but under
the previous amendment (66 v. 48, 50) it was held that if the hus
band owned but a single article of personal property, and it was
of less value than $500, and was levied upon to satisfy his debt,
his wife was entitled to demand and have such article set off in
lieu of homestead, 28 O. S. 483; but it has been held that she
can not select as exempt from execution chattels upon which
her husband has given a mortgage to secure the judgment cred
itor for the debt on which the judgment is founded, 17 Bull 318 ;
see 3 O. S. 270, holding that in case of a pledge or chattel mort
gage the owner waives the benefit of exemption so far as the in
cumbrance extends. "Atanylimebeforesale." 4 Bull 986; see 10
Rec. 570 ; 2 Bull 127. The section applies as well to property
levied on by attachment as by execution, and an order for the
sale of the attached property made in the proceeding in attach
ment does not prevent the debtor from exercising his right of
selection after the making of such order of sale, 38 O. & 530.
Formerly the demand was to be made at the time of the levy, i W. L. M. 149; 3 O. S. 270: but if the debtor were not present, it
should be made, and notice given to the officer within a reason
able time before sale, 3 O. S. 270; but where lands were sold In
an action on ft mortgage executed by husband und wife, neither
of whom had a homestead, the wife, as against a judgment cred
itor who was a party, was held entitled to the exemption out
of the surplus after satisfaction of the mortgage debt, though no
demand was made until the sale was confirmed and the money
in the hands of the officer for distribution, 31 O. S. 447. By the
amendment (70 v. 51) the value of the property was to be ap
praised by householders selected by the officer, "and it was held
that as the statute made no provision for appeal or review, un
less fraud or collusion was charged, the appraisement was con
clusive between the parties, 3 Bull 569. "In addition to the
amount of chattel property otherwise by law exempted ; " own
ership of personal property does not prevent allowance, 2 Bull
127. Probate court can allow $500 in lieu of homestead to as
signor, 40 O. S. 631. Special exemptions : Notary public's seal

§ 5442. Homestead in property mortgaged by husband.
No sale of real estate made under a mortgage which is
not executed by the wife of the debtor, if he has a wife,
shall in any manner affect the right of the debtor's wife
or family to have a homestead set off under the pro
visions of this subdivision. [48 v. 29, § 9 ; S. & C. 1147.]
See I 543on.
§ 5443. Dower not affected. Nothing in this subdi
vision contained shall be so construed as in any way to
impair the righ*t of dower, or the mode provided by law
for enforcing that right. [48 v. 29, I 10; S. & C. 1147.]
SUBDIVISION IV. WHEN CHATTELS CLAIMED BY THIRD
PErsON.
§ 5444. Proceedings when goods levied on are claimed
by third person. If the officer, by virtue of a writ of
execution issued from any court of record of this state,
levy such execution on goods and chattels claimed by a
person other than the defendant, such officer shall forth
with give notice, in writing, to a justice of the peace of
the county, in which shall be set forth the names of
the plaintifff and defendant, together with the name of
the claimant, and at the same time furnish the justice
a schedule of the property claimed; the justice shall, im
mediately upon the receipt of the notice and schedule,
make an entry of the same upon his docket, and issue a
summons, directed to the sheriff, or any constable of the county, commanding him to summon five disinterested
men, having the qualifications of an elector, who shall
be named in the summons, to appear before him, at the
time and place therein mentioned, which time shall not
be more than three days after the date of the writ, to try
and determine the right of the claimant to the property
in controversy ; the claimant shall give two days' notice,
in writing, to the plaintifff, or other party for whose ben
efit the execution was issued and levied, his agent or
attorney, if within the county, of the time and place of
trial; and he shall, moreover, prove to the satisfaction of
the justice that such notice was given, or that it could
not be given by reason of the absence of the party, his
agent or attorney. [51 v. 57, § 426 ; S. & C. 1070.]
The officer can not institute this proceeding, 16 O. S. 420,
though it is designed mainly for his protection, 8 O. 370 ; 11 O. S,
527. 682. The claimant is not bound to proceed under the stat
ute ; he may sue the officer, 8 O. 370, but he must elect between
replevin and a suit for damages, 2 H. 36. If he fails on the trial,
he can not sue the officer, 8 O. 370. but if he succeeds he can, 4
O. S. 598. By resorting to this remedy the claimant waives con
stitutional objections. 12 O. S. 105. The finding on the trial is
not conclusive, except to protect the officer, 11 O. S. 527. A sale
by a constable of the property pending trial will not oust juris
diction of justice, and the cause may proceed though not termi
nated until after sale, 11 O. S. 682. A jury of five is constitu
tional, 16 O. S. 420. The provisions of this subdivision do not
apply to seizures by constables on executions issued by justices
of the peace, 11 O. S. 527 ; generally, 3C.C.R. 25,7.
§ 5445. Id. Trial of the right of property. The jurors,
summoned as aforesaid, shall be sworn to try and deter
mine the right of the claimant to the property in contro
versy, and a true verdict to give according to the evi
dence; if the jury find that the right to the goods and
chattels, or any part thereof, is in the claimant, they
shall also find the value thereof, and the justice shall
render judgment upon such finding for the claimant,
that he recover his costs against the plaintifff in execu
tion, or other party for whose benefit the execution issued,
and also that he have restitution of the goods and chat
tels, or any part thereof, according to the finding of the
jury ; but if the jury find that the right to the goods and
chattels, and every part thereof, is not in the claimant,
the justice shall render judgment on such finding in
favor of the plaintifff in execution, or other party for
whose benefit the execution issued, and against the claimant, for costs, and award execution thereon ; if the jury
fail to agree, and be discharged, costs shall be taxed, to
abide the final event of the proceeding before the justice,
and another jury shall be summoned in like manner as
before ; a judgment for the claimant, unless an under
taking be executed, as provided in the next section, shall
be a justification of the officer in returning "no goods"
to the writ of execution by virtue of which the levy was
made, as to such part of the goods and chattels as were
found to belong to the claimant; and the same fees shall
be allowed and taxed by the justice, for himself, officers,
jurors, and witnesses, as are allowed by law for like
services in other cases. [57 v. 31, \ 427 ; S. & C. 1071.]
§ 5446. Proceedings when jury find for plaintifff. If
the jnry find that the property, or any part thereof, is in
the claimant, and the plaintifff in execution, at any time
within three days after the trial, tender to the officer
having the property in his custody on execution an un
dertaking, in double the amount of the value of theproperty as assessed by the jury, with good and sufficient
sureties, payable to the claimant, to the effect that they
will pay all damages sustained by reason of the deten
tion or sale of the property, the officer shall deliver such
undertaking to the claimant, and proceed to sell the
property as if no trial of the right thereto had taken
place, and shall not be liable to the claimant therefore.
[51 v. 57, §428; S. & C. 1071.]
A sheriff is not liable to the successful claimant for selling the
chattels on the writ when the plaintifff in execution had tendered
a bond as provided for in this section, and the claimant refused
to receive it, 12 O. S. 105.
SUBDIVISION V. ExeCUTION AGAINST THE PERSON.
§ 5447. Requisites of execution against the person.
An execution against the person of the judgment debtor
shall require the officer to arrest such debtor, and com
mit him to the jail of the county until he pays the judg
ment, or is discharged according to law. [51 v. 57, § 477 ;
S. & C. 1091.]
A sheriff can not be amerced for not executing ft writ under
this section from another county, unless the indorsement " funds
deposited " is made upon the writ ; nor can a tender of his fees
be substituted in the place of such indorsement, 10 O. 46, because
the clerk of the county whence the writ issued was required to
indorse upon it " funds are deposited to pay the sheriff on this writ," and subscribe his name thereto, 29 v. 226. The imprison
ment of a judgment debtor upon execution operates as a satis
faction of the judgment so long as the imprisonment continues,
and so if he is discharged from such imprisonment with the as
sent of the execution creditor ; but if he escapes, or is discharged
without the absent of the creditor, it is not satisfaction of the
judgment, 19 O. 362.
§ 5448. For what causes execution against the person
may issue. An execution against the person of the debtor
may be issued upon any judgment for the payment of
money :
1. When the judgment debtor has removed, or begun
to remove, any of his property out of the jurisdiction of
the court, with intent to prevent the collection of the
money due on the judgment.
2. When he has property, rights in action, evi
dences of debt, or interest or stock in a corporation or
company, which he fraudulently conceals with the like
intent.
3. When he has assigned or disposed of all or part of
his property, or rights in action, or has converted the
same into money, with intent to defraud his creditors, or
with the intent to prevent such property from being
taken in execution.
4. When he fraudulently contracted the debt or in
curred the obligation upon which the judgment was ren
dered.
5. When the judgment was rendered for money, or
other valuable thing, lost by playing at any game, or
by means of any bet or wager.
6. When he was arrested on an order before judgment,
and has not been discharged as an insolvent debtor, or
the order has not been set aside as improperlv made.
[51 v. 57, 1 478 ; 54 v. 30, § 1 ; S. & C. 667, 1092.] "
§5449. By whom and how such execution allowed.
An execution against the person of the debtor, except as
prescribed in § 5451, can be issued only when allowed by
the supreme court, the district court, the court of com
mon pleas, or the probate court, or any judge of either,
upon being satisfied, by the affidavit of the judgment
creditor, or his attorney, and such other evidence as may
be presented, of the existence of one or more of the par
ticulars mentioned in the preceding section. [51 v. 57
§ 479 ; S. & C. 1092.]
"That the debtor is about to dispose of his property with
intent to deiraud his creditors," sufficient under 36 v. 75, 16
O. 301.
§ 5450. Id. Kay be issued by justice of the peace.
A justice of the peace may issue an execution against
the person of a judgment debtor, upon being satisfied of
the existence of one or more of the same particulars, by
like affidavit and evidence. [51 v. 57, §480; S. & C.
1092.]
§5451. Id. When issued of course. When the judg
ment debtor was arrested before judgment, and has not
been released from imprisonment by an application for
relief as an insolvent debtor, and the order for such
arrest has not been adjudged improper, an execution
against the person of such judgment debtor may issue
of course. [51 v. 57, § 481 ; S. & C. 1092.]
1 W. L. M. 350.
§ 5452. Discharge by delivery of property. A person
taken in execution as aforesaid shall be discharged by
delivering or setting off to the officer who serves the
writ, if issued from a court of record, real or personal
property, or if issued by a j ustice of the peace, personal
property only, sufficient to satisfy the judgment and
costs for which the writ was issued. [51 v. 57, ? 482 ;
S. & C. 1092.]
When the defendant turns out real estate to release his body,
the lien of the judgment on other lands of defendant is not
thereby discharged, 11 O. 42. Land surrendered, sold without
valuation, 2 O. 328 (act 1815).
§ 5453. Entitled to prison hounds, but execution may
issue against property. A person imprisoned under the
provisions of this subdivision shall be entitled to prison
bounds, as prescribed by law; but in case the person is
out of jail in prison bounds, the judgment creditor, upon
whose judgment he was imprisoned, shall be entitled to
execution against the lands and tenements, goods and
chattels, of the debtor, and all other remedies prescribed
by law for the collection of debts. [51 v. 57, § 483 ;
S. & C. 1092.]
§ 5454. Death of debtor no satisfaction of judgment.
The death of a person under arrest in an action shall
not satisfy the judgment; but an execution may issue
on the judgment as if no arrest had been made. [51 v.
57,? 484; S. & C. 1093.]
§ 5455. If arrested before judgment, debtor must be
charged in execution within ten days. If a person who
is imprisoned under an order of arrest made before judg
ment, be not chirged in execution within ten days after
judgment, he shall be discharged from such imprison
ment. [51 v. 57, 1 483 ; S. & C. 1093.]
§ 5456. When debtor may be discharged. A person
imprisoned under this subdivision, or upon an order of
arrest before judgment, in civil cases, who is unable to
perform the act, or endure the imprisonment, may be
discharged therefrom upon such terms as are just, by the
court out of which the process issued, or a judge thereof,
or by the court in which the judgment was or might
have been rendered, or a judge thereof. [51 v. 57, \ 486 ;
S. & C. 1093.]

which the process issued, at the cost of the party who
sued out the process. [29 v. 341, \ 10 ; S. & C. 84.]
§ 5462. Prison bounds fixed. A person imprisoned for
debt shall be entitled to the privilege of prison bounds,
which shall be co-extensive with the limits of the
county ; but such prisoner shall not, in any instance,
pass over or without such limits. [29 v. 340, § 1 ; 31 v. 11,
?1; S. & C. 1210, 1211.]
§ 5463. When prisoner entitled to benefit of prison
bounds. A prisoner shall not be entitled to the privilege
of prison bounds until he gives bond to the creditors,
with two or more sureties, resident in the county, ap
proved by the justice or mayor who issued the process,
or, in other cases, by the probate judge, in double the
sum for which he stands committed, for his safe contin
uance in the custody of the jailer, within the limits of
the prison bounds, until legally discharged, which bond
shall be lodged with the sheriff until the creditor de
mands the same ; and when the condition of the bond is
broken, the creditor may put the bond in suit, and have
judgment entered against the sureties for the debt, inter
est, and costs for which the prisoner stands committed.
[29 v. 340, §2; S. & C. 1210.]
Joint bonds given in separate suits are void ; and a bond is
void unless defendant is actually in prison, and that fact is re
cited in the bond, 2 O. 277. It is a good defense to an action on
a bond given under this section that no order was made by the
court or judge authorizing its issue, or that such order was
made without the necessary preliminary proof, or that the writ
has been quashed, 15 O. 372. A certificate given by a commis
sioner of insolvents to a debtor who has given bond for the
prison limits, discharges the security on the bond, notwithstand
ing the proceedings are afterwards dismissed in the common
pleas, 9 O. 100. Creditor must support prisoner, 1 O. 32; 2
Bull 264.
CHAPTER II.
ProceedinGs in Aid of ExecUTion,
subdivision i. by civil Action.
§ 5464. When judgment creditor may proceed against
equitable assets, etc When a judgment debtor has not
personal or real property subject to levy on execution
sufficient to satisfy the judgment, any equitable interest
which he has in real estate, as mortgagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, or any interest he has in any hanking, turn
pike, bridge, or other joint stock company, or in any
money contract, claim, or choses in action ;1), due or to
become due to him, or in any judgment or order, or
any money, goods, or effects which he has in the posses
sion of any person, or body politic or corporate, shall
be subject to the payment of the judgment, bv action.
[51 v. 57, ? 458 ; S. & C. 1086.]
1. 3 C. C. R. 98. Insufficient answer, 21 Bull 313.
A proceeding under this section is in the nature of a creditor's
bill, 18 O. S. 24. If assignment for creditors is fraudulent, prop
erty is liable, 5 O. 293. Bonds of railroad company unissued can
not be subjected, 2 D. 46,",: nor debts of county, 18 O. 13. Prop
erty of different defendants can be reached in the same bill, 11 O.
292. Right to dower is liable, 5 Bull. 410 ; 41 O. S. 540. Earning*
for three months exempted, 25 O. S. 516. Issuance and return of
execution not essential iffact thatjudgment debtor has no property
subject to levy and sale is averred, 2 O. 294 ; 6 O. 227 ; 16 O. 317 ;
13 O. S. 263. Foreign land is not liable, 1 D. 550. Fraudutent con
ceyance set aside at suit of creditor, 18 O. 444 ; 29 O. S. 597.
Joinder of actions and parties : a cause of action to recover a
money judgment, and one in the nature of a creditor's bill to
obtain satisfaction of judgment, can not be united, 1 W. L. M.
571; nor a claim against a corporation alleged to be insolvent
with a prayer against stockholders indebted to the corporation
for arrears of subscription, 1 H. 281; but a judgment creditor of
an insolvent railroad corporation may join in the same action a
claim to compel payment of unpaid subscriptions for stock and
a claim to enforce the individual liability of stockholders for
the satisfaction of his judgment, 20 O. S. 190. Plaintiff can not,
in a suit against a defendant on a contract to recover money,
join debtors of defendant and seek to subject their debts to the
payment of his judgment when recovered, 1 H. 217. Judgment
must first be obtained, unless there is a charge or lien, 1 H. 281;
24 O. S. 432; 16 O. 317. When a judgment upon which an action
was based to subject a debt due the judgment debtor was set
aside at a subsequent term for irregularity, and re entered, and
a supplemental petition based uoon the latter judgment was
filed, the proceeding was lis pendens, and did not authorize the
debtor of the judgment debtor to pay him his debt, 10 O. S. 30",.
A justice of the peace has no jurisdiction to subject choses in
action belonging to judgment debtor to payment of judgment, 1
H. 557. The Superior Court of Cincinnati and common pleas have
jurisdiction, though the judgment is less than one hundred dol
lars, Id. Permanent teasetloUl mortgageli can only be reached by
this proceeding, HO. 355. Possession by license not liable, 3 O.
292. Judgment creditor acquires no lien in equity upon choses
in action of debtor until bill is filed, 6 O. 156; 4 O. S. 62:!;
obtains preference by filing bill, 13 O. 197. Money can be sub
jected, 1 W. L. M. 143 (but not money in the hands of a person
not summoned, 2 Clev. R. 185); and mortgagor's interest without
tender of money due to mortgagee, 17 O. 336. Partnership prop
erty must be first exhausted before action can be maintained to
subject monies owned by one partner to pay partnership debt,
3 O. 287. In action to collect judgment due firm, not necessary to allege that firm was formed for or doing business in Ohio, in
averring rendition of judgment in favor of firm, 13 O. S. 210.
Pteading must show that judgment is recovered and that there
is no real or personal property sufficient to satisfy debt. 3 O. 287 ;
16 O. 318. Averment of return of "no goods" insufficient, 1 D.
159 ; 8 O. 217. Salaries of city officers may be subjected, 15 O. S.
462; and stockholders' subscriptions, 17 O. 187. No action lies
against state to compel payment stock subscription, 11 O. 273.
Sureties against whom judgment is had may subject credits of
principal to payment of judgment without first paying the debt,
1 O. 533 ; 4 O. S. 600. Trust fund. Interest payable to A for life,
with remainder to his heirs, is liable, 2 H. 78. Vend&r's lien for
unpaid purchase money subject, 21 O. S. 402. Form, 11 O. 292.
§ 5465. Proceedings in aid by garnishment against
railroad company. The plaintifff, or his agent or attor
ney, in a judgment against a railroad company, rendered
in any court, upon a claim due to common laborers for
work and labor performed for the company, or for crossties, lumber, or wood furnished thereto, to be used in
the construction, repair, or operation of its road, or for
the erection of fences along the line of its road, required
by law to be erected, or upon a note, or other evidence
of indebtedness, given for the considerations aforesaid,
may file with a precipe for execution upon such judg
ment his affidavit, setting forth the claim upon which
the judgment is founded, that he has no knowledge of
any property of the defendant liable to levy and sale
upon the execution, and that a person or corporation, to
be therein named, and within the jurisdiction of the
officer to whom the execution is to be directed, is in
debted to the defendant, or has property or claims of
the defendant in his possession or under his control, as
agent of the defendant, or otherwise; and thereupon
the clerk shall issue a notice to each person or corpora
tion named, to the effect that he is required to pay over
and deliver, to the officer holding such writ, the money,
property, and claims of the defendant, in his possession
or under his control, or which may come into his posses
sion or under his control at any time before the satis
faction of the judgment, not exceeding an amount suffi
cient to pay the same and costs. [63 v. 126, § 1 ; S. & S.
119.]
§ 5466. Id. Kotice to garnishee. The officer shall serve upon each garnishee named in the notice a copy of
the execution and notice, and the person so served shall
be bound to the plaintifff in execution, from the date of
such service, for all the money, property, and credits of

officer within his township competent to administer
oaths, or before the clerk of the court of common pleas
of his county, and answer such questions as may be
asked him touching the property of every description,
money, and credits of the defendant, in his possession or
under his control; the notice shall be signed by the
plaintifff, or his agent or attorney, shall specify the time
when and place where the examination will be held, and
shall be served at least one day before the day fixed for
the examination ; the examination shall be reduced to
writing, signed by the garnishee, certified by the officer
before whom it was taken, and filed with the papers in
the case ; and the garnishee shall be entitled to the same
fees for attendance as are allowed to witnesses. [57 v.
119, § 3 ; S. & C. 1174.]
§ 5468. Id. Attachment against garnishee on failure
to appear or refusal to answer. If the garnishee refuse to
appear, as required by the notice, an attachment may be
issued against him, upon proof made of due service of
the notice ; or if, having appeared, he refuse to answer
such questions as are asked him as aforesaid, the officer
before whom the examination is being had shall commit
him to the jail of the county until he answers such ques
tions, or is discharged according to law. [57 v. 119, § 4;
S. & C. 1174.]
§ 5469. Id. Garnishee to deliver money and property
to officer. The garnishee shall pay over to the officer all
money in his hands, or under his control, or which may
come into his hands or control, belonging to the defend
ant, not exceeding the amount of the judgment and costs,
and deliver to the officer all property and credits of the defendant in his hands, or which may come into his
hands, and take his receipt for such money, property, or
credits, which receipt shall be a sufficient discharge of
liability therefore; and upon refusal by such garnishee
to pay over or deliver as aforesaid, the plaintifff may com
mence an action therefore, in his own name, against the
garnishee, and recover the same, with costs. [57 v. 120,
§5; S. &C. 1174.]
§ 5470. Id, Officer to sell property. The officer shall
sell, as upon execution, any property of the defendant so
delivered to him which would be liable to seizure and sale
upon execution, and shall hold all the other property
to abide the order of the court. [57 v. 120, I 6 ; S. & C.
1174.]
§ 5471. Id. When assignments void. An assignment
or transfer of property, in the hands or under the control
of any agent of such railroad company at the date of
the service of notice of garnishment, or which may after
wards, and before the satisfaction of the judgment, come
into his hands or under his control, shall be void as
against judgment claimants under this subdivision. [57
v. 120, § 7 ; S. & C. 1174.]
SUBDIVISION m. BY EXAMINATION OF DEBTOR.
§ 5472. Examination of debtor after return of execu
tion. When an execution against the property of a
judgment debtor, or one of several debtors in the same
judgment, issued to the sheriff of the county where he
resides, or if he does not reside in the state, to the sheriff
of the county where the judgment was rendered, or a
transcript of a justice's judgment has been filed, is re

creditor shall be entitled to an order from a probate
judge, or a judge of the court of common pleas, of the
county to which the execution was issued, requiring such
debtor to appear and answer concerning his property be
fore such judge, or a referree appointed by such judge, at
a time and place within the county to be specified in
the order. [51 v. 57, \ 459 ; S. & C. 1089.]
Superior Court of Cincinnati has no jurisdiction, 9 Bull 241.
Court has power to order examination of other witnesses than
judgment debtor when satisfied on application of party that ad
ditional witnesses should be examined, 11 Bull 144; see 1 Clev.
K. 26.
§ 5473. Examination of debtor before return of execu
tion. After the issue of an execution against property,
and upon proof by the affidavit of the judgment creditor,
or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court of common
pleas, or a judge thereof, or a probate judge, of the
county in which the debtor is found, that the judgment
debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply
toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such court or
judge may, by order, require the judgment debtor to
appear at a time and place, in such county, to answer
concerning the same ; and such proceedings may there
upon be had, for the application of the property of the
judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judg
ment, as are prescribed in this subdivision. [51 v. 57,
2460; S.& C. 1089.]
Demand on debtor not required, 11 O. S. 323.
§ 5474. When order of arrest may issue, and proceed
ings therecn. Instead of the order requiring the attend
ance of the judgment debtor, as provided in the two
preceding sections, the judge may, upon proof, in writ
ing, to his satisfaction, by affidavit of the judgment
creditor, or otherwise, that there is danger of the debtor
leaving the state, or concealing himself, to avoid the
examination herein mentioned, issue a warrant requir
ing the sheriff to arrest and bring before him the debtor ;
such warrant can be issued only by a judge of the court
of common pleas, or the probate judge, of a county in
which the debtor is found, and the sheriff can execute it
only within that county ; in executing the warrant the
sheriff shall deliver to the debtor a copy thereof, and of
the testimony on which it issued ; the debtor, when
brought before the judge, shall be examined on oath,
and other witnesses may be examined on either side; if

before the judge or referee for examination, from time
to time, as shall be directed ; and in default of entering
into such undertaking, he may be committed to the jail
of the county, by warrant of the judge, as for contempt.
[51 v. 57, 1 461 ; S. & C. 1089.]
§ 5475. Examination of debtor of judgment debtor.
Effect of such order. Notice to parties. After the re
turn pf an execution against the property of a judgment
debtor, or of one of several debtors in the same judgment,
and upon proof, in writing, by affidavit, or otherwise, to

tion from the time of service ; and the person or corpo
ration so served with the order shall be liable to the
judgment creditor for all property, money, and credits
in his hands belonging to the judgment debtor, or due
to him from such person or corporation, froiu the time
of service; but if, on the filing of the affidavit of the
judgment creditor, his agent or attorney, the judge is
satisfied of the existence of any of the grounds upon
which an order of attachment may be issued, as pro
vided in § 5521, the order may be issued before the issue
and return of execution ; and the judge may also require
notice of such proceeding to be given to any party in
the action, in such manner as may seem to him proper.
[71 v. 53, 1 464.]
Debtor of execution debtor can not. after service of order,
discharge himself by payment to execution debtor of his in
debtedness, 6 O. S. 255. Examination of debtor not subject to
review, 1LO. S. 569. Judgment in such proceedings against
judgment, debtor and his debtor, ordering the latter to pay the
amount due from him to judgment creditor, protects him from
suit on same demand by judgment debtor ; effect of reversal of.
judgment in original case, 2 0. C. R. 77.
§ 5476. Person not excused from answering because
examination may oonvict him of fraud. No person shall,
on examination pursuant to this subdivision, be excused
from answering any question on the ground that his ex
amination will tend to convict him of a fraud; but his
answer shall not be used as evidence against him in a
prosecution for such fraud. [51 v. 57, § 462 ; S. & C. 1089.]
This section does not apply to a civil action based on discoveries made in such proceedings in the probate court, and
brought for the purpose of applying upon a judgment property
subject to such application, 40 O. S. 345.
§ 6477. Reference by judge to referee. The judge
may, in his discretion, order a reference to a referee
agreed upon, or appointed by hint, to report the evi
dence or the facts. [51 v. 57, § 472 ; S. & C. 1091.]
Testimony before referee may be used as a deposition in the
case, 8 Rec. 364. Refusal to confirm referee's finding not subject
to review, 2 Clev. R. 185.
§ 5478. Proceedings may be continued. The judge or
referee, acting under the provisions of this chapter, may
continue his proceedings from time to time, until they
are completed. [51 v. 57, § 471 ; S. & C. 1091.]
ji 5479. Attendance of parties and witnesses enforoed.
A party or witness may be compelled, by an order of the
judge, or by a subpoena, to attend before a judge or ref
eree, to testify. [51 v. 57, \l 465, 466 ; S. & C. 1090.]
Attendance enforced only by order of judge, 1 Clev. R. 26;
see 11 Bull 144.
§ 5480, Examination before referee to be certified.
Oath. If before a referee, the examination must be
taken by the referee, and certified to the judge; all ex
aminations and answers before a judge or referee must
be on oath ; and when a corporation answers, the answer
must be on the oath of an officer thereof. [51 v. 57,
§ 466 ; S. & C. 1090.]
See | 5213.
§ 5481. How disobedience of order punished. If a per
son, party, or witness disobey an order of the judge,
court, or referee, duly served, he may be punished as for
contempt; and such referee may, at his discretion, re
port the case to the court, or judge, and such court or
judge may punish for contempt as provided in chapter
4, division 7, title 1, of the Revised Statutes of Ohio.
[59 v. 48, 1 473; S. & S. 566; 86 v. 48.]
There is no power under this section, or any other, to imprison
for refusal to obey the order where the person having possession
Gf the money claims to own it, 42 O. S. Ill, 112; see 4 Bull 733.
§ 5482. Debtor may pay execution against creditor.
After the issue of execution against property, a person
indebted to the judgment debtor may pay to the sheriff
the amount of his debt, or so much thereof as may be
necessary to satisfy the execution ; and the sheriff's re
ceipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the amount so paid, or directed to be credited by the judgment creditor
on the execution. [51 v. 57, I 463 ; S. & C. 1089.]
And the same rule applies to an execution held by a constable
and issued by a justice of the peace, 15 O. S. 176.
§ 5483. Judge may order property to be applied on
execution. The judge may order any property of the
judgment debtor, or money due to him, not exempt by
law, in the hands either of himself or other person, or
of a corporation, to be applied toward the satisfaction
of the judgment; but the earnings of the debtor for his
personal services, at any time within three months next
preceding the order, can not be so applied, when it is
made to appear, by the affidavit of the debtor, or other
wise, that such earnings are necessary for the use of a
family supported wholly or partly by his labor. [51 v. 57,
§ 467 ; S. & C. 1090.]
The mode of applying property under this section is not pre
scribed, but it must be in analogy as to claims of the debtor
against third persons, to the remedies to which the debtor him
self might resort. The court, or judge, is not, under this sec
tion, authorized to settle disputes between the debtor and a third
person, or to enforce the collection of claims by order of pay
ment and attachment. Where claims are to be collected, the
appointment of a receiver ia the proper course, 11 O. S. 323. A
judge can not, under this section, enforce the payment of a debt,
in the absence of all fraud, by imprisonment, as for a contempt,
but may direct the applica tion of the proceeds of the debt, when
collected by a receiver or otherwise, 6 O. S. 255. Earnings of
debtor, etc., exempt; see 25 O. S. 516. See § 5430, subdivision 6n.
§ 5484. Judge may appoint receiver, and prohibit trans
fer, etc., of property. The judge may, by order, appoint
the sheriff of the proper county, or other suitable per
son, a receiver of the property of the judgment debtor;
and he may also, by order, forbid a transfer, or other dis
position of, or any interference with, the property of the
judgment debtor not exempt by law. [51 v. 57, § 468 ;
S. & C. 1090.]
§5485. Liability of sheriff on official bond. If the
sheriff be appointed receiver, he and his sureties shall be
liable on his official bond as such receiver; and if another
person be appointed, he shall take an oath and give an
undertaking as in other cases. [51 v. 57, § 470 ; S. & C.
1091.]
§ 5486. Proceedings when another has an ascertainable
interest in the property. Sale of debtor's interest. If it
appear that the judgment debtor has an interest in real
estate, in the county in which proceedings are had, as
mortgagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, and his interest can
be ascertained as between himself and the person hold
ing the legal estate, or the person having a lien on or
interest in the same, without controversy as to the inter
est of such person holding such legal estate, or interest
therein, or lien on the same, the receiver may be ordered
to sell and convey such real estate, or the interest of the
debtor therein ; such sale shall be conducted, in all re
spects, in the same manner as is provided for the sale of
real estate upon execution ; and the proceedings of all
sales shall, before the execution of the deed, be approved
by the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the
transcript filed. [51 v. 57, § 469 ; S. & C. 1090.]
§ 5487. Orders, etc, to be signed by judge, filed with
clerk, and minute made on execution docket. The order
mentioned in 5472, 5473, and 5475, shall be in writing,
and signed by the judge who makes the same, and shall
be served as a summons; and the judge shall reduce all
his orders to writing, which, together with a minute of
his proceedings, signed by himself, shall be filed with the
clerk of the court of the county in which the judgment
is rendered, or the transcript of the justice is filed, and
the clerk shall enter on his execution docket the time of
filing the same. [51 v. 57, § 474 ; S. & C. 1091.]
No record is required, but the judge must file his "orders"
and a "minute of his proceedings" with the clerk, who alone
can certify transcripts thereof, 1 W. L. M. 87.
§ 5488. Compensation of probate judge. The probate
judge shall be allowed for his services under this subdi
vision the sum of three dollars in each case, and such
fees as are allowed by law to clerks of the court of com
mon pleas for similar services. [51 v. 57, § 470 ; S. & C.
1091.]
§5489. Costs. The judge shall allow to clerks, sher
iffs, referees, receivers, and witnesses, such compensation
as is allowed for like services in other cases, to be taxed
as costs in the case, and shall enforce by order the col
lection thereof, from such party or parties as ought to
pay the same. [51 v. 57, § 475 ; S. & C. 1091.
The judge is authorized to order the costs to be paid by such
party as ought to pay the same, 1 W. L. M. 87.
§ 5490. When enforced by attachment. When the
judgment is not for the recovery of money or real prop
erty it may be enforced by attachment, by the court
which rendered the same, upon motion made, or by a
rule of the court upon the defendant ; but in either case
notice of the motion, or a service of a copy of the rule,
shall be made on the defendant a reasonable time before
the order of attachment is made. [51 v. 57, § 488 ;
S. & C. 1093.]
§5491. Arrest in civil actions only as prescribed by
this title. A defendant in a civil action can be arrested
before judgment in the manner prescribed by this title,
and not otherwise ; but this provision shall not apply to
proceedings for contempt, nor to actions prosecuted or
judgments obtained in the name of the state of Ohio to
recover fines or penalties. [51 v. 57, \ 145 ; S. & C. 991.]
§5492. By whom and when order of arrest may be
made. An order for the arrest of the defendant shall be
made by the clerk of the court in which the action is
brought, when there is filed in his office an affidavit of
the plaintifff, his authorized agent or attorney, made be
fore a judge or clerk of any court of the state, or a jus
tice of the peace, stating the nature of the plaintifff's
claim, that it is just, and the amount thereof, as nearly
as may be, and establishing one or more of the following
particulars :
1. That the defendant has removed, or begun to re
move, any of his property out of the jurisdiction of the
court with intent io defraud his creditors.
2. That he has begun to convert his property, or a part
thereof, into money, for the purpose of placing it beyond
the reach of his creditors.
3. That he has property, or rights of action, which he
fraudulently conceals.
4. That he has assigned, removed, disposed of, or begun
to dispose of, his property, or a part thereof, with intent
to defraud his creditors.
5. That he fraudulently contracted the debt, or in
curred the obligation, for which suit is about to be or
has been brought.
6. That the money, or other valuable thing, for which
a recovery is sought in the action, was lost by playing at
any game, or by means of a bet or wager.
The affidavit shall also contain a statement of the
facts claimed to justify the belief in the existence of one
or more of such particulars. [51 v. 57, § 146 ; 54 v. 30,
§ 1 ; S. & C. 667, 991.]
See I 6483. The statute must be strictly construed, 14 O. S.
213. The affidavit must state the amount of the debt with
certainty, 10 O. 263; but if plaintifff does not know the precise
amount he should say " as nearly as he is able to state, and
which amount named is not greater than the amount justly due
him from the said defendant," Yaple'sPr. etc. 89. The amount
sworn to in the affidavit must be indorsed on the writ, 10 O. 263,
but not the amount for which the defendant is held to bail, 16 O.
304. Affidavit under former statute, that defendant is about to
move, without stating facts from which the inference is drawn,
insufficient, 2W. L. J. 42H.
4. An affidavit in the words of the act 1838, that the debtor is
"about to dispose of his property with intent to defraud his
creditors," sufficient, 16 O. 304.
5. An affidavit that plaintifff's brokers sold his stocks under
his direction, received the money, stating the amount over and
above all charges, and embezzled and converted the same to
their own use. sufficient, 44 O. S. 636.
An order based on an affidavit which does not contain a state
ment of the facts claimed to justify the affiant's belief is void, for
want of legal authority in a justice to issue it, and an arrest un
der it is illegal, 14 O. S. 213.
§ 5493. Id. Not to be issued unless bond given, The
order of arrest shall not be issued by the clerk until there
is executed, by sufficient sureties of the plaintifff, a writ
ten undertaking, to the effect that the plaintifff shall pay
to the defendant all damages, not exceeding double the
amount of the plaintifff's claim stated in the affidavit,
which he may sustain by reason of the arrest if the order
prove to have been wrongfully obtained. [51 v. 57,
§ 147; S. &C. 992.]
§ 5494. When it may issue. The order may be made
to accompany the summons, or at any time afterward,
before judgment. [51 v. 57, ? 148 ; S. & C. 992.]
§ 6495. To whom delivered, and oontents. It shall
be addressed, and delivered, with a copy of the affidavit, to the sheriff, and shall specify the names of the parties,
the court in which the action is brought, and the amount
of the plaintifff's claim stated in the affidavit, and shall
require the sheriff to arrest the defendant, and hold him
iu bail in double that sum, and to make return of the
order on a day to be named therein, with the under
taking of the bail, if any be given. [51 v. 57, § 149;
S. & C. 992.]
Insertion of mere initial letters of plaintifff's Christian name
is a fatal defect in the description of the person, 10 O. 263. A writ
describing the plaintifff as Brazilla Smith instead of Barzilla
Smith, and designating justice of the peace, J. P., held sufficient,
7 O. (Pt. 2) 236.
§ 5496. When order of arrest returnable. The return
day of the order of arrest, when the order is issued at the
commencement of the suit, shall be the same as that of
the summons ; and when issued afterward, it shall be
fifteen days after it issued. [51 v. 57, § 150 ; S. & C. 992.]
(5 5497. How executed. The sheriff shall execute
the order by arresting the defendant, and delivering to
him a copy thereof, and of the affidavit ; and if the de
fendant can not be found before the return day, the
plaintifff may have further orders, without other affidavit
or undertaking, until the defendant is arrested ; but an
order of arrest shall not be issued to any other than the
county in which the action is brought. [51 v. 57, § 151 ;
S. & C. 992.]
§ 5498. Commitment of defendant to jail. The defend
ant, when arrested, shall be committed to the jail of the
county, and kept in custody until discharged by law.
[51 v. 57, §152; S. & C. 992.]
The imprisonment of the debtor operates as a satisfaction so
long as the imprisonment continues, or if he is discharged with
the assent of the creditor, the discharge operates as a satisfaction,
otherwise if he escape or is discharged without the creditor's
assent, 19 O. 362.
§ 5499. Defendant may deposit money and be dis
charged. The defendant may, before or after giving
bail, deposit with the sheriff, or in court, the amount of
money specified in the order of arrest; whereupon he
shall be discharged, or his bail, if any has been given,
shall be released. [51 v. 57, § 153 ; S. & C. 993.]
§ 5500. Money deposited to be paid into court. The
sheriff shall pay into court the money received by him in lieu of bail; and if it be received in vacation, he
shall pay it on the first day of the next term, and if re
ceived during the terra, he shall pay it immediately. [51
v. 57J154; S. & C. 993.]
§ 5501. Court to have control of money. The court
shall make proper orders for the safe-keeping of money
deposited in lieu of bail, and may direct the sheriff to
keep the same, and, after final judgment in the action,
shall order it to be paid to the party entitled thereto, ac
cording to the result. [51 v. 57, § 155 ; S. & C. 993.]
§ 5502. Sheriff and sureties liable for the money.
Money so deposited with the sheriff, or directed by the
court to be kept by him, shall be held upon his official
responsibility; and he and his sureties shall be liable,
and may be proceeded against, for any default in relation
thereto, as in other cases of delinquency. [51 v. 57,
§156; S. &C. 993.]
§ 5503. When and how bail to be taken. Bail may be
given by the defendant on his arrest, or at any time
afterward, before judgment; it shall be done by causing
sufficient bail to execute a written undertaking to the
plaintifff, in the presence of the sheriff, to the effect that,
if judgment be rendered in the action against the defend
ant, he will render himself amenable to the process of the
court thereon ; and the undertaking, when accepted, shall
be returned to the clerk's office, and the defendant shall
be discharged. [51 v. 57, § 157 ; S. & C. 993.]
Bail discharged by judgment for defendant, though afterward
reversed, 20 O. S. 567.
§ 5504. Plaintiff may object to bail. The plaintifff, or
his attorney, may object to the bail for insufficiency, at
any time within ten days after the undertaking is given,
by serving upon the sheriff a written notice that he does
not accept the bail ; a failure to serve such notice shall
be deemed an acceptance of the bail, and the sheriff shall
be exonerated from liability ; and when the undertaking
is given after the return of the order of arrest, the plaintifff
shall have notice thereof. [51 v. 57, ? 158; S. & 0. 994.]
§ 6505. Notice ofjustification. The sheriff, or the de
fendant, may, within ten days after the receipt of such
notice, give to the plaintifff, or his attorney, notice in
writing of the justification of the same or other bail be
fore a judge or clerk of the court in which the action is brought, a probate judge, or a justice of the peace, at a
time, not less than five nor more than ten days thereafter,
and a place, to be specified therein ; and if other bail be
given, a new undertaking must be executed. [51 v. 57,
§ 159 ; S. & C. 994.]
§ 5506, Manner of justification. For the purpose of
justification, each of the bail must attend Defore the
proper officer, at the time and place mentioned, and
may be examined on oath touching his sufficiency, in
such manner as the officer deems proper. [51 v. 57,
§ 160; S. & C. 994.]
§ 5507. Allowance of bail. If the officer find the bail
sufficient, he shall indorse his allowance on the under
taking, and cause it to be filed with the clerk ; and the
sheriff shall thereupon be discharged from liability.
[51 v. 57, ? 161 ; S. & C. 994.]
§ 5508. When sheriff liable as hail and how dis
charged. If, after the arrest of the defendant, he escape,
or be rescued, or bail be not taken or be adjudged
insufficient, or a deposit be not made, the sheriff shall
be liable as bail; but he may discharge himself from
liability by putting in sufficient bail at any time before
judgment. [51 v. 57, § 162; S. & C. 994.]
Insufficiency of jail no defense, 13 O. S. 177 ; nor privilege of
prisoner from arrest, 13 O. S. 182.
§ 5509. Liability of sheriff, how fixed. The return of
" not found," upon an execution against the body of the
defendant, shall be necessary to fix the liability of the
sheriff as bail, which liability shall be the amount of
the judgment, interest, and costs; and this liability can
be enforced only in a separate action against him, or
against him and his sureties on his official bond, as in
other cases of delinquency. [51 v. 57, § 163 ; S. & C. 994J
§ 5510. Bail adjudged insufficient liable to sheriff.
The bail adjudged insufficient shall be liable to the
sheriff for the damages he may sustain by reason of
such insufficiency. [51 v. 57, § 164; S. & C. 994.]
§ 5511. Liability of bail, how fixed. The liability of
the bail shall be fixed in the manner provided in \ 5509
for fixing the liability of the sheriff as bail ; and the
bail can be proceeded against in an action only. [51 v.
57,3 165; S. & C. 994.]
§ 5512. Surrender of defendant a disoharge of hail. A
\I 5513-5515
surrender of the defendant to the sheriff of the county
in which he was arrested, with a delivery of a certified
copy of the undertaking of the hail, whether such sur
render is made by the defendant himself, or by his bail,
shall discharge the bail ; such surrender may be made
at any time before the return day of the summons in an
action against the bail ; the sheriff shall give to the bail
a written acknowledgment of the surrender, and hold
the defendant in his custody, upon such copy of the
undertaking of the bail, as upon an order of arrest ; and
the clerk of the court shall, on the production to him
of the sheriff s acknowledgment of the surrender, enter
on the undertaking an exoneration of the bail. [51 v.
hi, §166; S.&C.994.]
After their liability is fixed, bail can not surrender defendant
and be discharged, 7 O. S. 514; but in an action on the bond,
the court has power, at any time before judgment, to grant bail
iurther time in which to surrender the judgment debtor, 35 O. S.
131.
§ 5513. Bail may arrest defendant. The bail may, for
the purpose of surrendering the defendant, arrest him
at any time or place before he is finally charged, or, by
a written authority indorsed on a certified copy of the
undertaking, may empower any person of suitable age
and discretion to do so. [51 v. 57, § 167 ; S. &. C. 995.]
§ 5514. For what causes bail may be exonerated. The
bail shall be exonerated by the death of the defendant, or
by his imprisonment in a state prison, or by his legal dis
charge from the obligation to render himself amenable
to the process of the court, or by his surrender to the
sheriff of the county in which he was arrested in the
execution of such process, within the time fixed in
-? 5512, or within such further time as the court in which
the action is pending may allow. [51 v. 57, § 168 ; S. & C.
995.]
§ 5515. Bail may be substituted for a deposit of money.
If money be deposited by the defendant, as provided iu
§ 5499, bail may be given and justified, upon notice as
prescribed in \ 5505, at any time before judgment; and
thereupon the court in which the action is brought, on
being satisfied that the bail has been given and adjudged
sufficient, shall direct that the money deposited be re
funded to the defendant, and it must be refunded accord
ingly. [77 v. 43 ; 51 v. 57, § 169 ; S. & C. 995.]
§ 5516. When, proceedings against bail may be stayed
and bail discharged. If, at any time before or after
judgment against the bail, proceedings in error be com
menced on the judgment against the principal, in the
suit in which their undertaking was taken, the court
may, on motion, stay proceedings against such bail for
a reasonable time, on payment by them of all costs that
have accrued against them ; and if, on such proceedings,
the judgment against the principal be reversed, and the
principal be discharged from such suit, the bail shall be
discharged from the undertaking. [51 v. 57, §170;
S. & C. 996.]
§ 5517. Mode of vacating order of arrest or reducing
amount of bail. A defendant who is arrested may, on
motion, at any time before judgment in the action, apply
to the court in which suit is brought, if in session,
and, in vacation, to a judge thereof, or to any judge of a
court of record of the state, to vacate the order of arrest,
or to reduce the amount of the bail ; and the court or
judge shall allow to him such time for preparation, and
the hearing of the motion, as is just and reasonable ; but
reasonable notice of such motion must be given to the
plaintifff. [64 v. 10, § 171 ; 8. & S. 544.]
§ 5518. Motion may be supported and opposed by affi
davits. When the motion is made upon affidavits on
the part of the defendant, but not otherwise, the plaintifff
may oppose the same by affidavits, or other evidence, in
addition to the evidence on which the order of arrest
was made. [51 v. 57, § 172 ; S. & C. 996.]
§ 5519. Jail fees, how paid. A p ,rson who causes an
other to be committed to jail under the provisions of this
chapter shall be liable, in the first instance, for the jail
fees, and shall, if required by the jailer, pay such fees
weekly in advance ; and the fees so paid shall be a part
of the costs of the case. [51 v. 57, § 173; S. & C. 996.]
This section has no application to a case of imprisonment of
a defendant, by order of court, after conviction under the bas
tardy act, 13 O. S. 43. Fees not exceeding fifty cents per day, § 1235.
§ 5520. When sheriff may discharge prisoner. The
sheriff or jailer may discharge a person imprisoned
on mesne or final process issued in a civil proceeding, at
any time when there is no money in his hands to pay for
the sustenance of such prisoner; or, he may detain the prisoner, and hold the adverse party liable for such sus
tenance. [51 v. 179, I 168 ; S. & C. 799.]
Sheriff or jailer may permit the prisoner to go nt large, if, on
demand, the judgment creditor does not pay the jail foes weekly
in advance, 13 O. S. 182. Neither the sherilt' nor county commis
sioners are bound to feed an insolvent prisoner in jail, <i O. 439.
§ 5521. Grounds of attachment. In a civil action for
the recovery of money, the plaintifff may, at or after the
commencement thereof, have an attachment against the
property of the defendant, upon the grounds herein stated :
1. When the defendant, or one of several defendants, is
a foreign corporation, or a non-resident of this state; or,
2. Has absconded, with the intent to defraud his cred
itors; or,
3. Has left the county of his residence, to avoid the
service of a summons; or,
4. So conceals himself that a summons can not be
served upon him ; or,
5. Is about to remove his property, or a part thereof,
out of the jurisdiction of the court, with the intent to
defraud his creditors ; or,
6. Is about to convert his property, or a part thereof,
into money, for the purpose of placing it beyond the
reach of his creditors ; or,
7. Has property, or rights in action, which he con
ceals: or,
8. Has assigned, removed, disposed of, or is about to
dispose of, his property, or a part thereof, with the in
tent to defraud his creditors; or,
9. Has fraudulently or criminally contracted the debt,
or incurred the obligation, for which suit is about to be
or has been brought.
But an attachment shall not be granted on the ground
that the defendant is a foreign corporation, or a non
resident of this state, for any claim other than a debt or
demand arising upon contract, judgment, or decree, or
for causing death by a negligent or wrongful act. [62 v.
10, \ 191 ; S. & S. 549.]
An attachment did not lie against the property of a married
woman in an action to charge her separate estate, in which no
personal money judgment could be rendered against her, 24 O.
S. 389. It lies against a husband for partnership debts of hus
band and wife, Id 87. An attachment can not issue until peti
tion is filed, 35 O.S.661.
1. Foreign corporation. Non-resident. The words " foreign cor
poration" in the justice'scode, 1853, did not include a corporation
created by the laws of this state, and located therein, 12 O. S. 139.
Non-resident. Attachment lies against a non-residentstockholder
in Ohio corporation, 21 O. S. 221 ; by one partner against another
non-resident partner after dissolution, 12 O. S. 165; by surety, on
behalf of creditor, against principal debtor, for a debt past due,
on the ground of non-residence, 2 D. 436; before debt due, see 11
O.S.579; 12O.S.158. Jurisdiction is acquired againsta non-resi
dent by the issuing of process, based upon the requisite affidavit,
and the attachment of the property, 15O.436; 17O.409; see2D.
168; but where the property is sought to be reached by process
of garnishment only, the answer of the garnishee that he is not
indebted, and has no property in his possession belonging to the
defendant, does not oust the court of jurisdiction, 31 O. S. 537;
29 O. S. 120. If: after thus acquiring jurisdiction, the court pro
ceed to render judgment without the publication of notice, such
judgment is not void, and can not be collaterally impeached,
but must be reversed on error, 1§ O. 436. By demurring to the
petition, a non-resident brings himself as fully within the juris
diction of the court as if he had been served with summons in
the action, 29 O. S. 120. An affidavit in attachment, stating as
the sole ground for the attachment that the defendant is a "non
resident of the county," made before a justice of the peace, in a
case subsequently certified to the common pleas, under § 6514, is
not sufficient to authorize the issuing of an order of attachment
in the common pleas, 26 O. S. 529. L nder the act of 1810, a for
eign attachment could not be sustained against one of several
joint and several contractors, 4 O. 132 ; and under the act of 1824,
an attachment could not be sustained against one of several con
tractors who was a resident of the state when the others were
non-residents, 4 O. 150.
2. "Has absconded with the intent to defraud his creditors." Where
one partner absconds and the other disposes of a part, and is dis
posing of the whole, of the partnership effects, it will be presumed
that they intend to delay and hinder their creditors so as to form
a good ground of attaciimen t against the partnership property,
1 H. 87.
4. " So conceals himself that a summons can not be serced upon
him." See 2 Bull 86 (I 0489). The fact that a summons is issued
and returned " not found " has no tendency to show that the de
fendant is concealing himself with intent to evade process, and,
on the other hand, that intent may appear clearly from other
facts, Id.
8. Has assigned his property with the intent to defraud his credit
ors. An attachment on this ground will be set aside where the
sole evidence to support it is a conveyance, which, if fraudulent
at all, is so only by construction of law under the provisions of
the statute of frauds, and it is shown affirmatively that, even if,
in its consequences as to creditors, the conveyance be fraudulent,
such consequences were not in fact contemplated or intended.
8 Rec. 744 ; see 3 W. L. G. 281. The fact of a conveyance alone,
when defendant was insolvent, will not justify an attachment,
though it might justify a bill in chancery to set aside the con
veyance, 4 Bull 1064. Intentional fraud must be proven, 1
C. C. R 7fi.
9. " Hal fraudutentty," 22 O. S. 388, " or criminalty contracted the
debt." In cases of assault and battery, 22 O. S. Ill, 115: 31 O. S.
57. The fraudulent conversion of promissory notes, bills of ex
change, etc., does not create "an obligation fraudulently in
curred," 1 \i. 469. An obligation fraudulently incurred is no
ground for attachment unless it is an obligation by contract, Id.
" But an attachment shall not be granted on the ground that the
defendant is a foreign corporation, or a non-resident of this state,
for any claim other than a debt or demand arising upon con
tract, judgment, or decree, etc.," 24 O. S. 4sl ; and an amendment
of the petition and a Itidavit, showing a cause of action arising
on contract, will not give jurisdiction without the issuance of an
attachment after the amendment, Id. A contract for agent's
commissions comes within the rule, 2 Bull 94, and the implied
contract of a common carrier to protect passengers from injury,
31 O. S. 537, but not an action for breach of promise to marry,
2 Bull 4.
SUBDIVISION II. HOW ATTACHMENT OBTAINED.
§ 5522. Bequisites of affidavit for attachment. An or
der of attachment shall be made by the clerk of the court
in which the action is brought, in any case mentioned in
the preceding section, when there is filed in his office an
affidavit of the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, showing:
1. The nature of the plaintifff's claim;
2. That it is just;
3. The amount which the affiant believes the plaintifff
ought to recover ; and
4. The existence of any one of the grounds for an
attachment enumerated in the preceding section. [51 v.
57, I 192; S.&C. 1003.]
A writ of attachment without the requisite affidavit is void,
33 O. S. 254. The affidavit need not show that affiant is agent, 3
W. L. J. 131 ; see 15 Bull 359 ; nor why it was made by attorney,
29 O. S. 423. Affidavit alleging ground of attachment in the dis
junctive is insufficient, 1 11. 48; 1 D. 1 ; see 9 ti. S. 3S8 ; 7 Bull
334, as that defendant " fraudulently or criminally " contracted
the debt, 13 Bull 35, for the words " fraudulently" and "crim
inally" are not synonymous, 22 O. S. 114; 31 O. S. 57. An affi
davit in the language of the statute is sufficient, 12 O. S. 335; 9
O. S. 397 ; and if the court think proper to act upon an affidavit
stating the ground for attachment substantially in the language
of the statute, it is not proper cause for reversal on error, 9 O. S.
388. It is not indispensable that the affidavit contain the exact
words of the statute, provided it contains language fully equiv
alent, or clearly showing the ground specified or intended, 31
O. S. 57. An affidavit is sufficient if it states positively the
amount due upon plaintifff's claim, instead of showing the
amount which he " believes the plaintifff ought to recover," 21
O. S. 82. An affidavit stating that plaintifff believes that defend
ant had absconded, with intent to defraud his creditors, with
out setting forth facts justifying such belief, is insufficient, 17
O. S. 640; and an affidavit merely setting forth the belief of
plaintifff, or his agent, that the debt for which the action is
brought was fraudulently contracted, without stating any facts
on which the belief is founded, is insufficient, 23 O. S. 192. The
affidavit and order for attachment constitute no part of the plead
ings, and the grounds for the attachment should not be stated
in the petition, 9 O. S. 388 ; 33 O. S. 254; but averments in the
petition may, by express reference, be incorporated in the affi
davit, 16 Bull 398. if the omission of a separate affidavit can be
cured by a showing in the petition, it should contain all the
requisites of an independent affidavit, and be duly verified ; and
where the petition, treated as an affidavit, does not show that
the claim sued on is just, nor state the amount the affiant be
lieves he ought to recover, and is verified upon belief merely, it
is insufficient to cure the omission of a separate affidavit, 33
O. S. 254. The proper mode for defendant to meet the charge
made in the affidavit is by motion, 9 O. S. 388. Leave given to
amend affidavit, see 1 Bull 334.
§5523. When undertaking required. When the ground
of the attachment is that the defendant is a foreign cor
poration, or a non-resident of this state, the order of at
tachment may be issued without an undertaking ; but in
all other cases the order shall not be issued by the clerk
until there is executed in his office, by sufficient surety
of the plaintifff, to be approved by the clerk, an under
taking, in a sum equal to double the amount of the
plaintifff's claim, to the effect that the plaintifff shall pay
the defendant all damages which he may sustain by
reason of the attachment if the order prove to have been
wrongfully obtained. [51 v. 57, § 193 ; S. & C. 1004.]
Failure to give the undertaking is a mere irregularity, of
which defendant in attachment can alone take advantage, 19
O. ti. 296. Want of a seal does not affect its validity, 37 O. S."484 ;
nor the omission of the name of the surety in the body of the
instrument, Id.; see 38 O. S. 375. Leave to sue is not necessary,
§ 11.515. An action on an undertaking given to A and B may
be prosecuted in their names as partners where It appears that
the injury was the wrongful seizure of property owned by them
as partners, 23 O. S. 358. It is sufficient to aver In the petition
that the attachment was wrongfully obtained, but it is not
necessary to state that the attachment was sued out without
probable cause ; it must appear, however, that the attachment
has been dismissed by the court, or abandoned by the plaintifff,
1 H. 515. An action on such undertaking may be prosecuted by
those obligeeswho have an interest in the damages sought to be
recovered, without making other obligees, who have no interest
in the action, parties, 23 O. S. 358 In such action it is not nec
essary to aver or prove that the attachment has been discharged
as to those obligors who are not necessary parties to the action.
Id. The recovery should be limited to such damages as defend
ant in attachment may have suffered from being deprived of his
property, its loss, destruction, or deterioration, with the costs
and expenses he has incurred in the defense of the original suit,
1 H. 515. Interruption to business, caused by wrongful seizure
and detention of stock of goods kept for sale by retail, is an ele
ment of damage, 23 O. S. 358. Compensation in such cases in
cludes reasonable costs and expenses incurred in procuring the
discharge of the attachment and the restoration of the attached
property. Damages supposed to result by reason of injury to
reputation of goods by the lew can not be recovered, Id. The
execution of a redelivery bond, under § 5529, is no bar to the
action, 23 O S. 358. An action upon the undertaking does not
preclude defendant from instituting another suit for malicious
prosecution, 1 H. 515.
*
§ 5524. Order of attachment ; to whom directed, and
its command. The order of attachment shall be di
rected and delivered to the sheriff, and shall require
him to attach the lands, tenements, goods, chattels,
stocks, or interest in stocks, rights, credits, money, and
effects of the defendant, in his county, not exempt by
law from being applied to the payment of plaintifff's
claim, or so much thereof as will satisfy the plaintifff's
claim, to be stated in the order as in the affidavit, and
the probable costs of the action, not exceeding fifty
dollars. [51 v. 57, \ 194; S. & C. 1004.]
Equitable interests are subject to attachment, 14 O. S. 457; see
1 H. 153; 2 id. 202. Grantor's interest in land conveyed by de
fective and unrecorded deed, 15 O. 435. Mortgagor's interest in
chattel property, 14 O. S. 457 ; see 18 O. S. 184. Interest of part
ner, 1 H. 22. Stock, 21 O. S. 221; and when pledged before serv
ice of attachment, attachment reaches surplus after payment of
debt, 43 O. S. SOD; hut defendant's property, after assignment,
can not be attached, 2 H. 101 ; nor property in the hands of an
officer, unless he is proceeded against as garnishee, 19 O. S. 587 ;
21 O. S. 142; nor evidences of debt, 2 H. 202; nor debtor's earn
ings for three months preceding levy, when necessary for the
support of his family, 25 O. S. 516. Bona fide purchaser of land
attached without notice of equity takes a good title, 15 O. 435;
16 O. S. 440; see 9 O. 108. Partnership, 2 C. C. R.110.
§ 5525. Orders of attachment may issue to different
oounties. Orders of attachment may be issued to the
sheriffs of different counties; and several of them may,
at the option of the plaintifff, be issued at the same time,
or in succession ; but such only as have been executed
shall be taxed in the costs, unless otherwise directed by
the court. [51 v. 57, § 195 ; S. & C. 1005.]
Under this section the city is to be considered as a county,
2 H. 2(M ; see 21 Bull 122.
§ 5526. When order of attachment returnable. The
return day of the order of attachment, when the order
is issued at the commencement of the action, shall be the
same as that of the summons ; and when issued after
ward, it shall be twenty days after it issued. [51 v. 57,
§ 196; S.&C. 1005.]
SUBDIVISION III. EXECUTION AND RETURN.
§ 5527. When several orders issue. Order of execu
tion. When there are several orders of attachment
against the same defendant, they shall be executed in the
order in which they were received by the sheriff. [51 v.
57, §197; S.&C. 1005.]
Issuing of general execution is no waiver of priority of attach
ment, O. S. 94.
§ 5528. How order executed. The sheriff shall exe
cute the order of attachment without delay ; he shall go
to the place where the defendant's property is, and there,
in the presence of two freeholders of the county, declare
that, by virtue of the order, he attaches the property at
thesuitof the plaintifff (1) ; the officer, with the freehold
ers, who shall be first sworn by the officer, shall make a
true inventory and appraisement (2) of all the property
attached, which shall be signed by the officer and free
holders, and returned with the order; when the property
attached is real property, the officer shall leave with the
occupant thereof, or, if there is no occupant, in a con
spicuous place thereon, a copy of the order; and when
it is personal property, and can be come at (3), he shall
take it into his custody, and hold it subject to the order
of the court. [51 v. 57, 1 198 ; S. & C. 1005.]
1. The duty of the officer to attach the property in the pres
ence of two freeholders ("two credible persons") is directory,
and not imperative; if omitted, the levy may be set aside at the
instance of the defendant, but is binding on third parties, and
is well performed if the declaration is made in the presence of
persons casually present, 1 D. 40.5, § 6493. 2. Under the law
of 1805 the omission of the sheriff to sign the inventory and ap
praisement was held a mere irregularity that did not affect the
validity of the proceedings, 7 O. iPt. 1) 257. 3. The expression,
when the property ''can be come at," refers to the nature and
position of the property, and not to the character of the title and
interest of the owner, lit. 23. Sufficiency of levy, 45 O. S. 222.
§ 5529. When property attached may be delivered to
the persons with whom found. The sheriff shall deliver
the property attached to the person in whose possession
it was found, upon the execution by such person, in the
presence of the sheriff, of an undertaking to the plaintifff,
with sufficient surety, resident in the county, to the
effect that the parties to the same are bound, in double
the appraised value of the property, that the property,
or its appraised value in money, shall be forthcoming to
answer the judgment of the court in the action ; but if
it appear to the court that any part of such property has
been lost or destroyed by unavoidable accident, the value
thereof shall be remitted to the person so bound. [51 v.
57, §199; S.&C.1005]
The action must be brought in the court where the attach
ment issued. 2 P. 73. Several attaching creditors may join in the
action; their several rights, 10 O. S. 478. Under § 5528 it is the
interest of the defendant that is to be appraised, and the penalty
of the bond under this section will only be double that interest,
and not double the value of the whole property attached, if part
nership property, 1 H. 22. The undertaking to perform the judg
ment of the court in the action has reference to the final order
and direction of the court in that case, and does not -necessarily
intend payment or delivery directly to the plaintifff in attach
ment, 2 D. 73. The undertaking is valid though no appraise
ment is had, and the security is approved by the sheriff instead
of the court, 1 W. L. M. 42. The execution of the redelivery
bond is no bar to an action on the attachment undertaking, 23
O. S. 358 ; see 24 Kas, 580 ; 3C.C.R. 432 ; 45 O. S. 222.
§5530, Proceedings against garnishee. Service. When
the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, makes oath, in writ
ing, that he has good reason to believe, and does believe,
that any person, partnership, or corporation, in the affi
davit named, has property of the defendant in his pos
session, describing the same, if the officer can not get
possession of such property, he shall leave with such
garnishee a copy of the order of attachment, with a writ
ten notice that he appear in court and answer, as pro
vided in § 5547 ; and it the garnishee does not reside in
the county in which the order of attachment was issued,
the process may be served by the proper officer of the
county in which the garnishee resides, or may be person
ally served. [78 v. 93 ; 74 v. 160, ? 200.]
" Any person " includes a guardian, 9 Bull 64 ; " corporation,"
a foreign railroad company, 31 O. S. 537. A corporation may at
tach the interest of its own stockholder by service of process
upon itself, 43 O. S. 509. " Partnership " may be garnished in
its firm name, 18 O. S. 134 (so held before the word "partner
ship" was added to the statute by the last amendment); but a
debt due to a firm can not be garnished to pay claim against a
partner, 29 O. S. 120. Amount due on a promissory note can not
be garnished, 34 O. S. 15a ; nor can money in the hands of admin
istrator before order of distribution, 5 Bull 288; see 45 O. S. 653.
§ 5531. Effect of service of process of garnishment on
public officer. The service of process of garnishment
upon the sheriff, coroner, clerk, constable, master com
missioner, marshal of a municipal corporation, or other
officer having in his possession any money, claim, or other
property of the defendant, or in which the defendant has
an interest, shall bind the same from the time of such
service, and shall be a legal excuse to such officers, to the
extent of the demand of the plaintifff, for not paying
such money or delivering such claim or property to the
defendant, as by law, or the terms of the process in his
hands, he would otherwise be bound to do. [74 v. 160,
§ 200.]
In order to attach property held by an officer under legal pro
cess, he must be proceeded against as a garnishee ; it is not suf
ficient, in order to bind the" officer or the property, that he be
merely notified by the officer holding the writ of attachment
that he holds the same, and by virtue of it attaches the property,
19 O. S. 587. Under a former statute it was held that mouey re
ceived by a sheriff on execution could not be attached in his
hands, 1 O. 275.
§ 5532. Where garnishee to answer and be examined.
The answer of the garnishee shall be made before the
clerk of the court of common pleas of the county in
which he resides, or, if he resides out of the state, before
the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county
where he was served, or where the action is pending; a
special examination of the garnishee shall be had ; and
actions against him under § 5551 shall be brought in the
county in which he resides. [74 v. 160, \ 200.]
Garnishee should aver readiness to pay, 2 Clev. R. 97; may
object to action against foreign firm in firm name, 2 Bull, 97;
may set up as a good defense attachment in another state, 25
O. S. 347, or former garnishment, 2 Bull 94; but not payment by
his wife in his absence, 25 O. S. 320 ; nor a right of exemption in
the defendant, Id., though tho defendant may be made a party
and claim the exemption, 30 O. S. 545. His answer does not dis
charge him. but leaves him liable to be sued by plaintifff, 29 O. S.
120: 31 O. S. 537. Court may appoint commissioner to examine
garnishee, 18 O. S. 134 ; see 45 (i. S. 653.
§ 5533. Clerk to transmit answer to proper court. The
clerk of the court of common pleas before whom the
answer is made, shall transmit the same to the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending, in the same man
ner as depositions are required to be directed and trans
mitted, and shall receive for his services such fees as are
allowed by law for taking depositions, and to clerks for
furnishing certificates, with their seals of office attached ;
and if the garnishee admit an indebtedness to the defend
ant, and the court order the payment of the same, or any
part thereof, to the plaintifff, and the garnishee fail to
order, execution may
issue thereor. as upon judgments for the payment of
money. [74 v. 160, § 20U.]
Under the justice's code the order of the justice is not a judg
ment charging the garnishee, and can only be enforced by action
against him, 39 O. S. 218, and not by execution, as under this sec
tion ; see 12 O. S. 358, 359 ; 2 D. 86 ; 2 H. 1.
§ 5534. How garnishee served. If the garnishee is a
person, the copy of the order and notice shall be served
upon him personally, or left at his usual place of resi
dence ; if a partnership garnisheed by its company name,
they shall be left at its usual place of doing business (1),
and if a corporation they shall be left with the presi
dent or other principal officer, or the secretary, cashier,
or managing agent (2) thereof; and if such corporation
is a railroad company, they may be left with any regu
lar ticket or freight agent thereof, in any county in
which the railroad is located (3). [78 v. 93; 65 v. 213,
§ 201 ; S. & S. 552.]
1. 18 O. S. 134. 2. A foreign insurance company may be made
a garnishee by serving copies of the order of attachment and
notice upon the managing agent of such company, 15 Bull 333,
distinguishing 2 D. 1, where an attempt was made to serve an
insurance company located in Cleveland by delivering a copy of
the order of attachment to an agent in Cincinnati, and it was
held that the only proper mode to serve the company would be
by an order of attachment issued to Cuyahoga County. 3. For
eign railroad company operating in this state served in the same
manner as a domestic corporation, 31 O. S. 537.
§ 5535. Different attachments on same property made
by same officer. Different attachments of the same prop
erty may be made by the same officer ; and one inventory
and appraisement shall be sufficient, and it shall not be
necessary to return the same with more than one order.
[51 v. 57, § 202 ; S. & C. 1006.]
Subsequent attaching creditors can not be made parties be
cause of interest in the attached property, and can not rely on informalities or irregularities in the proceedings, 9 O. S. 388; 12
O. S. 158; and where an equity of redemption is attached, the
mortgagee is not a proper party, 33 O. y. 254.
§ 5536. How subsequent attachments made. When
the property is under attachment, attachments on the
same under subsequent orders shall be as follows :
1. If it is real property, it shall be attached in the
manner prescribed in § 5528.
§ 2. If it is personal property, it shall be attached as in
the hands of the officer, and subject to any previous at
tachment.
3. If a person be made a garnishee more than once
with respect to the same indebtedness or liability, a copy
of the order and notice shall be left with him, in the man
ner prescribed in § 5530. [51 v. 57, § 203 ; S. & C. 1 006.]
§ 5537. Form of return. The officer shall return upon
every order of attachment what he h is done under it,
and the return must show the property attached, and the
time it was attached ; when garnishees are served, their
names, and the time each was served, must be stated ; and
the officer shall return with the order all undertakings
given under it. [51 v. 57, § 204 ; S. & C. 1006.]
The return should show that the property attached belonged
to defendant, 13 O. 209, 219; it is conclusive as between parties
and privies of facts stated, until set aside, and as to third per
sons prima facie evidence of such facts, 14 O. S. 240 ; it may be
amended, but not to affect prior levies or liens, 13 O. 220, and an
amendment only operates against third persous from its date, Id.
§ 5538. When property and garnishee bound. An order
of attachment shall bind the property attached from the
time of service ; and the garnishee shall stand liable to
the plaintifff in attachment for all property of the de
fendant in his hands, and money and credits due from
him to the defendant, from the time he is served with
the written notice mentioned in § 5530 (1); but when
property is attached in the hands of a consignee, his
lien thereon shall not be affected by the attachment (2).
51 v. 57, § 205 ; S. & C. 1006.]
1. 21 O. S. 221. Levy of order of attachment, without process
of garnishment, has no greater operation than levy of execution,
38 O. S. 70. Garnishee not necessarily exempt from liability to
pay interest on indebtedness to defendant in attachment during
the pendency of the proceedings, 9 O. H. 452. 2. Assignee of cer
tificate of deposit preferred to attaching creditor, 11 O. 8 449and pledgee of bank stock, 43 O. S. 509 ; mortgagee of personal
§ 5539. Receiver may be appointed. The court, or a
judge thereof in vacation, may, on the application of
the plaintifff, and on good cause shown, appoint a receiver,
who shall take an oath, and give an undertaking, as is
provided in other cases. [51 v. 57, § 206 ; S. & C. 1007.]
§ 5540. Duties and powers of receiver. The receiver
shall take possession of all notes, due bills, books of ac
count, accounts, and all other evidences of debt, that
have been taken by the sheriff or other officer as the
property of the defendant in attachment, and shall pro
ceed to settle and collect the same, and for that purpose
he may commence and maintain actions in his own
name, as such receiver; but in such actions no right of
defense shall be impaired or affected. [51 v. 57, §207;
S.-&C. 1007.]
In case an order of attachment is sent to another county, and
evidences of indebtedness are there taken, a receiver appointed
here may take possession of such evidences of indebtedness, and
proceed to collect them as in any other case, 2 H. 204.
§ 5541. Notice of receiver's appointment. The receiver
shall forthwith give notice of his appointment to the
persons indebted to the defendant in attachment, which
notice shall be written or printed, and shall be served
on the debtor by copy personally, or by copy left at his
residence ; and, from the date of such service, the debt
ors shall stand liable to the plaintifff in attachment for
the amount of money and credits of the defendant in
attachment in their hands, or due from them to him, and
shall account therefore to the receiver. [51 v. 57, § 208 ;
S. & C. 1007.]
§ 5542. Report of receiver. The receiver shall, when
required, report his proceedings to the court, and hold
all money collected by him, and property which may
come into his hands, subject to the order of the court.
[51 v. 57, §209; S. & C. 1007.]
§ 5543. When attaching officer to act as receiver,
When a receiver is not appointed, the officer who at
taches the property shall have all the powers, and per
form all the duties, of a receiver appointed by the court
or a judge, and may, if necessary, commence and maintain actions in his own name, as such officer; and he
may be required to give security other than his official
undertaking. [51 v. 57, § 210 ; S. & C. 1007.]
§ 5544. How attached property disposed of. The court,
or a judge thereof in vacation, may make proper orders
for the preservation of the property during the pendency
of the suit, and may direct a sale of property when, be
cause of its perishable nature, or the cost of keeping it,
a sale will be for the benefit of the parties ; the sale shall
be public, after such advertisement as is prescribed for
the sale of like property on execution, and shall be made
in such manner, and upon such terms of credit, with
security, as the court or judge, having regard to the
probable duration of the action, may direct; and the
sheriff shall hold and pay over all proceeds of the sale
collected by him, and all money received by him from
garnishees, under the same requirements and responsi
bilities of himself and sureties as are provided in respect
to money deposited in lieu of bail. [51 v. 57, § 211.]
Pending error application made to court where property
attached, 21 Bull 413.
Costs and expenses of storage, or for other care of property,
are a proper charge on the fund arising from the sheriff's sale of
the property. There is no provision authorizing a personal judg
ment against the plaintifff for the amount ot such expenses,
1 D. 571.
SUBDIVISION V. PROCEEDINGS UPON ATTACHMENT.
§ 5545. How attachment discharged. If the defend
ant, or other person on his behalf, at any time before
judgment, cause an undertaking to be executed to the
plaintifff', by sufficient surety resident in the county, to
be approved by the court, in double the amount of the
plaintifff 's claim as stated in his affidavit, to the effect
that the defendant shall perform the judgment of the
court, the attachment shall be discharged, and restitu
tion made of any property taken under it, or the pro
ceeds thereof ; and such undertaking shall also discharge
the liability of a garnishee in the action, for any prop
erty of the defendant in his hands. [51 v. 57, \ 212;
S. & C. 1008.]
The undertaking supersedes all proceedings under the at
tachment, and a garnishee who had been served with process,
and answered after the undertaking had been given, should, on
application of defendant, be discharged, 2'J 0. S. 120. The de
fendant in attachment can not ask the discharge of the garnishees on the ground that their answer fails to show that they
have property of the defendant in their hands subject to gar
nishment. The plaintifff is not concluded by the answer of the.
garnishees, and if the disclosures in their answer are not satis
factory to him he is authorized to proceed against them by
action on that ground, Id. ; sec 3 C. i '. R. 209.
§ 5546. Id. Undertaking may be given in vacation.
The undertaking mentioned in the preceding section
may, in vacation, be executed in the presence of the
officer having the order of attachment in his hands, or,
after the return of the order, before the clerk, with the
same effect as if executed in court, the sureties, in either
case, to be approved by the officer before whom the un
dertaking is executed. [51 v. 57, § 213 ; S. & C. 1008.]
15 O. S. 200.
§ 5547. Garnishee shall appear and make disclosure.
The garnishee, if the order of attachment be returned
during a term of court, and twenty days before the close
thereof, shall appear at that term, and if the order be
returned during vacation, he shall appear at the term
next after its return ; and he shall answer, under oath,
all questions put to him touching the property of every
description, and credits, of the defendant, in his posses
sion or under his control, and he shall disclose, truly,
the amount owing by him to the defendant, whether due
or not, and, in the case of a corporation, any stock
therein held by or for the benefit of the defendant, at
or after the service of notice. [51 v. 57, \ 214; S. & C.
1008.]
"In the case of a corporation, any stock," etc.; see 43 O. S.
509, 522.
§ 5548. Garnishee may pay money into court or to at
taching officer. A garnishee may pay the money owing
to the defendant by him to the officer having the order of
attachment, or into court; he shall be discharged from
liability to the defendant for any money so paid, not
exceeding the plaintifff's claim, and shall not be sub
jected to costs beyond those caused by his resistance of
the claim against him ; and if he disclose the property
in his hands, or the true amount owing by him, and de
liver or pay the same according to the order of the
court; he shall be allowed his costs. [51 v. 57, \ 215 ;
S. & C. 1008.]
§ 5549. Attachment of garnishee for contempt on fail
ure to answer. If the garnishee fail to appear in court
and answer, as required by \ 5547, the court may pro
ceed against him by attachment as for a contempt. [51
v. 57, §216; S.&C. 1008.]
ji 5550. Disposition of property in hands of garnishee.
If the garnishee appear and answer, and it be discov
ered on his examination, that at or after the service of
the order of attachment and notice upon him, he was
possessed of any property of the defendant, and was in
debted to him, or either, the court may order the delivery
of such property, and the payment of the amount owing
by him, into court, or either; or the court may per
mit the garnishee to retain the property, or the amount
owing, upon the execution of an undertaking to the
plaintifff, by sufficient surety, to the effect that the amount
shall be paid, or the property forthcoming, as the court
may direct. [51 v. 57, \ 217 ; S. & C. 1008.]
An order will not be made requiring the garnishee to pay the
current weekly wages of the delendant not due at the time of
the service of the attachment, but which became due afterward ;
luuch less subsequent wages paid in advance by the garnishee
to the defendant as the only condition on which he would con
tinue in his employment, '1 D. 87.
§ 5551. When plaintifff may have action against the gar.
nishee. If the garnishee fail to appear and answer, or
if he appear and answer, and his disclosure be not sat
isfactory to the plaintifff, or if he fail to comply with the
order of the court to deliver the property and pay the
money owing into court, or to give the undertaking re
quired in the last section, the plaintifff may proceed
against him by civil action ; and thereupon such pro
ceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment
may be rendered in favor of the plaintifff for the amount
of property and credits of every kind of the defendant
in possession of the garnishee, and for what may appear
to be owing by him to the defendant, and for the costs of
the proceedings against the garnishee. [51 v. 57, § 218 ;
S. & C. 1009.]
The right of action against a garnishee, under this section,
passes by an assignment of the judgment obtained against the
defendant in attachment, 18 O. S. 134 (see 5 Bull 441). An action
under this section to enforce against a partnership a liability
arising under its provisions may be brought against the partner
ship, either in the name of the firm or in the names of the persons who compose it, 18 O. S. 134. Plaintiff can not have an action
under this section when the court did not have jurisdiction of
the deiendant in attachment, 24 O. S. 481 ; and plaintifff can not
have an action against the garnishee on the ground of non-res
idence, though the garnishee may appear and answer, 26 O. S.
645 ; see, generally, 2 C. S. C. R. 56.
§ 5552. When plaintifff to pay costs, and defendant
may be substituted for plaintifff. If the plaintifff pro
ceed against the garnishee by action, for the cause that
his disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appear in the
action that such disclosure was incomplete, he shall pay
costs of such action ; and when the claim of the plaint
iff in attachment is satisfied, the defendant may, on
motion, be substituted as the plaintifff in the judgment.
[51 v. 57, § 218 ; S. & C. 1009.]
§5553. When judgment may be rendered against gar
nishee, and when he must be discharged. Final judg
ment shall not be rendered against the garnishee until
the action against the defendant in attachment is deter
mined (1); if in such action judgment be rendered for
the defendant in attachment, the garnishee shall be dis
charged, and recover costs ; and if the plaintifff recover
against the defendant in attachment, and the garnishee
deliver up all the property and credits of the defendant
in his possession, and pay all the money due from him,
as the court may order, the garnishee shall be discharged,
and the costs of proceedings against him shall be paid out
of the property and money so surrendered, or as the court
deems right and proper. [51 v. 57, § 219 ; S. & C. 1009.]
1. 2 H. 1 ; see § 5545n. Entering it before only a clerical error,
13 O. S. 219.
§5554. Effect of judgment for defendant. If judg
ment in the action be rendered for the defendant, the
attachment shall be discharged, and the property at
tached, or its proceeds, shall be returned to him. [51
v. 57, §220; S.&C. 1009.]
§ 5555. Proceedings after judgment for plaintifff. If
judgment be rendered for the plai ntiff, it shall be satis
fied as follows : So much of the property remaining in
the hands of the officer, after applying the money aris
ing from the sale of perishable property, and so much
of the personal property, and lands and tenements, if
any, whether held by legal or equitable title, as may be
necessary to satisfy the judgment, shall be sold by order of the court, under the same restrictions and regulations
as if the same had been levied on by execution ; and the
money arising therefrom, with the amount which may
be recovered from the garnishee, shall be applied to sat
isfy the judgment and costs ; if there be not enough to
satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand, and execution
may issue thereon for the residue, in all respects as in
other cases ; and any surplus of the attached property,
or its proceeds, shall be returned to the defendant. [51
v. 57, ?221; S.&C. 1009.]
§ 5556. Court may enforoe delivery of property attached
by proceedings for oontempt. The court may compel the
delivery to the sheriff, for sale, of any of the attached
property for which an undertaking has been given, and
may proceed summarily on such undertaking to enforce
the delivery of the property, or the payment of the
money due upon the undertaking, by rules and attach
ment as in cases of contempt. [51 v. 57, \ 222 ; S. & C.
1010.]
§ 5357. Court may order officer to repossess himself
of attached property. The court may order the officer to
repossess himself, for the purpose of selling it, of any of
the attached property which has passed out of his hands
without having been sold or converted into money ; and
the officer shall, under such order, have the same power
to take the property as he would have under an order of
attachment. [51 v. 57, \ 223 ; S. & C. 1010.]
§ 5558. When property attached is olaimed by a third
person, If personal property which has been attached
be claimed by any person other than the defendant, the
officer shall have the validity of such claim tried; and
such proceedings must be had thereon, with the like ef
fect, as if the property had been seized upon execution,
and claimed by a third person, [51 v. 57, \ 224 ; S. & C.
1010.]
See U 5444-5446nn.
§ 5559. When question of priority may be referred.
When several attachments are executed on the same
property, or the same person is made a garnishee by sev
eral parties, the court, on the motion of any of the
plaintifffs may order a reference to ascertain and report
the amounts and priorities of the several attachments.

§ 5560. Proceedings not to terminate by death of de
fendant. From the time of the issue of the order of at
tachment the court shall be deemed to have acquired
jurisdiction (1), and to have control, of all subsequent
proceedings under this chapter; and if, after the issue
of the order, the defendant, being a person, die, or being
a corporation, its charter expire by limitation, forfeit
ure, or otherwise, the proceedings shall be carried on ;
but in all such cases-, other than where the defendant
was a foreign corporation, the legal representatives of
the defendant shali be made parties to the action. [51
v. 57, 1 226 ; S. & C. 1010.]"
1. 41 O. S. 271, 272.
§ 5561. When plaintifff may be required to give further
security. The defendant may, at any time before judg
ment, after reasonable notice to the plaintifff, move the
court for additional security on the part of the plaintifff;
and if, on such motion, the court is satisfied that the
surety in the plaintifff's undertaking has removed from
the state, or is not sufficient for the amount of the under
taking, it may vacate the order of attachment, and direct
restitution of any property taken under it, unless, in a
reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, sufficient secu
rity be given by the plaintifff. [51 v. 57, § 227 ; «. & C.
1010.]
§ 5562. Motion to discharge attachment. The defend
ant may, at any time before judgment, upon reasonable
notice to the plaintifff, move to discharge an attachment,
as to the whole or any of the property attached ; and the
motion may be heard and decided by the court at any
term or regular session thereof, or it may be made,
heard, and decided by any judge thereof in vacation.
[54 v. 29, § 228 ; S. & C. 1011.]
Defendant in attachment can not move the court to dismiss
theettachment on the ground that the property attached does
not belong to him, 10 O. is. 439; and an attachment will not be
discharged on the ground that it appears from the answer of the
garnishee that he is not indebted, and has no property in his
possession belonging to the defendant, HI O. S. 537. On motion
to discharge an attachment for insufficient affidavit, the court
will not look into the petition and exhibits, 1 if. 45. On the
hearing of a motion to discharge an attachment issued on an in
sufficient affidavit, it is not competent for the plaintifff, in the
absence of leave to amend, or a motion for such leave, to suppleraent the affidavit or validate his proceedings by new affida
vits Khowing the existence of fraud in fact, 23 O. S. 192. The
proper mode for defendant to meet the charge made in an affi
davit for attachment is by motion, 9 O. S. 388 ; see 19 Bull 257.
§ 5563. Evidence on motion to discharge. When the
motion is made upon affidavits on the part of the de
fendant, or papers and evidence in the case, but not
otherwise, the plaintifff may oppose the same by affida
vits or other evidence, in addition to the evidence on
which the order of attachment was made. [51 v. 57,
§ 229 ; S. & C. 1011.]
See 2 D. 394 ; 34 O. S. 11; 20 Bull 388 ; 46 O. S.
.
§ 5563a, Party affected by order may file petition in
error. A party to a suit affected by an order discharg
ing or refusing to discharge an order of attachment,
may file a petition in error to reverse, vacate, or modify
the same, as in other cases ; and the original action shall
proceed to trial and j udgment in every respect, as though
no petition in error had been prosecuted. [77 v. 69.]
An order discharging an attachment is a final order, review
able on error, 5 O. S. 42 ; 9 O. S. 388 ; 11 O. S. 579. A motion for
a new trial is not necessary in order that the action of the court
upon the motion discharging the attachment may be reviewed
on error, 12 Bull 321. The reviewing court will not reverse the
action of the lower court upon a motion to discharge an attach
ment where questions of fact are involved, unless the action of
the lower court was clearly erroneous. Id.; see 3 C. O. R. 209.
§ 5563b. Id. Time for filing petition in error. Bond.
When an order discharging an order of attachment is
made, and a party affected thereby excepts thereto, the
court or judge shall fix the number of days, not to
exceed thirty, in which such party may file his petition in
error, and during which it shall be filed, and the attached
property held by the sheriff or other officer; the party
who files the petition in error shall give an undertaking
to the adverse party, with surety to be approved by the
clerk of the circuit court, in double the amount of the ap
praised value of the property attached, conditioned to
pay such adverse party all damages sustained by him
in consequence of the filing of the same, in the event of
the discharge of the order of attachment by the court in
which the petition in error is filed, because the same
was wrongfully obtained ; and when such petition in
error is filed, and an undertaking given, the sheriff, or other officer, shall continue to hold the property at
tached, subject to the further order of the court. [84 v.
13; 77 v. 70.]
The limitation of time for filing petitions in error under these
sections is solely for the purpose of retaining the attached prop
erty ; and in order that ihe lien on such property may be re
tained, the petition in error must be filed and bond given within
the time prescribed by the trial court, 12 Bull 308. *
§ 5563c. Id. Administrator or execntor may file peti
tion in error. If a party who excepts to an order
discharging or refusing to discharge an order of attach
ment die within the time limited for filing his petition
in error, the administrator or executor of such deceased
party may, at any time within thirty days after his ap
pointment and qualification, file his petition in error,
and thereby become a party to the action, and shall not
be required to give the undertaking required by the
preceding section ; but no such petition in error shall be
filed by an executor or administrator after one year
from the time such order is made. [77 v. 70.]
§ 5564. Grounds of attachment before debt due. A
creditor may bring an action on his claim before it is
due, and have an attachment against the property of the
debtor :
1. When a debtor has sold, conveyed, or otherwise
disposed of his property, with the fraudulent intent to
cheat or defraud his creditors, or to hinder or delay them
in the collection of their debts ; or,
2. Is about to make such sale, conveyance, or dispo
sition of his property, with such fraudulent intent ; or,
3. Is about to remove his property, or a material part
thereof, with the intent, or to the effect, of cheating or
defrauding his creditors, or of hindering or delaying
them in the collection of their debts. [51 v. 57, § 230 ;
S. &C. 1011.]
See § 5521. Attachment lies against indorser of note not due,
1 H. 442; but the operation of the section is not restricted to con
tracts for the payment of money, 12 O. S. 158. An obligation to
deliver on and after a certain day, iron metal in payment at a
:-ate agreed on for iron ore sold and delivered constitutes a claim for which an action maybe brought, and nn order of attach
ment obtained before the claim becomes due, Id. To justify the
attachment, the fraudulent intent to injure the creditoror secure
some benefit to the debtor must appear actualty to exist ; it is not
necessarily sufficient proof of that intent that it appears that
the actual or even the necessary consequences of the sale are to
hinder and delay creditors, 1 D. 351.
§ 5565. Who to grant attachment. Affidavit. The at
tachment authorized by the last section may he granted
by the court in which the action is brought, or by a judge
thereof ; but before such action shall be brought, or such
attachment granted, the plaintifff, or his agent or attor
ney, shall make an oath, in writing, showing the nature
and amount of the plaintifff's claim, that it is just, when
it will become due, and the existence of any one of the
grounds for attachment enumerated in the last preceding
section. [51 v. 57, \ 231 ; S. & C. 1011.]
See I 5522n.
§ 6666. Aotion to be dismissed, if attachment refused.
If the court or judge refuse to grant an order of attach
ment, the action shall be dismissed, but without preju
dice to a future action ; and in all such actions applica
tion for an attachment must be made. [51 v. 57, \ 232;
S. & C. 1011.]
1 D. 569.
§ 5567. Order must specify amount. The order of the
court or judge granting the attachment shall specify the
amount for which it is allowed, not exceeding a sum suf
ficient to satisfy the plaintifff's claim and the probable
costs of the action. [51 v. 57, \ 233; S. & C. 1012.]
§ 5568. Bond to be executed before order issues. The
order of attachment, as granted by the court or judge,
shall not be issued by the clerk until there is executed in
his office such undertaking on the part of the plaintifff as
is directed by § 5523. [51 v. 57, \ 234 ; S. & C. 1012.]
§ 5569. No judgment before debt is due. The plaintifff
in such action shall not have judgment on his claim be
fore it becomes due ; and the proceedings on attachment
may be conducted without delay. [51 v. 57, \ 235; S. &
C. 1012.]
Where an order of attachment has been allowed and issued
before the debt is due, and it is subsequently discharged, it is a
matter of discretion with the court whether the action shall be
dismissed or allowed to proceed after the debt becomes due. It is proper to dismiss it unless special reasons to the contrary are
shown, 1 D. 569.
§ 5570. Application of provisions of preceding chapter.
Proceedings authorized by the next preceding chapter
shall govern attachments under this chapter, so far as
the same are applicable. [54 v. 29, \ 236 ; S. & C. 1012.]
§ 5571. Injunction defined. The injunction provided
"by this title is a command to refrain from a particular
act ; it may be the final judgment in an action, or may
he allowed as a provisional remedy ; and when so allowed,
it shall be by order. [51 v. 57, § 237 ; S. & C. 1012.]
§ 5572. Causes for an injunction. When it appears by
the petition that the plaintifff is entitled to the relief de
manded, and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in
restraining the commission or continuance of some act,
the commission or continuance of which, during the liti
gation, would produce great or irreparable injury to the
plaintifff, or when, during the litigation, it appears that
the defendant is doing, or threatens or is about to do, or
is procuring or suffering to be done, gome act in viola
tion of the plaintifff's rights, respecting the subject of the
action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual, a
temporary order may be granted restraining such act ;
and such order may also be granted in any case where it
is specially authorized by statute. [51 v. 57, § 238 ; S. &
C. 1013.]

§ 5573. When and by whom injunction granted. The
injunction may be granted at the time of commencing
the action, or at any time afterward, before judgment,
by the supreme court or a judge thereof, the circuit
court or a judge thereof, in his circuit, the common
pleas court or a judge thereof, in his district, or the probate court, in causes pending therein ; and the probate
judge of the county may grant injunctions in actions
pending in either the court of common pleas or circuit
court of the county, in the absence from the county of
the respective judges of such courts, upon its appearing
satisfactorily to the court or judge, by affidavit of the
plaintifffor his agent, that such plaintifff is entitled thereto.
When the injunction ha* been allowed, and during the
pgndency of the action in the common pleas court has been
vacated, either by a judge thereof in vacation, or by the
court previous to the trial of the action, and an appeal
is taken, after such trial, from the judgment or final
order of the common pleas court to the circuit court, an
injunction may be granted at any time before judgment
or final order in the action in the circuit court, by the
circuit court in which action is pending, or a judge
thereof, upon its appearing satisfactorily to such court
or judge, by affidavit of such party or his agent, that he
is entitled thereto ; and upon like proof, an injunction
may also be allowed by the supreme court or the circuit
court, or by a judge of either, as a temporary remedy,
during the pendency of a case on error or appeal in such
courts respectively. [85 v. 151 ; 84 v. 36 ; 83 v. 61 ; 82 v.
16 ; 55 v. 6, \ 239 ; S. & C. 1015.]
The supreme court can not grant injunctions in actions in
other courts, 17 O. S. 144 ; 2 O. S. 498 ; but under this section the
supreme court may allow a temporary injunction on error, 36
O. S. 316, 416 ; 38 O. S. 32.
§ 5574. Notioe of application. If, in the opinion of
the court or judge, the defendant, or any party to the
suit, should be heard before granting the injunction, a
reasonable notice may be required to be given to such
party of the time, place, and purpose of the application;
and such party may, in the meantime, be restrained.
[51 v. 57, 1 240 ; S. & C. 1015.]
§ 5575. When notice required. An injunction shall
not be granted against a party who has answered, except
upon notice ; but such party may be restrained until the
decision of the application for an injunction. [51 v. 57,
§ 241 ; S. & C. 1016.]
§ 5576. Injunction bond required. No injunction, un
less otherwise provided by special statute, shall operate
until the party obtaining the same gives an undertaking, executed by sufficient surety, to be approved by the clerk
of the court granting the injunction, in an amount to be
fixed by the court cr judge allowing the same, to secure
to the party enjoined the damages he may sustain if it
be finally decided that the injunction ought not to have
been granted. [51 v. 57, § 242; S. & C. 1016.]
Execution against the principal is required before action on
the bond, 11 O. 342, and should be averred, 13 O. 135, unless the
injunction did not operate to stay execution upon a former
judgment, 6 O. 336. Approval of the bond by the clerk need not
be averred, 1 O. S. 190. 'the bond is construed strictly in favor of
the surety, 1 O. S. 190 ; 9 O. S. 17 ; see 4 O. S. 502. It is binding,
however, though the court had no jurisdiction of the action
enjoined, and the action was never tried on its merits, 7 Bull
343; but if not given, disobedience is not punishable, 37 O. S.
473, unless the action is brought under 3 1777 to enjoin the mis
application of the funds of a municipal corporation, when no
bond is required to be given, 44 O. S. 277 ; or where a party, on
being informed that an injunction had been allowed to restrain
him from doing a particular act, does the act before there is
time to give such undertaking; see 37 O. S. 475. Damages must
be proved, 4 Rec. 670. A condition to pay the damages defend
ant may sustain by reason of the injunction, if it is decided it
ought not to be granted, includes attorney's fees and expenses
in obtaining a dissolution of the injunction, unless the dissolu
tion of the injunction is only incidental to the result, 23 O. S.
264 ; 25 O. S. 278. A condition to pay all monies and costs due
and to become due from the plaintifff in the bill, and all monies
and costs which may be decreed against him, gives a right of
action on the bond for the damages sustained when the bill is
dismissed at plaintifff's costs, 4 O. S. 002 ; but a condition that
"plaintifff shall pay to defendants the damages which they or
either of them may sustain by reason of the injunction in this
action, if it be finally decided that the injunction ought not to
have been granted," does not give a right of action on the bond
when the court dismissed the original action without prejudice
and the costs were paid by plaintifff, 41 O. S. 221. Turnpike
company can not recover as damages tolls that it could not law
fully have collected, if the injunction had not been granted, 41
O. S. 144, 145.
§ 3577. The order and its service. The order of in
junction shall be addressed to the party enjoined, shall
state the injunction, and shall be issued by the clerk;
when the injunction is allowed at the commencement of
the action, the clerk shall indorse upon the summons
"injunction allowed," and it shall not be necessary to
issue the order of injunction ; nor shall it be necessary
to issue the same when notice of the application therefore
has been given to the party enjoined ; and the service of
the summons so indorsed, or the notice of the application for an injunction, shall be notice of its allowance.
[51 v. 57, 1 243 ; S. & 0. 1017.]
§ 5578. Service of injunction allowed during litigaton. When the injunction is allowed during the liti
gation, and without notice of the application therefore,
the order of injunction shall be issued, and the sheriff
shall forthwith serve the same upon each party enjoined,
in the manner prescribed for serving a summons, and
make return thereof without delay. [51 v. 57, § 244 ;
S. & C. 1017.]
§ 5579. When injunction operates. An injunction
shall bind the party from the time he has notice thereof,
and the undertaking required .by the applicant therefore
is executed. [51 v. 57, \ 245 ; S. & C. 1017.]
An injunction operates only from the time of nolice to the
defendant or from its service, 9 O. 198. It operates in personam
only ; it does not work a change of possession or entitle a party
to claim it. If two courts have concurrent jurisdiction, the one
which first obtains possession of the subject must adjudicate,
and neither party can be forced into another jurisdiction, 2 D.
336. An injunction to stay proceedings upon a judgment oper
ates upon the parties to the judgment, and through them upon
all officers of the law acting in consequence of that judgment,
10 O. 268, 272; 14 O. 415.
§ 5580. Second application for injunction. No in
junction shall be granted by a judge after a motion
therefore has been overruled by his court on the merits
of the application ; and when it has been refused by the
court in which the action is brought, or a judge thereof,
it shall not be granted to the same applicant by a court
of inferior jurisdiction, or any judge thereof. [51 v. 57,
§ 246; S. & C. 1018.]
A bill to obtain a second injunction must show that the new
matter alleged did not exist at the time the first bill was filed,
or that if it existed, it was unknown to the complainant, 3 O. 61.
§ 5581. How enforced and disobedience punished. An
injunction or restraining order granted by a judge may
be enforced as the act of the court, and disobedience
thereof may be punished by the court, or any judge who
might have granted it in vacation, as a contempt; an at
tachment may be issued by the court or judge, upon being
satisfied, by affidavit, of the breach of the injunction or
restraining order, against the party guilty of the same;
and such party may be required by the court or judge to
pay a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars, for the use of the county, to make immediate restitution to the party
injured, and to give further security to obey the injunc
tion or restraining order, and, in default thereof, he may
be committed to close custody until he complies with
such requirement, or is otherwise legally discharged.
[72 v. 50, \ 247.]
See § 5576, note.
§ 5582. Party enjoined may apply for further security.
A party enjoined may, at any time before judgment,
upon reasonable notice to the party who obtained the
injunction, move the court for additional security ; and
if it appear that the surety in the undertaking has re
moved from the state, or is insufficient, the court may
vacate the injunction, unless, in a reasonable time, suf
ficient security be given. [51 v. 57, \ 248 ; S. & C. 1018.]
And the court, in continuing an injunction, may require ad
ditional security or a new bond to be given as a substitute for
the first. If the order is not complied with, as where by mistake
of the clerk the new bond is conditioned merely for the payment
of the costs, the former bond is not discharged, 6 O. 336 ; s. c. 7
O. (Ft. 2) 209.
§ 5583. Affidavits on hearing of application. On the
hearing of an application for an injunction each party
may read affidavits ; and all affidavits shall be filed.
[51 v. 57, \ 249 ; S. & C. 1018.]
Affidavits must be positive, 6 Rec. 415.
§ 5584. Motion, to vacate or modify injunction. When
an injunction has been granted, a party may, at any time
before the trial, apply to the court in which the action is
pending, or a judge thereof, to vacate or modify the
same ; the party applying for such vacation or modifica
tion shall give to the adverse party such notice of the
time and place at which the motion will be hoard as
the court or judge may deem reasonable; and the appli
cation may be made upon the petition and affidavits
upon which the injunction was granted, or upon affida
vits on the part of the party enjoined, with or without
answer. [82 v. 35; 54 v. 139, I 250; S. & C. 1018.]
Under the former practice, where there was an appeal from
an interlocutory order dissolving an injunction, affidavits were
competent testimony in the district court on a motion to dis
solve, 31 O. S. 561 ; 17 O. S. 144 ; see 1 C. C. K. 417, 419.
§ 5585. Affidavits on motion. When the application is made upon affidavits on the part of the defendant,
but not otherwise, the plaintifff may oppose the same by
affidavits, or other evidence, in addition to the evidence
on which the injunction was granted. [51 v. 57, \ 251 ;
S. & C. 1018.]
§ 5586. Defendant may obtain an injunction. A de
fendant may obtain an injunction upon an answer in
the nature of a counterclaim, and he shall proceed in
the manner prescribed in this chapter. [51 v. 57, \ 252;
S. & C. 1018.]
See 35 O. S. 567.
§ 5587. When receiver appointed. A receiver may be
appointed by the supreme court or a judge thereof, the
circuit court or a judge thereof in his circuit, the com
mon pleas court or a judge thereof in his district, or the
probate court, in causes pending in such courts respect
ively, in the following cases :
1. In an action by a vendor to vacate a fraudulent
purchase of property, or by a creditor to subject any
property or fund to his claim, or between partners or
others jointly owning or interested in any property or
fund, on the application of the plaintifff, or of any party
whose right to or interest in the property or fund, or the
proceeds thereof, is probable, and when it is shown that
the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed,
or materially injured.
2. In an action by a mortgagee, for the foreclosure of
his mortgage, and sale of the mortgaged property, where
it appears that the mortgaged property is in danger of
being lost, removed, or materially injured, or that the
condition of the mortgage has not been performed, and
the property is probably insufficient to discharge the
mortgage debt.
3. After judgment, to carry the judgment into effect.
4. After judgment, to dispose of the property according
to the judgment, or to preserve it during the pendency of
an appeal, or when an execution htis been returned un
satisfied, and the judgment debtor refuses to apply the
property in satisfaction of the judgment.
5. In the cases provided in this title, and by special statutes, when a corporation has been dissolved, or is in
solvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency, or has for
feited its corporate rights.
6. In all other cases where receivers have heretofore
been appointed by the usages of equity. [82 v. 35 ; 51
v. 57, $253; S. & C. 1018.]
A receiver is a ministerial officer, 12 O. S. 419. His possession
is the possession of the court, 2 D. 336; and a levy upon prop
erty in his hands is a contempt of court, 10 O. S. 372 ; 12 O. S. 419.
He may be removed by the court which appointed him, 31 O. S.
1 ; and the authority of the judge to appoint or discharge him
is not required to be exercised in the county in wh ich the action
is pending, Id. Proceedings in relation to the appointment and
removal of receivers are special proceedings, una an order affect
ing a substantial right in such proceeding is a final order, Id.
Appeal does not lie from his appointment, 10 O. S. 622, and an
appeal does not vacate the office, 24 O. S. 1. A foreign receiver
may be permitted to take possession of property in this state, 38
O. S. 174, 184, and a receiver may be appointed in this state to take
possession of property in a foreign country when all the owners
are within the jurisdiction of the court and it is otherwise a
proper ease for the appointment of a receiver, 11 Bull 319.
1. In an action by a creditor to subject any property or fund
to his claim, see 11 O. S. 323. And a receiver will be appointed
to take possession of mining property, although the persons in
terested in itaie not partners, where there is a number of joint
proprietors who can not agree as to the working of the mines
or the disposition of the property, 11 Bull 319. And where an
insolvent corporation was making no effort to pay its debts, and
its business could not be continued without loss and wasting of
its assets, the sale of its property and collection of its accounts
being necessary for the payment of its debts, on application of
a surety of the corporation to compel payment of its indebted
ness, under § 5845, the appointment of a receiver was held au
thorized under this section, 45,O. S. 133. But where no fraud or
insolvency was charged, and it did not appear that the property
was in danger of removal beyond the jurisdiction of the court,
the controversy being solely as to the effect of an attempted con
solidation of railroads, the appointment of a receiver was re
fused, 37 O. S. 649, 659.
2. In such action, mortgagees held entitled to funds in the
hands of the receiver in the order of their priorities, 41 O. S. 682.
4. Receiver appointed to secure income to satisfy alimony.
W.492.
"
5. Action by creditors to compel receiver to set aside fraudu
lent conveyance of dissolved corporation made before dissolu
tion, 40 O. S. 575 ; see 2 C. C. R. 518 ; 46 O. S. .
6. See 45 O. S. 133.
§ 5588. Who ineligible as receiver. No party, at
torney, or person, interested in an action, shall be ap
pointed receiver therein except by consent of the parties.
[51 v. 57, § 254; S. & C. 1019.]
Mortgagee ineligible, 4 Bull 294 ; 8 Rec. 23.
§ 5589, Oath and undertaking by receiver. The re
ceiver, before he enters upon his duties, must be sworn
to perform them faithfully, and, with surety approved
by the court, judge, or clerk, execute an undertaking to
such person, and in such sum, as the court or judge shall
direct, to the effect that he will faithfully discharge the
duties of receiver in the action, and obev the orders of
the court therein. [51 v. 57, ? 255 ; S. & C. 1019.]
§ 5590. Powers of receiver. The receiver shall have
power, under the control of the court, to bring and detend actions in his own name, as receiver, to take and
keep possession of the property, to receive rents, collect,
compound for, and compromise demands, make trans
fers, and generally to do such acts respecting the prop
erty as the court may authorize. [51 v. 57, § 256 ; S. & C.
1019.]
A receiver of an insolventcorporation may maintain an action
to recover interest paid by it to a national bank under R. S. U. S.
§ 5198, 17 Bull
A railroad receiver is a proper party plaint
iff in a suit to restrain ditch proceedings against the company
commenced after bis appointment, 2 C. C. R. 10. A foreign re
ceiver has been permitted to sue in his own name to recover
property in this state, 38 O. S. 174. Leave of court must be first
had before an action can be maintained against a receiver, 2 D.
336 ; but it is sufficient if notice of the application for leave to sue
is given to the receiver only, 20 O. S. 150; railroad receivers,
however, may sue and be sued without leave of court, § 3415, in
any county through or into which the road is constructed, § 3416,
though, under the federal practice, a receiver can not be sued
in another court without the permission of the court appointing
him. 5 Bull 533, 780. A railroad receiver is liable for injuries re
sulting from negligence in the operation of the road, 20 O. S. 137,
15(i, while the railroad company under his control is not liable,
2 liull 249; but judgments against him can only be satisfied from
funds in bis hands, 20 O. S. 137. A mandamus will not be al
lowed against the corporation and receiver, directing their con
duct in operating the road, 35 O. S. 154. A petition in an action
on a promissory note, brought by a receiver, which alleged that
the plaintifff was duly appointed such receiver by a court hav
ing power to appoint, and that there was due the plaintifff, as
such receiver, etc., is sufficient on demurrer, 29 O. S. 499. A
party injured by the negligent operation of a railroad company
in the hands of a receiver, may, by leave of court, bring an
action against him " as receiver," and it is no defense in such
action that the receiver was a public officer, or that he was an
agent or trustee, 20 O. S. 137. Set-otf may be pleaded in action
brought by receiver of national bank, 31 O. S. 231. Attorney's
fees payable out of the fund, 35 O. S. 581. Receiver of insolvent
corporation to distribute proceeds of sale of its property ac
cording to the laws relating to estates of insolvent debtors, 14
Bull 109. Levy on property in hands of, 3 O. O. R. 489.
§ 5591. Investment of funds by receiver. Funds in
the hands of a receiver may be invested upon interest,
by order of the court ; but no such order shall be made
except upon the consent of all the parties to the action.
[51 v. 57, § 257 ; S. & C. 1019.]
§ 5592. Disposition of property in hands of trustee.
When it is admitted by the pleading, or on the exami
nation of a party, that he has in his possession, or under
his control, any money or other thing capable of deliv
ery, which, being the subject of the litigation, is held by
him as trustee for another party, or which belongs or is
due to another party, the court may order the same to be
deposited in court, or delivered to such party, with or
without security, subject to the further direction of the
court. [51 v. 57, § 258 ; S. & C. 1019.]
§ 5593. How certain orders of court may be enforced.
"When a court, in the exercise of its authority, orders
the deposit or delivery of money or other thing, and the
order is disobeyed, the court, besides punishing the dis
obedience as for a contempt, may make an order requiring
the sheriff to take the money or thing, and deposit or
deliver it in conformity with the direction of the court.
[51 v. 57, I 259 ; S. & C. 1019.]
§ 5594. Causes for which sheriff or other officer may
be amerced. If an execution or order of sale directed
to an officer come to his hands to be executed, and he
neglect or refuse to execute it ; or if he neglect or refuse
to sell property of any kind which, by any writ or order,
he is directed to sell ; or fail to call an inquest, or to re
turn to the clerk's office a copy of the certificate of ap
praisement made by the inquest ; or neglect to return to
the proper court an execution or order of sale to him
directed on or before the return day thereof ; or neglect
to return a correct inventory of personal property taken
on execution, unless he return that the amount of the judgment, including costs, has been paid to Mm ; or neg
lect, on demand, to pay to the person entitled thereto,
any money by him collected or received for the use of
such person , at any time after he collects or receives the
same ; or neglect or refuse, on demand, to pay to the
judgment debtor all money by him received on any sale
made, beyond what is sufficient to satisfy the writ or
order of sale, "with interest and costs, such officer shall,
on motion in court, and notice thereof, in writing, as
provided in the next section, be amerced in the amount
of such judgment, including costs, with ten per cent,
thereon, to and for the use of such plaintifff or defend
ant, as the case may be. [61 v. 57, \ 451 ; S. & C. 1084.]
The sheriff is amereible only in cases which come within
the spirit as well as the letter of the statute, 10 O. 45 ; 3 O. S.
522 ; 10 O. S. 28, 77 ; 16 O. S. 50. He is not amereible for proceeds
of goods sold under agreement of parties in a non-judicial way,
3 O. S. 522; uor for price of goods sold on credit by agreement
of parties, 10 O. S. 77; nor if execution is for more than the
proper amount, 16 O. S. 50; nor for refusal to pay over money
before confirmation of sale, 2 O. 503; nor where there is no law
authorizing the writ, 2 H. 173; nor for a fine collected, see 1
W. L. J. 500, for not returning copies, see Id. 104. Return by
sheriff that bond was taken for redelivery of goods, and that
goods were not delivered, is no excuse, 6 O. 450; nor is attach
ment of money received by sheriff on execution, 1 O. 275. De
mand of monies due should be made, but action may be brought
before actual demand, and interest will be allowed from the
commencement of the action. 2 r,. 490. Amercement was not
within statute of limitations, 1 W. L. J. 305; it is a penal pro
ceeding to be strictly pursued, W. 720. On payment of amerce
ment, sheriff is subrogated to the rights of plaintifff, 33 O. S. 85.
Quxre: Whether sheriff can be amerced before return, 3 O. S.
522. Amercement of attorneys, when suit dismissed, for nonattendance ; for refusal to pay over monies collected, \ 564 ; of
justices of the peace, § 6700, in probate court, 541, 542.
§ 5595. Notice of motion for amercement. If the of
ficer resides in the county in which the motion is made,
the notice shall be served upon him at least two days
before the motion is heard ; but if he is an officer of an
other county, the notice shall be served upon him, or left
at his office, at least fifteen days before the first day of
the term at which the motion will be heard, or sent to
him by mail at least sixty days before the first day of
such term. [51 v. 57, $ 451; 64 v. 64, \ 455; S. & C.
1084 ; S. & S. 565.]
No pleading required, 6 O. 449, but facts must be stated in
motion. 12 O. 210. Slightest variance between notice of motion and motion itself fatal, 3 O. S. 522. When return of sheriff shows
on its face a due execution of the writ, the plaintifff on motion
to amerce can not go behind it, but is left to his remedy by
action for false return, 12 O. 220; but date of return indorsed is
not conclusive, 10 O. S. 28. Motion must be made in open court ;
filing it in the clerk's office is not sufficient, 3 O. S. 522.
§ 5596. Amercement for not serving or returning proc
ess. If an officer fail to execute any summons, order,
execution, or other process (1), directed to him, or to re
turn the same, as required by law, unless he make it
appear, to the satisfaction of the court, that he was pre
vented by unavoidable accident from so doing, he shall
be amerced, upon motion and notice, as provided in
§ 5594, in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars,
and be liable to the action of any person aggrieved by
such failure; but he shall not be liable to an action or
amercement for a failure to execute any such process
directed to him from any county other than that in
which he was elected, unless his fees are deposited with
the clerk who issued the process, and an indorsement of
that fact is made and subscribed by such clerk on the
process, at the time of its issue, in these words : " Funds
are deposited to pay the sheriff on this process." (2)
[65 v. 96, § 592; S. & S. 572.]
1. Judgment against sheriff amerced for neglect to execute
final process should include the amount of the original judg
ment, interest thereon, costs, and ten per centum upon the
whole sum thus miideup ; and the judgment amercement draws
interest as other judgments until paid, 12 O. 210. 2. And a ten
der of his fees can not be substituted in place of such indorse
ment, 10 O. 45.
§ 5597. Clerks may be amerced for not paying over
money. If a clerk of a court neglect or refuse, on de
mand, to pay to the person entitled thereto any money
by him received in his official capacity for the use of
such person, he may be amerced, on motion and notice,
as provided in § 5594. [51 v. 57, ? 452 ; S. & C. 1085.]
§ 5598. Amount of amercement for not paying over
money. When the cause of amercement is the refusal to
pay over money collected, the officer shall not be amerced
in a greater sum than the amount withheld, with ten per
cent, thereon. [51 v. 57, § 453 ; S. & C. 1085.]
§ 5599. Surety of officer may be made party to judg
ment. A surety of an officer may be made party to the
judgment rendered as aforesaid against such officer, by action, but the goods and chattels, lands and tenements,
of such surety, shall not be liable to execution when
sufficient goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the
officer against whom execution is issued, can be found
to satisfy the execution ; and either party may-proceed
against the officer by attachment. [51 v. 57, \ 456 ; S. & C.
1086.]
Action on judgment of amercement may be brought against
sureties on official bond in the county where the amercement
was had. although none of the defendants resided in such
county, 14 Neb. 532; see \ 5025.
§ 5600. Officer may have execution on original judg
ment. If an officer who is amerced has not collected the
amount of the original judgment, he shall be permitted
to sue out an execution, and collect, for his own use, the
amount of the judgment, in the name of the original
plaintifff'. [51 v. 57, I 457 ; S. & C. 1086.]
Where the sheriff in such ease is amerced and sues out exe
cution the process should be directed to the coroner, 33 O. S. 85.
§ 5601. Arbitration of controversies. Submission may
be made a rule of oourt. All persons who have any
controversy, except when the possession or title of real
estate may come in question, may submit such contro
versy to the arbitrament or umpirage of any person or
persons, to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, and
thev may make such submission a rule of any court of
record in the state. [29 v. 264, § 1 ; S. & C. 80.]
Administrators and executors may submit disputed claims to
arbitration at common law. 9 O. S. 333, and under the statute,
§ 6093 ; 9 Bull 244; 11 Bull 117, pending suit, 9 Bull 244; 11 Bull
117 (and the fact that an executor has rejected a claim on which
suit has been brought does not estop him from submitting it to
arbitration, 11 Hull 117); see 5 Rec. 367; but not a claim as to
real estate, 1 Clev. R. 93. Contractors or sub-contractors under
mechanic's lien law, § 3200, county commissioners at common
law, but not so as to divert fund, 2 I). 189. Employer and em
ploye may submit disputes to arbitration, 82 v. 45. Municipal
corporations, disputed claims, for "persons" in the statute in
clude municipal corporations, 42 O. S. 'n'i. A partner, W. 420.
Stockholders of railroads in case of sale, lease, or aid by sub
scription, \ 3802, or consolidation, 1 3388. At common law the
submission may be revoked before award rendered, 1 D. 370; 4
O. 310 ; but not after the arbitrators are sworn^under the statute,
19 O. 245; 1 O. S. 463; see 1 D. 370. Submission anew vacates
award, W. 174. Agreement to submit can not be enforced. 1 O. S.
166, as provided in revaluation clause of lease. 22 (i. S. 4(i3. The
arbitrators are constituted, by the parties, chancellors, judges,
and jurors, and have jurisdiction of the law and fact, and they
may, after hearing the parties and their proofs, meet for consul
tation and decision without giving either party notice of such
meeting, 7 O. (Pt. 1) 99. The statute (toes not provide for taking
exceptions before a board of arbitration, and if such exceptions
are taken the case is not reviewable thereon, 42 O. S. 543.
§ 5602. Parties to arbitration may enter into bonds.
The parties to such submission may enter into and ex
change arbitration bonds, which shall be conditioned for
the faithful performance of the award, and set forth the
names of the arbitrators (1) or umpire, and the matters
submitted to their determination ; and when such is the
agreement, the submission shall be made a rule of any
court of record within the state, or a rule of any particu
lar court of record named in the submission. [29 v. 264,
?2; S. &C. 81.]
1. ID. 370 ; 2C. S. 0. R.3.
§ 5608. Time and place of hearing to be specified in
bonds. The arbitration bonds shall specify a time and
place for the hearing, allowing the arbitrators or umpire
the right to adj'ourn from time to time, unlil a conclusion
is reached ; and a time shall be named in the bonds within
which the award shall be made. [29 v. 264, ? 3 ; S. & C. 81.]
§ 5604. How process obtained. The parties shall have
the benefit of legal process to compel the attendance of
witnesses, which process shall be issued by the clerk of
the court of common pleas or any justice of the peace
for the county in which the arbitration is held, and shall
be returnable before the umpire or arbitrators on a day
and place certain therein named. [29 v. 264, \ 4 ; S. &
C. 81.]
§ 5605. Disobedience of process, etc, a contempt of
oourt. When a witness who has been duly served with
such process fails to attend in obedience thereto, or to be
sworn or to answer as a witness, except in case of a de
mand and failure to pay his fees, he shall be deemed
guilty of contempt of the court from which the process
issued; and on complaint made by the party injured, to
the court of common pleas whose clerk issued the proc
ess, or to the justice, as the case may be, such court or justice may proceed against him as in other like cases.
[29 v. 264, ? 5 ; S. & C. 81.]
§ 5606. Arbitrators, witnesses, etc., to be sworn. The
umpire or arbitrators, and all witnesses for any party to
the arbitration examined by the umpire or arbitrators,
shall be under oath, to be administered to him or them
respectively by any judge or justice of the peace of the
county. [29 v. 264, § 6 ; S. & C. 81.]
The oath can not be administered by a notary pulKic, 36 O. S.
281 ; but where the defendant, an attorney at law, was present
when the oath was administered by a notary public, and made
no objection to the proceeding, be was held to have waived the
objection, 9 Bull 244; 11 Bull 117. Waiver of oath, 45 O. S. 377;
18 Bull 373. Not required at common law, 11 Bull 200.
§ 5607. Award to be in writing, etc. The award shall
be in writing, and signed by the umpire or arbitrators,
or a majority of the arbitrators, named in the submis
sion ; and a true copy of the award shall, without delay,
be delivered by the umpire or arbitrators to each of the
parties in interest. [29 v. 264, 1 7 ; S. & C. 81.]
Majority only need sign the award, 5 Bull 415. At common
law, a majority can not make an award, 16 O. S. 573. The statu
tory award must state the time and place of meeting, 3 O. 286,
but not at common law, nor is it necessary at common law that
the award should state that the parties were notified, witnesses
examined, and evidence offered, or that the award was published
from the office of the arbitrator, 11 Bull 200. An award to de
liver books, papers, and accounts, a small chest and wearing
apparel is too indefinite to be enforced, 3 O. 266. What interest
sufficiently definite to be determined by arbitrators, 5 Bull 415.
The decision of a court can not be treated as an award, 19 O. S.
392, unless it had no jurisdiction, 6 O. 490. The award may be
under the direction of the court, though it is not bound by it,
1 O. S. 100 ; see 45 O. S. 377 ; 18 Bull 373.
§ 5608. Award to be filed in oourt when parties neg
lect, etc, to oomply with same. If either of the parties
neglect or refuse to comply with the award, the other
party may file the award, together with the submission or
arbitration bond, in the court named in the submission,
or, if no particular court is named therein, then in the
court of common pleas of the county where the arbitra
tion was held. [29 v. 264, § 8 ; S. & C. 82.]
§ 5609. How award for payment of money enforced.
The court, at the next term thereof after the award is
filed, if no legal exceptions be made or taken to the
award, or to other proceedings, and the award is for the payment of money, shall enter judgment thereon, as on
the verdict of a jury, between the parties, and issue ex
ecution thereon as in other cases immediately after the
amount specified in the award is due and payable. [29
v. 264, §9; S. & C. 82.]
No action is required to be brought on the award under this
nor under § 6093, providing for the arbitration of doubtful claims,
by executors and administrators, but the court may enter judg
ment on the award when made, 11 Bull 117. Under the statute,
however, there must be a rule and notice before judgment can
be entered, W. 86. An award under the common law operates
neither as a judgment nor verdict, and the failure to perform it
may constitute a cause of action, or its performance may furnish
a good defense in a subsequent suit between the parties on the
same subject matter, but no judicial action can be had upon it
without pleadings as in other cases, 9 O. S. 333 ; 10 O. S. 512. In
an action on an award at common law, the petition must aver
both the submission and award, 3 O. 510. Objections to an award
must be filed at first term, 1 O. S. 463. Judgment entered upon
an award at the same term at which it is filed is valid, 10 O. S. 365,
§ 5610. How award other than for payment of money
enforced. When the award directs the performance of
any act or thing other than the payment of money, a
party who disobeys it shall be liable to be punished as
for a contempt of court, either by attachment or execu
tion, as the nature of the case requires. [29 v. 264, ? 10 ;
S. & C. 82.]
§ 5611. Power of court to set aside award. If legal
defects appear in the award or other proceedings, or if
it be made to appear, on oath, at the term of the court
at which the award and arbitration bond are filed, that
the award was obtained by fraud, corruption, or other
undue means, or that the arbitrators or umpire misbe
haved, the court may set aside the award, and the mat
ters submitted shall be retained by the court for trial as
upon appeal ; the court shall direct who shall be plaint
iff and who shall be defendant in the action, and such
proceedings shall thereafter be had therein, and such
pleadings filed, as in a civil action ; and the court may
make such order as to costs in the premises, or such
other order on the award, as it deems just and right.
[74 v. 78, 111.}
An award may be set aside by agreement, W. 174 : for interest
or misconduct of arbitrators, 1 D. 370 ; for error of law appearing
on its face, 1 H. 334; for any good equitable grounds, 20 O. S. 231;
for uncertainty, 3 O. 266 (1827); but not for mistake in signing
submission, 1 6. S. 166; nor because of relationship of arbitrator
mto party, when the opposite party, knowing of the fact, made no
objection until after the award was made, 38 O. S. 423 ; see 3 O.
186 ; 7 O. (Pt. 1) 99 ; 42 O. S. 543. Power of court to order remitti
tur, 11 Bull 117 ; see 45 O. S. 377.
§ 5612. What proof required before court will enforce
award. In all cases the party enforcing an award shall
produce satisfactory proof to the court of Ihe due exe
cution of the submission or arbitration bond, and that
the party neglecting or refusing to obey the award was
furnished with a true copy thereof at least ten days
before the term at which the application to enforce the
award was made. [29 v. 264, f 12; S. & C. 83.]
Proof may be waived, 1 O. S. 463.
§ 5613. Fees of arbitrators, etc., to be taxed in the
award. Each person chosen as and performing the
duties of an arbitrator or umpire under this chapter
shall be entitled to receive one dollar per day for his
services; and each witness for his attendance, and jus
tice or judge for administering oaths, shall be entitled
to like fees as in other cases, which fees shall be taxed
by the umpire or arbitrators, and included in the award.
[29 v. 264, §13; S.&C. 83.]
§ 5614. Complaint and warrant for arrest. When an
unmarried woman, who has been delivered of or is preg
nant with a bastard child, makes complaint thereof in
writing, under oath, before any justice of the peace,
charging a person with being the father of such child,
the justice shall thereupon issue his warrant, directed to
any sheriff or constable of this state, commanding him
to pursue and arrest such accused person in any county
in the state, and bring him forthwith before the justice
to answer the complaint. [70 v. Ill, § 1.]
The action may be brought though the complainant is not a
resident of, 5 Bull S89; 41 O. S. 280. and though the child is not
born in, Ohio, 41 O. S. 280. It can not be maintained if the child
was begotten and born during lawful wedlock, 30 O. S. 027; norif,
after the child is begotten and during pregnancy, the mother con
tracts marriage with another man, who marries her with knowl
edge of her condition, 43 ii. S. 473. Marriage of the complainant,
however, is no defense if the marriage was void, 12 Bull 234; and marriage after the prosecution is begun does not terminate
it, 21 O. S. 646 ; and where the child was begotten during mar
riage, but born after a divorce, and it was shown that complain
ant had been deserted by her husband several years previous
and could not have had access to him, a verdict and judgment
that the child was a bastard and defendant its father, it was
held, would not be disturbed, 9 Bull 2.S7. The compluint must
show that complainant is unmarried, W. 564 ; see 8 O. 376. A
mayor has jurisdiction in bastardy concurrent with justices,
§ 1744, 36 O. S. 624. A bastardy prosecution is only quasi crimi
nal, and if in the name of the state should be on the complaint
of, etc., but it would be more proper to curry on the suit in the
name of the party complaining, W. 564. The prosecuting attor
ney is not bound to attend to such suits, Id.
§ 5615. Examination of the complainant. Upon the re
turn of the warrant the justice shall examine the com
plainant, under oath, in the presence of the accused,
respecting the cause of her complaint; the accused shall
be allowed to ask the complainant, when under oath,
any question he may think necessary for his defense ;
and the examination of the complainant by the justice,
the questions of the defendant, and the answers thereto
by the complainant, shall be reduced to writing, in the
presence of the justice, and subscribed by the complainant. [74 v. 11, §2.]
On such examination, the justice is authorized to administer
an oath only to the complainant, and no other witnesses can be
examined, 26 O. S. 81.
§ 5616. Adjournment of examination, and bond to
answer complaint. The justice may, on the request of
either party, and upon good cause shown, continue
the examination for a period not to exceed ten days,
upon the accused entering into a recognizance to the
state of Ohio, with sufficient surety, in a sum not less
than three hundred nor more than six hundred dollars,
to appear and answer the complaint, at the time fixed
for the hearing thereof, and abide the order of the justice.
§ 5617. Compromise and bond. If, during the exami
nation before the justice, or at any time before judg
ment in the court of common pleas, the accused pay, or
secure to be paid, to the complainant, such amount of
money or property as she may agree to receive in full
satisfaction, and give bond to the state of Ohio, with
sufficient surety, to be approved by the justice, court, or
judge in vacation, conditioned to save any county, township, or municipal corporation within the state free from
all charges for the maintenance of such bastard child,
the justice, court, or judge in vacation, shall discharge
the accused from custody, upon payment of the costs of
prosecution ; but such agreement shall be made or ac
knowledged by both parties, in the presence of the justice,
court, or judge, who shall thereupon enter a memoran
dum thereof upon his docket, or cause the same to be
made upon the journal. [74. v. 11, § 2.]
A plea of former prosecution and compromise is defeated by
showing fraud, 31 O. S. 522. A compromise without payment or
security to township is no defense, 1 W. L. J. 396 ; 2 W. L. M. 308.
It is no defense to an action on a note given on settlement to
show that the child died, or that the settlement was not made
according to the statute, 8 O. S. 265. An answer to be a bar to
such proceeding must show : 1. The payment, or securing to be
paid, to the complainant the amount of money or property
agreed to be received in full satisfaction. 2. The giving "bond
to the state of Ohio with sufficient surety," to be approved and
conditioned as required by said section. 3. The discharge of the
accused from custody, upon payment of the costs of prosecution.
4. That the agreement was made or acknowledged by both par
ties in the presence of the justice, and a memorandum thereof
entered upon his docket. Where such answer shows the first
and fourth requirements, but fails to show the other two, the
defense is not made out, 2 C. C. R. 188. Sufficiency of entry of
compromise by justice, 31 O. S. 522. Under the act of 1824 the
complainant could only settle while the complaint was pending
before the justice, but not after accused was recognized, 4 O. S. W58.
§ 5618. When no compromise made, accused to be rec
ognized. When a compromise is not made, the justice
before whom the complaint was made shall bind the ac
cused to appear at the next term of the court of common
pleas, in a recognizance to the state of Ohio, with suffi
cient surety, in a sum not less than three hundred nor
more than six hundred dollars, to answer the accusation,
and abide the order of the court ; and on neglect or re
fusal to find such security, the justice shall cause the
accused to be committed to the jail of the county, there
to be held to answer the complaint. [70 v. 112, \ 4.]
Sureties discharged by appearance of accused, 24 O. S. 177, if
before forfeiture, 38 O. S. 606. The recognizance is not invali
dated by the omission of the word " next" (term). Id.; nor for
error in naming the township for the benefit of which, under 70
v. 112, the recognizance was required to be executed, 29 O. S. 452.
The action on a recognizance under this section is in the name of
the state, Id., but the mother is the party in interest, 10 Rec. 307.
§ 5619. Proceedings for discharge, on bail, of person
committed in default therecf. A person committed to with sufficient surety, in a sum not less than one hundrea
nor more than six hundred dollars, to be taken and ap
proved by a judge of the court of common pleas, or the
probate judge of the county, and by him filed in the
office of the clerk of the court of common pleas. [70 v.
112, } 5.]
§ 5620. Justice shall file transcript and papers with
olerk. The justice before whom the examination is had
shall, within thirty days thereafter, file with the clerk of
the court of common pleas of the county a certified tran
script of the proceedings, together with the recognizance,
if any be taken, and all other papers therein. [70 v.
112, i 6.]
The neglect of a justice to file the transcript and other papers
within thirty days does not defeat the prosecution. When the
transcript filed in the common pleas has been lost, a new one
may be substituted ; and if the written examination of the com
plainant has been lost, its contents may be proved by parol, and
for"that purpose the complainant is a competent witness ; and if
at the trial term such papers are lost, a motion by the defendant
to continue the cause until the papers are found is addressed to
the discretion of the court, and the overruling of the motion is
not error, 26 O. S. 7.
§ 5621. Continuance of cause in common pleas. Effect
on bond. If, at the next term of the court, the com
plainant has not been delivered, or is unable to attend,
or if there be any other sufficient reason therefore, the
court may order a continuance of the cause; and such
continuance shall operate as a renewal of the recogni
zance, which shall remain in full force until final judg
ment. [70 v. 112, § 7.]
Where the transcript and recognizance were filed at the term
of the court to which the defendant was recognized, but there
was no order continuing the cause either at that term or the next
term thereafter, and at the next, being the third term, the re
cognizance was forfeited, the cause tried, and a verdict of guilty
rendered and judgment pronounced against the defendant iii his
absence, it was held that, there being uo continuance of the
cause at the first term, the recognizance did not bind the defend
ant to appear at any subsequent term, and the trial in his ab
sence was unauthorized, 31 O. S. 147. The case may be continued
as other cases, 23 O. S. 320 (8. & C. 117). A general entry will con
tinue the case, 10 Rec. 307.
§ 5622. Surrender of accused by sureties, and new re
cognizance. If the sureties on the recognizance, at any term of the court of common pleas, surrender the ac
cused, and request to be released from the recognizance,
or if the court deems the recognizance insufficient, the
court may order a new recognizance to be taken, cancel
the first recognizance, and commit the accused until a
new recognizance is given. [70 v. 112, § 7.]
An answer of a surety that he took the accused and, at a sub
sequent term of the court, surrendered him in open court, and
requested a release from the recognizance, without stating
whether such surrender was before the recognizance was for
feited or before final judgment in the bastardy suit, or that the
recognizance was canceled, is insufficient, 38 O. S. 606.
§ 5623. Failure of accused to appear at oourt, and for
feiture of recognizance. If the accused fail to appear at
the term of the court to which he is recognized, his re
cognizance shall be forfeited ; and if a verdict of guilty
be rendered, and judgment entered thereon as hereinafter
provided, the amount of such forfeited recognizance shall
be applied in payment of the judgment. [70 v. 112, § 8.]
§ 5624. Aocused permitted to defend. Before or upon
the hearing of the complaint, the court, in every case,
shall permit the accused to appear in person, or by coun
sel, and make defense. [70 v. 115, \ 20.]
§ 5625. The trial in oourt. When the accused pleads
not guilty of the charge, before the court to which he is
recognized to appear, or, having been recognized, fails to
appear, the court shall order the issue to be tried by a
jury ; and at the trial of such issue, the examination be
fore the justice shall be given in evidence bv the com
plainant. [70 v. 113, 1 9.]
A trial can not be had without the presence and testimony of
complainant, 16 O. 56, 57. Defendant is a competent witness, 9
S. 402 ; see 6 Bull 124, 125 ; 20 Id. 318.
§ 5626. Order of oonrt when aocused adjudged reputed
father. If the accused, in person or by counsel, confess
in court that the accusation is true, or if, upon the trial,
the jury find him guilty, he shall be adjudged the reputed
father of the bastard child, and shall stand charged
with the maintenance thereof in such sum as the court
shall order and direct, with payment of costs of prosecu
tion ; the court shall require the reputed father to give
security to perform such order ; and in case he neglect
or refuse to give such security, and pay the costs of
prosecution, he shall be committed to the jail of the county, there to remain, except as provided in the next
section, until he complies with the order of the court.
[70 v. 115, § 21 ; 72 v. 49, § 10.]
The section is not unconstitutional because it provides for
imprisonment, the sum in which the defendant is charged not
being a debt 'within the meaning of § 15, article i., of the consti
tution, 21 O. S. 853. An order of maintenance is a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction, and can not be impeached col
laterally ; and such judgment may be enforced by execution as
In other cases, the security given being only to be resorted to in
case of the inability of the defendant, 9 O. 149. The provisions
of 1 5519 have no application to a proceeding under this chapter,
15 O. S. 43. The court may apportion costs if the jury return a
verdict of not guilty, 14 Neb. 210.
§ 5627. When putative father entitled to benefit of
provisions of law relating to insolvent debtors. Such
putative father, after having been confined in prison for
the period of three months, for failing to comply with
the order of the court provided for in the last section,
shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of law
relating to insolvent debtors, in the same manner as per
sons imprisoned for debt ; but before such putative
father shall receive or be entitled to such benefits, he
shall give at least three days' notice to the complainant
or her attorney of his intention to apply therefore. [72
v. 49, § 10.]
§ 5628. Effect of death of mother upon prosecution, if
child living. The death of the mother shall not abate
the prosecution, if the child is living, but a suggestion
of the fact shall be made, and the name of the child sub
stituted upon the record for that of the mother, and a
guardian ad litem appointed, who shall not be liable for
costs ; and in such case the testimony of the mother, re
duced to writing before the justice, mav be read in evi
dence. [70 v. 113, § 11.]
Defendant is not liable if child is still-born, 7 Rec. 566.
§ 5629. Effect of death of child upon prosecution, if
mother living. The death < f a bastard child shall not
be cause of abatement, or bar to a prosecution for bas
tardy, if the mother is living; but the court trying the
cause shall, on conviction, take the death into consider
ation, and give judgment for such sum as it deems just,
the payment of which, or security therefore, may be en
forced as above provided. [70 v. 113, § 13.]
§ 5630. Upon death of child after judgment, court may
modify amount. Upon the death of a bastard child after
judgment, and before the expiration of the time limited
for the last payment on the judgment, the court which
rendered the judgment may, on motion and notice, make
such reduction in the amount of the same as is proper
and just in consequence of such death. [70 v. 113, § 12.]
§ 6631. Justice to furnish complainant transcript on
failure of officer to arrest acoused. When it appears from
the return of the officer upon the warrant that the ac
cused could not be arrested, the justice shall, upon
demand, forthwith make a certified transcript of the
proceedings had before him, including copies of the
complaint and warrant, with the return thereon, and
deliver the same to the complainant, or her agent or at
torney. [70 v. 113, § 14.]
§ 5632. Order of attachment and grounds therecf.
Upon the filing of the transcript mentioned in the pre
ceding section, in the office of the clerk of the court of
common pleas of the county in which the justice resides,
an order of attachment shall be issued by the clerk,
when there is filed in his office an affidavit of the com
plainant, her agent or attorney, showing :
First. That the complainant is the mother of a bastard
child, or that she is pregnant with a child which, if born
alive, will be a bastard.
Second. That the accused person is the father of such
child.
Third. The existence of one or more of the following
grounds :
1. That the accused is a non-resident of this state; or,
2. Has absconded with the intent to defraud complain
ant ; or,
3. Has left the county of his residence to avoid the
service of a warrant ; or,
4. So conceals himself that a warrant can not be served
upon him. [70 v. 113, § 15.]
§ 5633. Proceedings under attachment same as in oivil
actions. The order of attachment shall issue without an
undertaking ; the amount of property seized thereon
shall not exceed one thousand dollars in appraised
value; and attachments under this chapter shall be
subject to the provisions of this title in reference to attachments in civil actions, and be governed in all respects
thereby. [70 v. 114, \\ 16, 17, 18.]
§ 6634. Service by publication. Upon the return of
the order of attachment, service may be had by the pub
lication, for six consecutive weeks, in some newspaper of
general circulation in the county wherein the cause is
pending, of a notice of the pendency of the proceeding,
stating the object thereof, the substance of the complaint
and that an order of attachment has been issued and
served therein ; and in such case, copies of the complaint
and order of attachment, with the return thereon, shall
forthwith be deposited in the post-office, directed to the
accused at his place of residence, unless it be made to
appear to the court, by affidavit or otherwise, that such
residence is unknown to the complainant, and could not,
with reasonable diligence, be ascertained by her. [70
v. 114, §19.]
§ 5635. Personal service of copies of complaint when
residence of defendant known. If the defendant's place
of residence is known, personal service of certified
copies of the complaint and order of attachment, with
the returns thereon, may be made at complainant's elec
tion, instead of service by publication ; and the cause
may be heard and determined at any time after the ex
piration of six weeks from the time of personal service,
or the first publication of the notice provided for in the
last section. [70 v. 115, \ 19.]
§ 5636. Order of court with respect to attached prop
erty. If, upon such trial, the accused be adjudged to be
the reputed father of the child, the court shall order that
unless the defendant, within a day to be fixed by the
court, pay the sum adjudged against him, with costs of
prosecution, so much of the property remaining in the
hands of the officer, after applying the money arising
from the sale of perishable property, and so much of the
personal property, and lands and tenements, if any, as
may be necessary to satisfy such order, be sold, under the
same restrictions and regulations as if the same had been
levied on by execution ; the money arising therefrom.with
the amount that may be recovered from the garnishee,
shall be subject to the order and control of the court,
and be applied to satisfy such order in such sums and
at such times as the court may order and direct; if there
be not enough to satisfy the same, the order of the court
shall stand, and execution may issue thereon for the
residue, in all respects as in judgments at law ; and any
surplus of attached property, or its proceeds, shall be re
turned to the defendant. [70 v. 115, 1 22.]
§ 6637. Provision for prosecution of suits by persons
interested in support of child. When a woman has a
bastard child, and neglects to bring a suit for its main
tenance, or commences a suit and fails to prosecute it to
final judgment, the trustees of a township, or treasurer
of a municipal corporation, interested in the support of
such bastard child, or the directors of a county infirmary
in which she becomes a charge, may, when sufficient
security is not offered to save such county, township, or
municipal corporation from expense, make complaint in
behalf of such county, township, or municipal corpora
tion, against him who is accused of begetting such child,
or may take up and prosecute a complaint begun by the
mother of such child. [70 v. 112, 1 3.]
§ 5638. Who may recover on bond given in bastardy
proceeding. The directors of the infirmary of a county,
the trustees of a township, or the treasurer of a munici
pal corporation, in which a bastard child becomes a
charge, may sue and recover upon any bond given to the
state of Ohio in any proceeding against the reputed
father of such bastard child ; and the provisions of this
chapter, and all the remedies herein allowed, shall apply
to all classes [cases] in which the infirmary directors,
trustees of townships, or treasurers of municipal corpora
tions, are authorized to commence or prosecute a com
plaint against the reputed father of an illegitimate child.
[70 v. 115, I 23.]
When such recognizances are forfeited the full amount of the
penalty, with interest from the date of forfeiture, may be recov
ered without averring any loss or damage sustained by the
mother of the child or the township where it was born, 23 O. S.
§ 5639. What contempts may be punished summarily.
A court, or judge at chambers, may punish, summarily,
a person guilty of misbehavior in the presence of or so
near the court or judge as to obstruct the administration
of justice. [32 v. 17, ? 1 ; S. & C. 258.]
W. 78, 421 ; 19 Bull 181, 302 ; 21 Id. 404 : 46 O. S. : SC.C.R
263, 383.
§ 5640. What acts are oontempts of court. A person
guilty of any of the following acts may be punished as
for a contempt :
1. Disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ, proc
ess, order, rule, judgment, or command of a court or an
officer.
2. Misbehavior of an officer of the court in the per
formance of his official duties, or in his official transac
tions.
3. A failure to obey a subpoena duly served, or a re

fully required.
4. The rescue, or attempted rescue, of a person or of
property in the custody of an officer by virtue of an
order or process of court held by him.
5. A failure upon the part of a person recognized to
appear as a witness in any court, to appear in compli
ance, with the terms of his recognizance. [32 v. 17, § 1.]
Refusal to pay alimony, 3 C. C. R. 419 ; of witness to answer
question, Id. 263.
Refusal to abate nuisance, 32 O. S. 276 ; to submit to non-suit,
W. 334; of excluded witness to withdraw, 39 O. S. 73. Attorney
signing appeal bond in violation of rule of court, 6 O. 428 ; inter
fering with receiver without leave of court, 2 D.366; 1 C. S. U. R.
188; 10 O. S. 372; fraudulent interference with files of court, 11
O. S. 681 (1 Cur. 122); misbehavior of officer in charge of jury, 10O.
459; refusing to make return to writ of habeas corpus, 1 W.L.J.
168. Mandate requires lower court to punish contempt for dis
obedience, 41 O. S. 401. Defendant can not be imprisoned for
contempt for failure to pay money as decreed or ordered, unless
his conduct in refusing to obey is fraudulent, 6 O. S. 254, 262 ; nor
where person having possession of the money claims to own it,
42 O. S. 109, 112.
§ 5641. When aooused entitled to be heard. In cases
under the last section, a charge in writing shall be
filed with the clerk, an entry thereof made upon the
journal, and an opportunity given to the accused to be
heard, by himself or counsel; but this section shall not
bo so construed as to prevent the court from issuing proc
ess to bring the accused party into court, or from hold
ing him in custody, pending such proceedings. [75 v.
745, \ 3.]
9 O. S.338(1 Cur. 122). 
§ 5642. Bight of accused to bail. In proceedings un
der the second section [5640], if the writ is not return
able forthwith, the court may fix the amount of an un
dertaking to be given by the accused, with surety to the
satisfaction of the sheriff; and upon the return of a writ,
when it is not convenient to hear the charge without
delay, the court shall fix the amount of an undertaking
to be given, with surety to the satisfaction of the clerk,
for the appearance of the accused to answer the charge.
[75 v. 746, 1 4.]
§ 5643. Bail bond to be given to satisfaction of clerk.
Upon the execution of such undertaking, with surety to
the satisfaction of the sheriff or clerk, the accused shall
be released from custody. [75 v. 746, § 5.]
§ 5644. Trial by the court. Upon the day fixed for
the trial the court shall proceed to investigate the charge,
and shall hear any answer or testimony which the ac
cused may make or offer. [75 v. 746, § 6.]
§ 5645. Punishment if found guilty. The court shall
then determine whether the accused is guilty of the con
tempt charged; and if it be adjudged that he is guilty,
he may be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or im
prisoned not more than ten days, or both. [75 v. 746, § 7.]
§ 5646. Imprisonment until order obeyed. When the
contempt consists in the omission to do an act which is
yet in the power of the accused to perform, he may be
imprisoned until he performs it. [75 v. 746, \ 8.]
§ 5647. Proceedings when party released on bail fails
to appear. Jf the party be released on bail, and fail
to appear upon the day named, the court may issue an
other order of arrest, or may order the undertaking for
his appearance to be prosecuted, or both; and if the un
dertaking be prosecuted, the measure of damages in the
action shall be the extent of the loss or injury sustained
by the aggrieved party by reason of the misconduct for
which the contempt was prosecuted, and the costs of the
proceeding, and such recovery shall be for the benefit of
the party injured. [75 v. 746, § 9.]
ji 5648. Bight of court who committed prisoner to re
lease him. When a person is committed to jail for con
tempt, the court or judge who made the order may dis
charge him from imprisonment when it appears that the
public interest will not suffer thereby. [75 v. 746, \ 10.]
§ 5649. Judgment final. The judgment and orders of
a court or officer made in cases of contempt may be re
viewed on error ; but proceedings in error therein shall
not suspend execution of the order or judgment until
there is filed by the person in contempt, in the court
rendering the judgment, or in the court or before the

§ 5650, When the provisions of this chapter apply.
This chapter is not cumulative to the provisions of di
vision three, chapter three, of this title, nor of chapter
five, title three, of this part, but furnishes a remedy in
cases not thereby provided for. [75 v. 746, § 12.]
§ 5689. For what causes divorce may be granted.
Courts of common pleas may grant divorces for the fol
lowing causes :
1. That either party had a husband or wife living at
the time of the marriage from which the divorce is sought.
2. Willful absence of either party from the other for
three years.
3. Adultery.
4. Impotency.
5. Extreme cruelty.
6. Fraudulent contract.
7. Any gross neglect of duty.
8. Habitual drunkenness for three years.
9. The imprisonment of either party in a penitentiary under sentence thereto; but the petition for divorce un
der this clause shall be filed during the imprisonment of
the adverse party.
10. The procurement of a divorce without this state,
by a husband or wife, by virtue of which the party who
procured it is released from the obligations of the mar
riage, while the same remain binding upon the other
party. [51 v. 377, $1,2; S. & C. 509, 511.]
A petition for divorce should allege : 1. That the plaintifff, at
the time of filing the petition, is an actual resident ofthe county
where it is filed. 2. That he or she had a bona fide residence in
the state at least one year before the application. 3. The time
and place of marriage, and the names and ages of the children,
if any. 4. A specific brief statement of the cause of praying for
divorce. 5. If alimony be sought for, the petition should set out,
as near as may be, the kind and amount of the personal prop
erty, and describe the real estate, of the defendant, 5 O. 538. The
district court has no jurisdiction to review on error the proceed
ings of the court of common pleas in cases of divorce and ali
mony, 6 O. S. 64. Appeal lies m cases of alimony, § 5706. A de
cree for divorce may be set aside for fraud, 7 Bull 20, but not in
an action commenced at a subsequent term, 9 O. S. 534; 11 Bull
10; see 12 Bull 33.
1. W. 150 s. C 5 O. 539 ; 19 O. S. 588.
2. WiMful absence, W. 138, 147, 210, 225, 226, 454, 470, 719. It must
be willful on the part of the defendant, W. 469, against the will
of plaintifff, W. 475, 636, without plaintifff's fault, W. 416, and
for three years after abandonment of intention to return, W. 224.
It is not sufficient if the wife leaves for want of support, W. 455.
3. Adultery. The petition must state the time and place of the
act, 5 O.538; W. (VI3; the name of the person with whom the
offense was committed, or allege a good excuse for the omission,
W. 98, 210, 284, 302 ; 5O. 538. A divorce will not be granted where
the applicant is living in adultery, 2 O. 233 ; nor on the applica
tion of the husband when the wife, seduced, married, and aban
doned by him, commits adultery, 2 Bull 47; 5 Rec. 674. The
general reputation of plaintifff is admissible in evidence, and
may defeat the action, 2 O. 233; W. 283, but not that of defend
ant, W. 283. Adultery may be proved by circumstances, W. 148.
It can not be proved under a general charge, W. 636. Sufficient
proof of adultery, see W. 156, 161, 454, 469, 514, 559, 643 : 7 Bull 304.

Specific acts must be stated. W. 563. It formerly consisted of acts
of personal violence only, W. 563, and words were not sufficient,
W. 212; but profane and abusive language, and charges of a want
of chastity, made in the presence of plaintifff and others, have
been held sufficient, 15 Bull 113; see 30 Kas. 712 s. c. 10 Bull 409;
32 Kas. 744; 33 Kas. 1. Subjection of wife to excessive sexual
intercourse, see 11 Bull 169-173. Wife guilty of, 1 Bull 153; 30

6. Fraudutent contract. Pregnancv as aground for divorce, W.
630; 10 Bull 95 ; 205 (citing eases). Congenital imbecility renders
a marriage coutract void ab initio. It was alleged in the action by the imbecile's guardian that the contract was procured by
fraud, 22 O. S. 271. Fraudulent representations as to name, re
spectability, connections, and wealth of party, are not sufficient,
4 Bull 368.
7. Any gross negtect of duty, 1 Bull 163 ; see 1 dev. R. 148. The
particular duties neglected must be stated, 1 Bull 164. Mere
failure to support is not, 8 Bull 88, 89, when the wife has means,
7 Bull 302, 303; nor willful absence for less than three years, 1
Bull 163 ; but three years' failure to support, when defendant is
able to do so, may be, 3 W. L. M. 328. It can not be proved by
showing adultery, W. 763.

§ 5690. Residence of plaintifff. Where petition to be
filed. The plaintifff, except in an action for alimony
alone, shall have been a resident of the state at least one
year before filing the petition ; all actions for divorce,
or for alimony, shall be brought in the county where the
plaintifff has a. bona fide residence at the time of filing the
petition, or in the county where the cause of action
arose; and the court shall hear and determine the same,
whether the marriage took place, or the cause of divorce
occurred, within or without the state. [70 v. 258, \ 8.]
1 Bull 164 ; 44 O. S. 449, 455.
§ 5691. Residence of wife not to be affected by that of
husband. When a wife files her petition for a divorce,
or for alimony, the residence of her husband shall not
be so construed as to preclude her from the provisions
of this chapter. [51 v. 377, § 12 ; S. & C. 514.]
§ 5692. Service when defendant resident of the state.
When the defendant is a resident of this state, the clerk
shall issue a summons, directed to the sheriff of the
county in which he or she resides, or is found, which,
together with a copy of the petition, shall be served on
the defendant at least six weeks before the hearing of
the cause. [54 v. 131, § 3 ; 70 v. 258, § 8 ; S. & C. 511.]
§ 5693. Notice when defendant's residence unknown.
When the defendant is not a resident of this state, or his
residence is unknown, notice of the pendency of the
action must be given by publication, as in other cases ;
and unless it be made to appear to the court, by affida
vit or otherwise, that his residence is unknown to the plaintifff, and could not, with reasonable diligence, be
ascertained, a summons, and a copy of the petition, shall
forthwith, on the filing of the petition, be deposited in
the post-office, directed to the defendant at his place of
residence. [54 v. 131, § 3 ; S. & C. 511.]
See 5 O. 318 (act 1824).
§ 5694. When oause may be heard. The cause may
be heard and decided at any time after the expiration
of six weeks from the service of summons, or the first
publication of notice. [54 v. 131, § 3 ; S. & C. 511.]
§ 5695. Answer, hearing, and judgment. If the de
fendant fail to appear, or, having appeared, admit or
deny in his answer the allegations in the petition, the
court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine the
cause; and if, upon the hearing, any of the causes for
divorce charged in the petition be proven to the satis
faction of the court, it may pronounce the marriage
contract dissolved, and both of the parties released from
the obligations thereof. [51 v. 377, §4 ; S. & C. 512.]
Confessions of the parties are not evidence, W. 212, 854, but
conversations are when part of the res gestae, W. 632. Depositions

by counsel is insufficient, 2 W. L. J. 427.
§ 5696. Divorce not to affect legitimacy of children.
The granting of the divorce, and the dissolution of the
marriage, shall in no wise affect the legitimacy of the
children of the parties thereto ; and the court shall make
such order for the disposition, care, and maintenance of
the children, if there are any, as is just and reasonable.
[51 v. 377, §4; S. & C. 512.]

§ 5697. Pleadings. Competency and effect of testi
mony and admission of the parties. Pleadings under
this chapter need not be verified ; and a divorce, or a
judgment for alimony, shall not be granted upon the
testimony or admission of a party unsupported by other
testimony, nor shall any admission be received in evi
dence which the court has reason to believe has been ob
tained by fraud, connivance, coercion, or other im
proper means. [51 v. 377, 4, 5 ; S. & C. 512.]
See I 5695n.
§ 5698. Evidence of marriage. Proof of cohabitation,
and reputation of the marriage of the parties, shall be
competent testimony to prove such marriage, and may
be, within the discretion of the court, sufficient evidence
thereof. [51 v. 377, § 6 ; S. & C. 512.]
Marriage provable by parol, 1 Bull 164.
§ 5699. Bights of widow when divorce granted for
aggression of husband. When a divorce is granted by
reason of the aggression of the husband, the wife shall,
by force of the judgment of divorce, be restored to all
her lands, tenements, and hereditaments, not previously
disposed of, and, if she so desire, the court shall restore
to her any name she had before such marriage ; she shall
be allowed such alimony out of her husband's real and
personal property as the court deems reasonable, having
due regard to the property which came to him by mar
riage, and the value of his real and personal estate at
the time of the divorce, which alimony may be allowed
to her in real or personal properly, or both, or by decree
ing to her such sum of money, payable, either in gross
or installments, as the court deems just and equitable (1);
and if the wife survive her husband, she shall also be
entitled to her right of dower in the real estate of her
husband not allowed to her as alimony, of which he
was seized at any time during the coverture, and to
which she had not relinquished her right of dower (2).
[51 v. 377, § 7; S.&C. 512.]
1. History of legislation—dormancy of decree, 21 Bull 277.
Alimony may be decreed a wife as against a bigamist, 19 O. S.
588, and where an ex parte foreign divorce had been granted,
44 O. S. 449, though Invalid, 19 O. S. 502, and on refusal of di- i
vorce, W. 632, in case of abandonment, W. 491 ; was allowed an
adulteress where there was hope of reclamation, and the prop
erty was earned by the parties jointly, W. 514. Real property
may be decreed a wife as alimony in fee, 21 O. S. 657; in fact,
all the title which the husband had in the premises becomes
vested in her by force of the decree, 36 O. S. 590, and the court
may, in decreeing her alimony, take into consideration property
acquired by the husband by inheritance since the date of an ex
parte foreign divorce, 20 O. S. 439. When alimony is decreed her
in installments, execution may be had for the installments as
they become due, 9 O. 37 ; but the installments should be lim
ited to the husband's lifetime, 34 O. S. 1 . The allowance may be
increased on account of the ill-health of the wife, 32 O. S. 33, and
successive allowances may be made pending suit or appeal, 38
O. S. 370; and the removal of the wife from the state and her re
marriage, pending an appeal, will not deprive the appellate
court of power to decree her alimony, 38 O. S. 370 ; but her remarriage, pending suit, to a man financially able, and who does
in fact support her, would be prima facie good cause for modify
ing a former decree so as to reduce the amount, 43 O. S. 499. Ad
ditional alimony can not be allowed after final decree, 28 O. S.
596. A decree for alimony does not operate as a lien on the real
estate of the husband unless made a charge thereon by the de
cree itself. 10 O. 268; and, when so made, it has no priority over
that of other creditors, 24 O. S. 488; but where, in an action for
divorce and alimony, there has been an injunction pendente Me
to prevent alienation, a decree for alimony made a lien upon
the premises is superior to the lien of a mortgagee who had act
ual notice of the proceedings and whose mortgage was executed
and recorded pending those proceedings, 30 O. S. 579. The court
first acquiring jurisdiction can alone decree as to the custody of
children, 9 Bull 271, and when once acquired the jurisdiction
continues, 15 O. S. 427 ; 38 O. 3. 370, 558. Attorney's fees allowed
when alimony decreed pendente We, W. 120. Acceptance of part
in full satisfaction of decree awarding alimony, estoppel, 11 Bull
191. Husband's imbecility no ground for recovery, 3 Bull 738.
A final order, 1 D. 299. Allowance of temporary alimony by
judge at chambers a final order, 38 O. S. 370. Separate action by
wife as to property decreed to her, 1 O. S. 403 ; W. 205. 2. 4 Bull
645; 2 Clev. R. 274. A married woman divorced by reason of
the aggression of her husband, and who subsequently marries
another man during the life of her first husband, if she survives
the latter will be entitled to dower in the real estate of which
the first husband was seized at any time during coverture, 44
O. S. 015; see 46 O. S. 78; 20 O. S. 454 iact 1840). 10 O. S. 5%,
to the contrary, was decided under the act of 1824, which omit
ted the provision for dower in addition to alimony.
§ 5700. Bights of wife when divoroe granted upon her
own aggression. When the divorce is granted by reason
of the aggression of the wife, she shall be barred of all
right of dower in the lands of which her husband is
seized at the time of filing the petition for divorce, or
which he thereafter acquires, whether there is issue or
not; and the effect of the judgment of divorce shall be
to restore to her the whole of her lands, tenements, or
hereditaments not previously disposed of, and the court
shall adjudge to her such share of the husband's real
or personal property, or both, as it deems just and rea
sonable. [51 v. 377, 1 7 ; S. & C. 512.]
The provisions of this section do not apply to divorces in an
other state, 10 O. 28 ; see 9 Bull 159.
§ 5701. Application for alimony pendente lite. The
court, or a judge thereof in vacation, may, on notice to
the opposite party of the time and place of the applica
tion, grant alimony to the wife for her sustenance and
expenses during the suit, and an allowance to her for the
support of minor children dependent upon the husband for support, and not provided for by him, during the
pendency of an action for divorce, or for alimony
alone (1). When an appeal is taken by either party to
the circuit court, that court, or a judge thereof in vaca
tion, may grant like alimony and support during the
pendency of the appeal, upon like notice (2). Any per
son or corporation having possession or control of, or
claiming any interest in, any property, real or personal,
of the husband, out of which the wife seeks alimony,
may be made a party defendant (3). When it is made to
appear to the court, or a judge in vacation, that a hus
band is about to dispose of or incumber his property, or
any part thereof, so as to defeat the wife in obtaining
alimony, such court or judge may allow an injunction
to prevent the same, with or without bond, at discre
tion (4); and the wife may sell and assign the order for
alimony or allowance after the same is made. [83 v. 60.]
Contempt for non-payment of alimony, 3 C. C. R. 419.
1 . See $ 5699, notes ; W. 104, 120, 308 ; and attorney's fees will be
allowed, W. 120. But the husband is not liable for necessaries if he
is not in default for payment of alimony, 32 O. S. 33 ; 5 Bull 794.
The adequacy of the alimony can not be collaterally impeached
by a stranger, 32 O. S. 33. 2. The allowance by a judge of the
court of common pleas, as a judge of the district court, of tem
porary alimony pending an appeal as to permanent alimony, is
not a bar to another allowance by such judge pending such ap
peal; and the signature of the judge to the order, or journal
entry thereof, is not essential to the validity of the order, 38 O. S.
370. 3. A third person made defendant in the action, on the
ground that he had property of the husband which ought to be
charged with alimony, can appeal so much of the case as affects
his interest, 15 O. 404. 4. Injunction against alienation is lis
pendens, 30 O. S. 579; see Attorney's Fees, 3 C. C. R. 107.
§ 5702. Causes for which alimony allowed. Crosspetition. When the wife files her petition for divorce or
alimony, the husband may file a cross-petition for di
vorce, upon either cause mentioned in § 5G89 ; the wife
may file her petition for alimony alone, or, if a petition
for divorce has been filed by the husband, she may file
her cross-petition for alimony, with or without a prayer
for the dissolution of the marriage contract; and such
petition or cross-petition for alimony may be for the fol
lowing causes :
1. Adultery.
2. Any gross neglect of duty.
3. Abandonment of the wife without good cause.
4. That there is a separation in consequence of illtreatment on the part of the hushand, whether the wife
is maintained by the husband or not.
5. Habitual drunkenness.
6. Sentence to and imprisonment in a penitentiary;
in which case the application must be made while the
husband is so confined. [54 v. 131, § 10 ; S. & C. 513.]
See I 5689, notes. Petition for alimony alone sustained where
an ez parte foreign divorce was granted, 44 O. S. 449, though the
foreign divorce was invalid, 19 O. S. 502 ; see 13 Bull 3 ; 15 Bull
232; 17 Bull 2. Defendant cross-petitioner need not issue sum
mons to plaintifff, 9 Bull 24.
§ 5703. Proceedings on petition for alimony alone.
The court shall, upon satisfactory proof of any or all of
the charges in the petition, make such order for the dis
position, care, and maintenance of the children of such
marriage, if there are any, as is just and reasonable, and
give judgment in favor of the wife for such alimony out
of her husband's real and personal property as is just
and equitable, which may be allowed to her in real or
personal property, or both, or in money, payable either
in gross or in installments; and the effect of such judg
ment shall be to restore to the wife all her lands, tene
ments, and hereditaments not previously disposed of,
and to vest in her the right and power to acquire, hold,
manage, and dispose of property, money, and choses in
action, and to bring and maintain suits in her own be
half, free from the control or interference of her hus
band, unless the court, for good cause, vest such prop
erty or powers in trustees, for her use and benefit. [51
v. 377§11; S.&C. 514.]
See \\ 5699, 5702, notes.
§ 5704. Change of venue. Upon application of a
party, and his or her affidavit that a fair and impartial
hearing and determination can not be had before the
court in which a petition for divorce or alimony is
filed, a change of venue shall be allowed, and the cause
removed to any county of the same judicial district for
hearing and determination. [51 v. 377, § 13 ; S.& C. 514.]
§ 5705. Injunction to prevent husband from disposing
of property, etc A married woman may file her petition
in the court of common pleas, setting forth that her hus
band, from habitual intemperance, or any other cause, ft 5706-5707
is about to waste and squander the property, legal or
equitable, money, credits, or choses in action, to which
she is entitled in her own right, or any part thereof, or
is proceeding, or about to proceed, fraudulently to con
vert the same, or any part thereof, to his own use, for the
purpose of placing the same beyond her reach, and de
priving her of the benefit thereof, and the court may en
join the husband from disposing of, or otherwise inter
fering with, such property, money, credits, or choses in
action, and may appoint a receiver to manage and con
trol the same for the benefit of the wife, and may also
make such other order in the premises as it deems just
and proper ; upon the filing of the petition, a provisional
injunction may be allowed as in other cases, with or
without bond, at discretion ; and such petition shall be
filed in the county where the petitioner resides, and the
husband made a party defendant in the same manner as
in the case of a petition for a divorce. [51 v. 377, § 14;
S. & C. 514.]
§ 5706. Appeal. No appeal shall be allowed from
any judg.ment or order of the court of common pleas
under this chapter, except from an order dismissing the
petition without final hearing (1), or from a final order
or judgment granting or refusing alimony (2), or in
cases under \ 5705; when judgment is rendered for both
divorce and alimony, the appeal shall apply only to bo
much of the judgment as relates to the alimony (3); and
when an appeal is taken by the wife, she shall not be re
quired to give bond. [75 v. 751 ; 54 v. 131, \ 17 ; S. & C.
515.]
1. Appeal lies in cases of divorce when the petition is dis
missed without hearing, 4 Bull 368; it did not lie in 1846, 15 O.
404, nor in 1856, 6 O. S. 64, nor in 1859, 10 O. S. 369. 2. Appeal lies
from alimony alone under act of 1857, 25 O. S. 71. but not from
alimony pendente lite. Id. Whare a petition for alimony was dis
missed on final hearing in the common pleas, the case was not
appealable to the district court in 1867, 17 O. S. 563. 3. 19 O. S. 
§ 5707. How heir may assign dower. When the lands
of a deceased person are not incumbered by mortgage,
or by judgment obtained against such decedent during  life, the heir, or guardian of any heif or other person
having the next immediate estate of inheritance, may
assign to the widow or widower dower therein by writ
ing, under his hand, particularly describing the same,
which, if approved in writing on the deed of assign
ment, by the probate judge of the county, and also by
the probate judge of the county appointing such guard
ian, and accepted by the widow or widower in writing
thereon, shall be a good assignment in law. [86 v. 184.J
Of what estates a widow endowed. Conceyance in lieu of dower,
etc. Under {I 4188, as amended, 84 v. 135, a " widow or widower
who has not relinquished or been barred of the same, shall be
endowed of an estate for life in one-third of all the real property
of which the deceased consort was seized as an estate of inherit
ance at any time during the marriage, and in one-third of all the
real property of which the deceased consort, at decease, held the
fee simple in reversion or remainder ; and also in one-third of all
the title or interest that the deceased consort had, at decease, in
any real property held by article, bond, or other evidence of
claim; and the widow or widower may remain in the mansion
house of the deceased consort, free of charge, for one year, if dower
is not sooner assigned ; but dower shall not be assigned to any
widow or widower in any real property of which the deceased
consort, at decease, held the fee simple in reversion or remainder,
until the termination of the prior estate." § 4189 provides for
a conveyance in lieu of dower, to take effect on grantor's death,
which, if accepted, bars the grantee's right of dower, unless the
grantee is within the age of minority, or the conveyance is made
during marriage, when the grantee may waive the title to such
real property and demand dower; §4190, that, when such con
veyance proves defective, dower may be demanded ; § 4191, that
a widow or widower, evicted from such property, or any part of
it, shall be endowed of so much of the residue of the real prop
erty of the deceased consort as will equal that from which such
widow or widower is evicted ; 2 4192, that adultery bars dower,
unless condoned; 2 4193, that it a husband or wife gives up any
real property by collusion or fraud, or lose the same by default,
the widow or widower may recover dower in the same ; § 4194,
that dower is forfeited by waste. The act abolishes the estate by
the curtesy saving vested rights.
Under decided cases a widow is dowabte in land mortgaged by
husband and wife when the mortgage debt is paid, 16 O. S. 193;
28 O. S. 503, or in entire proceeds alter payment of mortgage debt

paying charge on land devised, 39 O. S. 172; dowable in wild
land, 8 O. 418. Dower is allowed only to widow who was wife of
person dying at the time of his death, 10 O. S. 596 ; 20 O. S. 454 ; 9
Bull 159, unless she has been divorced for his aggression, when
she is entitled to dower if she survives him, though she marries
again, \ 5099, notes. She is not dowabte in lands sold for taxes, 8

value of the real estate in which it is found the plaint
iff would have been entitled to dower, from the time of
filing the petition until death, after deducting one-third
of the necessary expenses; and the sum so adjudged in
favor of such executor or administrator shall be a lien
upon the real estate in which such plaintifff would have
been entitled to dower, and its payment may be enforced
by sale as upon execution. [86 v, 184.]
1. 2 Bull 76. Formerly the right ceased with her death, 14 O.
20; see 44 O. S. 645, 661.
§ 6712. Appointment of commissioners to assign dower.
When dower is adjudged, the court shall appoint three
judicious, disinterested men of the county in which the
action is pending, who are not of kin to either of the par
ties interested, to be commissioners, and issue its order
to the sheriff of that county, commanding him that, by
the oaths of the commissioners, which may be adminis
tered by him, he cause to.be set off and assigned such
dower to the plaintifff, in the manner set forth in the
judgment. [54 v. 27, § 12 ; 38 v. 37, 1 1 ; S. & C. 521, 522.]
The value is to be estimated as of the time of assignment, in
cluding improvements made by the heir, 10 O. 498; excluding
improvements made by purchasers, 6 O. 76; 8 O. 418 ; 4 W. L.￼
J.

§ 6713. Proceedings upon return of assignment of dower.
The commissioners and sheriff shall in all things obey the order, and return their proceedings thereon to the
court at such time as the court appoints ; if the court

puted and ascertained by the commissioners. [86 v. 185 ;
29 v. 249, §14; S. & C. 521.]
§ 5715. Dower during pendency of action. The com
missioners shall, after they have set off and assigned
dower, make a just and true appraisement of the yearly
value, after deducting necessary expenses, of the real
estate in which the widow or widower is entitled to
dower, estimating such value from the day of filing the
petition to the day of assignment of dower, and make
return of such appraisement and assignment, and the
court shall adjudge the payment of one-third of the
whole sum so returned, to the widow or widower out of
the real estate not covered by the dower, upon which
judgment execution may issue; but nothing herein con
tained shall be so construed as to require execution to
be issued against suoh of the defendants in dower as are
miuors ; but in all such cases the dower shall operate as
a lien upon the real estate, for their proportion of the
judgment, until the same is fully paid. [86 v, 185 ; 41 v.
6, 81; S. & C.522.]
Rents, issues, and profits should be estimated as of the time
the action is brought, 1 D. 527; commissioners re-appointed, Id.

tions and proceedings wherein the court may order the
sale of real estate to satisfy any judgment or decree, the
widow or widower of any decedent who has a dower in
terest therein, being a party, may file an answer, and
waive the assignment of dower by metes and bounds,
and ask to have the estate sold free of dower, and to
have allowed, in lieu thereof, such sum of money out of
the proceeds of the sale as the court deems the just and
reasonable value of the dower interest therein. [86 v. 185.]
II she receives her dower from the proceeds of the sale, she is
estopped to claim dower in the land sold, 22 O. S. 833. Court

§ 57S1. Guardian of insane person may elect for.
The guardian of a widow or widower who has been
adjudged insane may appear and answer for such insane

the widow or widower answered personally; but the
guardian shall be liable to the widow or widower, or the
heiis, for all damage or loss sustained by his fraud or
collusion, notwithstanding the approval of the court.
[86 v. 186.]
§ 5722. Petition to disoharge land of dower of insane
person. A person owning real property in this state, in
cumbered by the contingent or vested right of dower of
ipply, by petition, to the court of
common pleas of the county in which the real estate, or
any part thereof is situate, making defendants thereto
such insane person, and also the husband or wife and
guardian, if such person has either or both, for leave to
sell all or any part thereof, discharged and unincum
bered of such contingent or vested right of dower, which
petition shall set forth the insanity of the person, to
gether with a description of the land proposed to be
sold ; the court shall thereupon appoint a committee of
six competent men, of whom at least three are physi
cians, who shall, under oath, inquire into the fact of the
insanity of such person, and shall hear testimony to be
produced by the husband, wife or guardian, or, if there
is no such guardian, by a guardian ad litem, to be ap
pointed by the court in the action ; and the committee
shall, at any term of such court, make a report in writ
ing of the result of their investigation, signed by the
members thereof. [86 v. 186.]
§ 5723. Appraisement when person found insane. If
the committee report unanimously that such person, in
their opinion, is permanently insane, the court shall ap
point three judicious freeholders to appraise the real
estate described in the petition, whether the same is in

value of each tract. [86 v. 186.]
§ 6724. Id. Proceedings on report of value to court.
Upon the filing of such report the court may direct such
petitioner to convey, by good and sufficient deed of con
veyance, to the insane person, to be held by such person
in fee, such proportion of the real estate described in
the petition as shall to the court seem just and proper, or the court may assign to such insane person, to be held
by such person during life, after the death of the hus
band or wife of such insane person, such proportion of
the real estate described in the petition as shall to the
court seem just and proper, for the support of such insane
person, or the court may order the petitioner to invest
an amount, to be by it fixed, in the stock of a company,
or stocks created by the laws of this state, as by the court
may be designated, the profits and dividends arising from
such investment to be applied to the support and main
tenance of the insane person after the death of the hus
band or wife of such insane person ; and the petitioner
may, upon his compliance with the order of the court,
sell all the real property the petitioner is possessed of,
described in the petition, free and unincumbered of the
contingent or vested right of dower of such insane per
son. [86 v. 186.]
§ 5726. How dower of insane person barred. When
the husband or wife of an insane person conveys any
real estate in this state, in which such insane person has
a contingent or vested right of dower, by virtue of such
ownership of the husband or wife or otherwise, and the
insane person does not join the husband or wife in such
conveyance, the husband or wife may apply by petition
to the court of common pleas of the county in which
the insane husband or wife resides, or, if the insane
husband or wife resides out of the state, then in the
county in which the real estate is situate, for leave to
have any part or all of such real estate so conveyed re
leased of the dower right therein, which petition shall
set forth the insanity of the husband or wife, and a
description of the land proposed to be affected ; to which
petition the insane person, the guardian, if there is one,
and all persons in interest, shall be made defendants,
and the petition shall be proceeded in, in all respects, in
the manner prescribed in the three preceding sections,
except that instead of ordering the petitioner to sell the
real estate, or to convey or assign to such insane person
any part thereof, the court shall direct the petitioner to
make such investment as is provided in the preceding
sections, or may require the petitioner to secure the
amount to the use of the insane person by mortgage of
unincumbered real estate
value thereof ; and upon compliance by the petitioner with the
order of the court, the court shall enter a judgment re
leasing and discharging the real estate from the incum
brance of such contingent or vested right of dower, and
shall adjudge the holder of the legal title, or other party
liable, to pay to the petitioner any sum withheld or re
tained as indemnity against such dower right.
§ 5726. Who entitled to the writ. A person unlaw
fully restrained of his liberty, or a person entitled to the
custody of another, of which custody he is unlawfully
deprived, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus, to inquire
into the cause of such imprisonment, restraint, or de
privation. [29 v. 164, § 1 ; a & C. 681.]
The state courts have jurisdiction in all cases of imprison
ment, 6 O. y. 55. The jurisdiction extends to cases of void com
mitments, 2 C. S. C. R. 71; to inquiries as to cause of detention
in the house of refuge, 19 O. S. 1S4; but not to inquiries into the
title of an officer, '21 O. S. 610. The writ can not be used as a
summary process to review or revise errors or irregularities in
the sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction. If the sen
tence is not void absolutely, a petition in error is the appropriate
remedy, 7 O. S. 81 ; 22 O. S. 442 ; 1 D. 10 ; 25 O. S. 420 ; 2 C. C. ft. 168.
A petition in error is the appropriate remedy to reverse ail order
discharging a prisoner, 6 (). S. 55. and the remedy whore a pris
oner is convicted of a criminal offense, and erroneously sentenced
to excessive imprisonment therefore by a court of competent juris
diction, 25 O. S. 426, 432. Discharge of prisoner by this writ
based on the pardon of the governor is not impeachable for
fraud in obtaining it, 31) O. S. 377.
§ 5121. Who may grant it. The writ of habeas corpus
may be granted by the supreme court, the circuit court,
the common pleas court, the probate court, or by a judge
of either. [82 v. 36 ; 29 v. 164, § 1 ; 51 v. 167, § 3 ; S. & C.
681, 1213.]
The supreme court will act only in exceptional cases, 25
O. S. 440.
§ 5728. Bequisites of application therefore. Applica
tion for the writ shall be by petition, signed and verified
either by the party for whose relief it is intended, or by
some person for him, and shall specify :
1. That the person in whose behalf the application is
made is imprisoned, or restrained of his liberty.
2. The office, or name, of the person by whom he is
confined or restrained ; or, if both are unknown or un
certain, he may be described by an assumed appellation;
and the person who is served with the writ shall be
deemed the person intended.
3. The place where he is so imprisoned or restrained,
if known.
4. A copy of the commitment or cause of detention of
such person shall be exhibited, if it can be procured
without impairing the efficiency of the remedy ; or, if
the imprisonment or detention is without any legal au
thority, such fact shall appear. [29 v. 164, \ 1 ; 45 v.
45, 4, 5 ; S. & C. 681, 684-5.]
In cases other than those of controverted custody, the allega
tion of unlawful " restraint of liberty," or words of precisely the
same import, is essential in the application to give the court
jurisdiction. The defect is not cured by amendment, nor waived
by appearance of respondent and a trial, 11 Bull 186.
§ 5729. When the writ will not be allowed. If it ap
pear that the person alleged to be restrained of his
liberty is in custody of an officer under process issued
by a court or magistrate, or by virtue of the judgment
or order of a court of record, and that the court or
magistrate had jurisdiction to issue the process, render
the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be
allowed; or, if the jurisdiction appear after the writ is
allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason of
any informality or defect in the process, judgment, or
order. [29 v. 164, ? 1 ; 32 v. 23 ; S. & C. 681, 684.]
See I 5726, notes ; 2 C. C. R. 163. 8 Id. 10.
§ 5730. When the writ must be granted. A court or
judge authorized to grant the writ must, when a petition
therefore is presented, if it appear that the writ ought to
issue, grant the same forthwith. [29 v. 164, § 1 ; S. & C.
681.]
§ 5731. Who to issue the writ, and when. The writ,
upon its allowance, shall be issued forthwith, by the
clerk of the court whereof the person who granted it is
a j udge, under the seal of such court ; or, in case of emer
gency, such judge may issue the writ under his own
hand, and may depute any officer or person to serve it.
[29 v. 164, 1 1 ; S. & C. 681.]
§ 5732. How prisoner may be designated. The person to be produced shall be designated by his name, if
known, and if not known, or uncertain, he may be de
scribed in any other way so as to make known who is
intended. [45 v. 45, § 5 ; S. & C. 685.]
§ 5733. Requisites of writ in certain cases. In case of
confinement, imprisonment, or detention by an officer,
the writ shall be directed to him, and shall command
him to have the body of such person before the court or
judge designated in the writ, at a time and place therein
specified. [45 v. 45, 1 1 ; S. & C. 684.]
§ 5734. Form of writ when prisoner not in custody of
an officer. In case of confinement, imprisonment, or de
tention by a person not an officer, the writ shall be in
the form following :
The StAte of Ohio,
County, ss.
To the slierijf of our seceral counties, greeting :

§ 5735. How and where writ may be served. The writ
may be served in any county, by the sheriff of the same
or any other county, or by a person deputed by the court
or i udge. [45 v. 45, ? 2 , S. & C. 684.]
§ 5736. How executed and returned. The officer or
person to whom the writ is directed shall convey the
person so imprisoned or detained, and named in the
writ, before the judge allowing the writ, or, in case of
his absence or disability, before some other judge of the
same court, on the day specified in the writ ; and he shall
make due return of the writ, together with the day and
cause of the caption and detention of such person, ac
cording to the command thereof. [29 v. 164, ? 2 ; S. & C.
682.]
Refusal to make return is a contempt, 1 W. L. J. 168. Man
damus is the remedy when officer refuses to take prisoner before
commissioner of insolvents, 19 O. S. 581.
§ S737. When it may be returned to another judge or
oourt. When the writ is issued by a court in session, if
the court has adjourned when the same is returned, it
shall be returned before any judge of the same court;
and when the writ is returned before one judge, at a
time when the court is in session, he may adjourn the
ease into the court, there to be heard and determined.
[45 v. 45, 1 3 ; S. & C. 684.]
§ 5738. What shall be stated in the return of the writ.
When the person to be produced is imprisoned or re
strained by an officer, the person who makes the return
shall state therein, and in other cases the person in
whose custody the prisoner is found shall state, in writ
ing, to the court or judge before whom the writ is re
turnable, plainly and unequivocally :
1. Whether he has, or has not, the party in his custody
or power, or under restraint.
2. If he has the party in his custody or power, or un
der restraint, he shall set forth, at large, the authority,
and the true and whole cause, of such imprisonment and
restraint, with a copy of the writ, warrant, or other proc
ess, if any, upon which the party is detained.
3. If he has had the party in his custody or power, or
under restraint, and has transferred such custody or re
straint to another, he shall state, particularly, to whom,

§ 5741. When prisoner must be discharged. When
the judge has examined into the cause of caption and
detention of the person so brought before him, and is
satisfied that he is unlawfully imprisoned or detained,
he shall forthwith discharge him from confinement. On such examination the judge may disregard matters of
form or technicalities in any mittimus or order of com
mitment by a court or officer, authorized to commit by
law. [78 v. 113 ; 29 v. 164, \ 3.] 3 C. C. R. 10.
§ 5742. When prisoner may be committed or let to
bail. When the person is confined or detained in a legal
manner, on a charge of having committed a crime or of
fense which is bailable, the judge shall, at his discretion,
recommit him, or let him to bail ; if he be let to bail, the
judge shall cause him to enter into a recognizance, with
sufficient surety, in such sum as he deems reasonable,
the circumstances of the prisoner, and the nature of the
offense charged, considered, conditioned for his appear
ance at the court where the offense is properly cogni
zable; the judge shall certify his proceedings, together
with the recognizance, forthwith, to the proper court;
and if the person charged fail to enter into such recogni
zance, he shall be committed to prison by the judge. [29
v.164, §3; S.&C.682.]
§ 5743. When prisoner must be committed. If it ap
pear that the prisoner was committed by a judge or jus
tice, and is plainly and specifically charged in the war
rant of commitment with a felony the punishment
whereof is capital, he shall not be removed, discharged,
or bailed. [29 v. 164, § 8 ; S. & C. 683.]
§ 5744. When the return is evidence, and when only a
plea. If it appear that the prisoner is in custody under
a warrant or commitment in pursuance of law, the re
turn shall be considered prima facie evidence of the
cause of detention ; but if he is restrained of his liberty
by any alleged private authority, the return of the writ
shall be considered only as a plea of the facts therein
set forth, and the party claiming the custody shall be
held to make proof of such facts ; and upon the final
disposition of any case, the court or judge shall make
such order as to costs as the case requires. [45 v. 45, 1 8.]
3 C. C. R. 263 ; 33 O. S. 378 ; 42 O. S. 111.
§ 5745. Penalty upon olerk for refusal to issue the writ.

or make return of the same according to the command
thereof, or makes a false return thereof, or who, upon
demand made by the prisoner, or any person on his be

six hours after the demand therefore, a true copy of the
warrant of commitment and detainer of the prisoner,
shall, for the first offense, forfeit to the party aggrieved
two hundred dollare, and for the second offense four hun

imprisoned. A person who is set at large upon a writ
shall not be again imprisoned for the same offense, unless
by the legal order or process of the court wherein he is
bound by recognizance to appear, or other court having
i'urisdiction of the cause or offense; and a person who
:nowingly, contrary to the provisions of this chapter,
recommits or imprisons, or causes to be recommitted or
imprisoned, for the same offense, or pretended offense,
any person so set at large, or knowingly aids or assists
therein, shall forfeit to the party aggrieved five hundred
dollars, notwithstanding any colorable pretense or vari
ation in the warrant or commitment. [29 v. 164, § 6;
S. & C. 682.]
§ 5748. Prisoner not to be removed from oustody of
one officer to another, unless, eto. A person committed
to prison, or in custody of an officer, for any criminal
matter, shall not be removed therefrom into the custody
of another officer, unless by legal process, or the prisoner
be delivered to an inferior officer to carry to jail, or, by
order of the proper court, be removed from one place to
another within the state for trial, or in case of fire, in
fection, or other necessity; and a person who, after such
commitment, makes, signs, or countersigns any warrant
for such removal contrary to this section, shall forfeit to
the party aggrieved five hundred dollars. [29 v. 164, \ 7 ;
S. & S. 683.]
§ 5749. No person to be sent out of the state for crime
committed in the state. No person shall be sent prisoner
to any place out of this state for any crime or offense
committed within this state. [65 v. 165, ? 9 ; S. & 8.
387.]
§ 6750. A person bo transported mar have an action.
A person so imprisoned may maintain an action for false
imprisonment, against the person by whom he was so
imprisoned or transported, and against a person who
contrives, writes, signs, seals, or countersigns any writing
for such imprisonment or transportation, or aids or assists
in the same, or against any of them. [65 v. 1 65, \ 9 ;
S. & S. 387.]
§ 5751. Record of writs. Error, etc The proceedings
upon a writ of habeas corpus shall be recorded by the
clerks respectively, and may be reviewed on error as in
other cases. [45 v. 45, § 10 ; S. & C. 685.]
§ 5752. Aotion for penalties. Limitation. The penal
ties in this chapter provided may be recovered by the
party aggrieved, his executors or administrators, against
the offender, his executors or administrators, by civil
action in any court having cognizance of the same; but
no action shall be brought for any offense against the
provisions of this chapter after two years after the offense
is committed, except in cases of imprisonment of the
party aggrieved, when action may be brought within
two years after his delivery out of prison, or after his
decease, if he die in prison. [29 v. 164, § 10 ; S. & C. 683.]
§ 5753. Fees and costs. The fees of officers and wit
nesses shall be taxed by the judge, on his return of his
proceedings on the writ, and shall be collected as part of
the original costs in the case, and when the prisoner is
discharged the costs shall be taxed to the state, and paid
out of the county treasury, upon the warrant of the
county auditor; but no officer or person shall have the
right to demand payment in advance of any fees which
he is entitled to by virtue of the proceedings, when the
writ is demanded or issued for the discharge from cus
tody of a person confined under color of proceedings in
any criminal case ; when a person in custody by virtue
or under color of proceedings in any civil case is dis
charged, costs shall be taxed against the party at whose
instance he was so in custody ; and if he be remanded
to custody, costs shall be taxed against him. [45 v. 45,
§ 11 ; 8. & C. 6S5.]
§ 5754. Who may be compelled to partition. Tenants
in common, and coparceners, of any estate in lands,
tenements, or hereditaments within the state, may
be compelled to make or suffer partition thereof in
manner hereinafter prescribed. [29 v. 254, § 1 ; S. & C.
893.]
A right of entry without actual seizin will entitle a party to
partition, 2 O. S. 2Tl7. In a statutory proceeding for partitiou a
legal title in the demandant is necessary, 16 O. S. 443; 2 O. S.
336; 14 O. 502. If his title is equitable merely, the proceeding
should be under the code for an equitable partition, and the de
fendant should be brought into court by process, 16 O. S. 443.
No partition was allowed when the title was in controversy, 14
O. 502; 7 Hull 267. A mistake in the title, however, might be
corrected, 9 O. 170, but the title itself may be tried when the
proceeding is under the code, 33 O. S. 128 ; and an answer deny
ing plaintifff's title does not oust the court of jurisdiction, 27
O. S. 110; 41 Id. 81, but a statutory partitiou operates only on
the possession, and does not create any new title, 15 O. S. 337 ; 2
O. S. 207; and when parties to a proceeding for partition are
made such by publication and without actual notice, they are
not estopped thereby from setting up their legal title, 15 O. S.
337. Neither reversioners, 10 Rec. 491, nor remaindermen, 9 O.
74, are entitled to partition, but the owner of a life estate, who
also owns an interest in remainder, may have partition, 11 O.
389 ; 2 O. S. 207; 1 C. C. R. 88; see 16 O. S. 218; and the existence
of an ordinary lease for years under which the tenant is in pos
session, paying rent to the owners of the fee, is no obstacle to
partition among such owners, 16 Bull 354. Owners of a railroad
can not have partition, 38 O. S. 614, nor withdrawing members
of the Society of Separatists, 13 O. S. 144. Under the code the pro
ceeding is a civil action, 33 O. S. 128; 36O.S.125; 41 O. S. 81, and
appealable, 29 O. S. 440; 31 O. S. 53; 33 Id. 128. It was appeal
able under the act of 1S52, 3 O. S. 366, but not under the act of
1858, unless equitable relief was sought, 15 O. S. 460 ; 21 O. S.
527; nor in 1842 under the statute, 11 O. 254. It is queried
whether all actions for partition are not now appealable, 2
Yaple's Pr., etc., 835. The regularity of proceedings in partition
can not be inquired into in a collateral proceeding, 10 O. 250; 14
O. 228. The fact that two actions for partition were prosecuted
at the same time does not vitiate the regular proceedings in the
one upon which the partition is made, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 118. Pur
chaser from a tenant in common can not throw the owner of
title upon later purchasers, 9 O. 126.
§ 5755, Where proceedings for partition may be had.
When the estate is situate in one county, the proceedings
shall be had in that county ; and when situated in two
or more counties, the proceedings may be had in any county wherein a part of such estate is situate. [29 v.
254, I 1 ; S. & C. 893.]
See U 5022,5023.
§ 5756. Petition for partition. A person entitled to
partition of an estate may file his petition therefore in
the court of common pleas, setting forth the nature of
his title, and a pertinent description of the lands, tene
ments, or hereditaments of which partition is demanded,
and naming each tenant in common, coparcener, or other
interested person, as defendants therein. [29 v. 254, § 2 ;
S. & C. 895.]
The plaintifff must allege in his petition the title and interests
of the several tenants, and sustain the same by proof, 14 O. 502.
Owners of distinct parcels can not be joined, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 129. A
husband is competent to make partition of the wife's real estate,
but the right he acquires by the proceeding does not extinguish
her right, which survives to her or her heirs, 9 O. 121. Non
joinder of the husband in partition of the wife's land does not
affect his curtesy, 9 O. 118. Misnomer—" Pillsby " for " Pillsbury"—not material, Id. Service by publication sufficient, Id.
§ 5757. The order of partition. If the court find that
the plaintifff has a legal right to any part of such estate,
it shall order partition thereof in favor of the plaintifff,
or all parties in interest, appoint three disinterested and
judicious freeholders of the vicinity, to be commission
ers to make the partition, and order a writ of partition
to issue. [29 v. 254, § 2 ; 74 v. 152 ; S. & C. 895.]
Deputy sheriff may act as one of commissioners, 7 O. (Pt. 2)
118, (1836)'.
§ 5758. The writ of partition. The writ of partition
may be directed to the sheriff of either of the counties
in which any part of the estate lies, and shall command
him that, by the oaths of the commissioners, which oath
may be administered by him, he cause to be set off and
divided to the plaintifff, or each party in interest, such
part and proportion of the estate as the court shall order.
[38 v. 37 ; 74 v. 152, §4 ; S. & C. 900.]
§ 5759. Duties of commissioners. In making such
partition the commissioners must view and examine the
estate, and, on their oaths, set apart the same in such lots
as will be most advantageous and equitable, having due
regard to the improvements, situation, and quality of
the different parts thereof. [29 v. 254, § 5 ; S. & C. 896.]
Action of majority of commissioners binding, though the
name of one is improperly erased from report, 1 C. C. R. 47.
§ 5760. Commissioners' duty when more than one tract
to be partitioned. When partition of more than one
tract is demanded, the commissioners shall set off to each
plaintifffor party in interest his proper proportion in each
of the several tracts, unless the several tracts are owned
by the same proprietors in the same proportion in each
tract, in which case the whole share of any proprietor,
in all the several tracts, may be set off to such proprie
tor according to the best discretion of the commissioners.
[29 v. 254, ? 6 ; S. & C. 896.]
The ruling in 7 O. (Pt. 2) 118, that in making partition among
several tenants in common of several tracts of land, owning in
the same proportion, it is regular to assign to any one an entire
tract, was reversed by 13 O. 551.
§ 5761. Amicable partition, Before a writ of parti
tion is issued, the person of whom partition is demanded,
may appear in court in person, or by attorney, and con
sent to a partition of the estate agreeably to the prayer
and facts set forth in the petition, which amicable par
tition when made and recorded shall be valid and bind
ing between the parties thereto, and in such cases, where
the lands are divided by the commissioners among the
parties, the court shall on motion of any party in inter
est order the sheriff to execute and deliver to each per
son entitled thereto a deed for the portion set off and as
signed to such person. [78 v. 253 ; 29 v. 254, § 7 ; S. & C.
897.]
§ 5762. Commissioners to appraise land when they can
not divide it. Election to take. When the commission
ers are of opinion that the estate can not be divided
according to the demand of the writ without manifest
injury to the value thereof, they shall return that fact
to the court, with a just valuation of the estate (1);
whereupon, if the court approve of the return, and one
or more of the parties elect to take the estate at such ap
praised value, the same shall be adjudged to him or
them, upon his or their paying to the other parties their
proportion of the appraised value thereof, according to
their respective rights, or securing the same as herein
after provided (2). [65 v. 71, § 8 ; S. & S. 505.]
1. It is not necessary or regular to insert this provision in the
entry of the order for partition, 11 Bull 275. 2. Election by hus
band gives him no right in the reversion dependent on his es
tate of curtesy, 8 O. 87. Where a party having no title was made
a party to the proceeding and elected to take the land, the deed
gave him a good title, but he was held accountable (or all the
purchase money, 7 O. S. 417. Possession taken under the report.
Improvements being made will not, after the lapse of years, be
disturbed, though no entry of confirmation of the report was
made by the court, 5 O. 243. Where one had been absent and
unheard of for nearly thirty years, and his estate was partitioned
and sold, after which he returned, the purchaser was held to
have acquired no title in the land, as against him, but was held
entitled to be compensated for improvements, 36 O. S. 232.
§ 5763. Terms of payment and deed where party takes
the estate. If one or more of the parties elect to take the
estate at the appraised value, the terms of payment, un
less the court, on good cause shown, by special order,
direct and require the entire payment to be made in cash,
or unless all the parties in interest agree thereon, shall
be one-third cash, one-third in one year, and one-third
in two years, with interest, the deferred payments to be
secured to the satisfaction of the court ; and on payment
being made in full, or in part, with sufficient security
for the remainder, as above provided, the sheriff shall,
according to the order of the court, make and execute a
conveyance to the party electing to take the same. [65
v. 71, 1 8 ; S. & S. 505.]
Inchoate right of dower is divested by the sale, 6 O. S. 547, but
not by partition ; and the court will enforce contribution to
compensate the party from whom it is taken, 15 O. S. 355.
§ 5764. Sale of estate when parties do not elect to
take it. If no such election to take the estate be made,
the court may, at the instance of a party, make an order
for the sale thereof at public auction, by the sheriff who
executed the writ of partition, or his successor in office.
[29 v. 254, \ 9 ; S. & U. 897.]
Sale may be made on executor's cross-petition, 38 O. S. 46, and
proceeds paid to him, 10 Kee. 566.
§ 5765. How sale conducted, and terms therecf. All
such sales shall be made at the door of the court-house,
unless the court, for good cause, direct the same to be
made on the premises, and shall be conducted in all
other respects as a sale upon execution, except that it
shall not be necessary to appraise the estate; but the
estate shall not be sold for less than two-thirds of the
appraised value thereof, as returned by the commission
ers; and unless the court, by special order, direct and
require, on good cause shown, the entire payment to be made in cash, the purchase money shall be payable onethird on the day of sale, one-third in one year, and onethird in two years thereafter, with interest. [29 v. 254,
§ 9 ; 45 v. 49 ; 49 v. 102; S. & C. 897, 900, 901.]
Rents, unless reserved, pass by the sale, 26 O. S. 629 ; but crops
do not, 10 O. S. 124. Appraisers might purchase prior to act of
1841, 14 O. 228.
§ 5766, Confirmation of sale. Execution of deed. On
the return by the sheriff of his proceedings, the court
shall examine the same ; if sale has been made, and the
court approve such sale, the sheriff, on receiving pay
ment of the consideration money, or taking sufficient
security therefore, to the satisfaction of the court, shall
execute and deliver a deed to the purchaser. [29 v. 254,
§ 10 ; S. & C. 897.]
A misrecital in the date of the deed may be corrected, 6 O. 255.
The sheriff may acknowledge it after the expiration of his office,
8 O. 87. It lias been held insufficient without seal, 5 O. S. 307.
Judgment lien after sale does not affect the title, 8 O. S. 646 ; 22
Id. 615; 31 Id. 175. The remedy of the judgment creditor is
against the co-tenant's interest in the proceeds of the sale, 8 O. S.
640. Sheriff could make the sale, and confirmation was not nec
essary, under the act of 1820, 8 O. 415.
§ 5767. Distribution of prooeeds. Sheriff's liability.
The money or securities arising from a sale of or an
election to take the estate, shall be distributed and paid,
by order of the court, to the parties (1) entitled thereto,
in lieu of their respective parts and proportions of the
estate according to their just rights therein; and all
receipts of such money or securities by the sheriff shall
be in his official capacity, and his sureties on his official
bond shall be liable for any misapplication thereof (2).
[65 v. 71, 1 8 ; 29 v. 254, § 10 ; S. & C. 897 ; S. & S. 505.]
1. The securities must be made payable to the parties, and
payment to the sheriff is insufficient, 21 O. S. 402; 30 O. S. 299.
2. 16 O. S. 882 ; 30 Id. 299. Payment to attorney who procured
the partition sale, and who was not specially authorized to
receive the money, docs not exonerate ex-sheriff, 39 O. S. 610.
§ 5768. Proceedings when estate has been once offered
and not sold. When the estate has been once offered
and not sold, an alias writ for the sale thereof may
issue as often as need be ; and the court may order a
revaluation, by three judicious and disinterested free
holders of the vicinity, to he appointed by the court, and
direct a sale of the estate at not less than two-thirds of such revaluation, or, if the court deem it for the interest
of the parties, it may order a sale without such revalu
ation, at not less than such sum as it may fix. [29 v. 254,
§ 11 ; S. & C. 898.]
§ 5769. When successor of sheriff to make deed to
purchaser. When a conveyance of land sold, or elected
to be taken, is not made by the officer who made the
sale, the court, being first satisfied that such sale or elec
tion was regularly made, and that the purchase money
has been fully paid or secured, may, on motion, order
the sheriff of the county, or officer performing the
duties of sheriff, to execute and deliver to the purchaser,
or person electing to take the property, a deed for the
lands so sold or elected to be taken. [56 v. 152, § 1 ;
S. & C. 899.]
§ 5770. When widow is entitled to dower, or there is
a life estate. When a widow is entitled to dower in an
estate of which partition is sought, dower must be as
signed her therein, except in the following cases :
1. When an assignment thereof has already been made.
2. When she has, by answer, elected to be endowed
out of the proceeds of a sale of the estate, and the com
missioners do not make partition, but return a valuation
of the estate.
3. When the right of dower extends only to an undi
vided interest in the estate.
In the latter case, and in cases where an undivided
interest is subject to a life estate, and the tenant for life
has not, by answer, elected to receive the value of his
estate out of the proceeds of a sale of the interest, the
commissioners may, if an appraisement of the estate is
to be returned, assign the dower, or set off the life estate,
or, if they find it for the interest of the parties so to do,
they may appraise the whole interest, and the widow
and the tenant for life shall receive the value of their
interests out of the proceeds of a sale thereof. [29 v. 254,
§ 12; S. & C. 898.]
Dower is charged on all shares, 1 D. 527; it may be assigned
in the proceeds of sale or by assessment on the shares. 25 O. S. 270.
Where the commissioners reported the assignment of dower by
metes and bounds, and that partition of the "balance" could
not be made without manifest injury thereto, and appraised the
value "thereof" in money, it was held it would be presumed
the word " balance " referred to the estate of the parties in the entire tract of land, including the part assigned to the widow as
her dower, 39 O. S. 95. Where the husband was absent sixteen
years, the wife was held entitled to year's support from the
purchase money. 41 O. S. 436.
§ 5771. Commissioners appointed to partition estate to
assign dower. The commissioners appointed by the
court to make partition shall set off to such widow her
dower in the estate; and in the performance of such
duty they shall be governed in all respects by, and the
proceedings shall conform to, the provisions prescribing
the duties of commissioners in assigning dower, in chap
ter seven of this division. [29 v. 254, § 13 ; S. & C. 898.]
§ 5772. Power of guardian to aot for ward. The
guardian of a minor, idiot, imbecile, or insane person
may, on behalf of hia ward, do and perform any act,
matter or thing, respecting the partition of an estate
which such minor, idiot, imbecile, or insane person,
could do under this chapter, if he were of age and of
sound mind ; and he may elect on behalf of such ward
to take the estate when the same can not be divided
without injury, and make payment therefore on behalf
of such ward. [83 v. 83; 29 v. 254, §14; 48 v. 38, § 1;
S. & C. 899, 901.]
Guardian to be made party, 1 Clev. R. 157 ; can act for infant,
5 O. S. 307 ; 8 O. 415 ; may act ex parte for all under act 1820, 8 O. 415.
§ 5773. Powers of foreign guardian. A person ap
pointed according to the laws of any other state or
country, to take charge of the estate of an idiot or
insane person not a resident of this state, may, upon
being duly authorized in this state to take charge of
such estate situated in this state, act in the partition of
such estate to the same extent that the guardian of an
idiot or insane person is authorized to do by the last sec
tion. [48 v. 38, I 2 ; S. & C. 901.]
§ 6774. Actions for rents and profits by tenants in
common. Waste. One tenant in common, or coparcener,
may recover from another his share of rents and profits
received by such tenant in common or coparcener from
the estate, according to the justice and equity of the
case; and one parcener may maintain an action of waste
against another ; but no parcener shall have or possess
any privileges over another, in any election, division,
partition, or matter, to be made or done, concerning lands which have descended. [65 v. 187 ; 29 v. 254, I 15.]
Liable for using estate to pasture cattle ; not liable for inter
est without demand before suit, 46 O. S. 66.
38 O. S. 467. Married women, tenants in common, may unite
in an action to recover rent due, 42 O. S. 190. Appeal will lie
from the common pleas to the circuit court in an action by one
co-tenant against another for rents and profits, 38 O. S. 467.
§ 5775. Partition of property belonging to religious
corporations. When two or more religious denomina
tions, or other societies or associations, have united in
a corporation, and as such corporation acquire title to
real estate in this state, and subsequently agree to sep
arate and form two or more separate corporations under
the laws of the state, either corporation, after such sep
arate organization, may file its petition, under this chap
ter, for partition of such property so required and held.
[62 v. 142; S.&S.506.]
§ 5776. Partition of property belonging to religious
societies. When two or more religious societies or con
gregations have, by gift or purchase, acquired land upon
which to erect a house of public worship, and other
buildings for church or school purposes, and for a ceme
tery, in common, and either of such societies or congre
gations desires to abandon the joint use of such house of
public worship, or other erections, it may commence an
action for the partition of the use of such common prop
erty, except the cemetery, which may continue to be used
in common. [56 v. 67, § 1 ; S. & C. 371.]
§ 5777. Id. When made, and effect therecf. If the
court find that partition, in cases mentioned in the last
section, can be made in such manner as to occasion no
confusion or inconvenience to either party in the sepa
rate use of the common property, it may order partition
thereof to be made; it shall specify in the judgment for
what purpose partition of the use is made, and how and
for what purpose the use of the premises allotted to each
party shall be occupied ; and in no case shall the same
or any part thereof be occupied for any other purpose
than the erection of a house of worship, and other erec
tions connected therewith. [56 v. 67, § 2, 3, 4; S. & C.
371.]
§ 5778. Costs and expenses to be equitably taxed. The
court, having regard to the interest of the parties, and
the benefit each may derive from a partition, and according to equity, shall tax the costs and expenses which
accrue in the action, including reasonable counsel fees,
which shall be paid to plaintifff's counsel (1), unless the
court award some part thereof to other counsel for serv
ice in the case for the common benefit of all the parties ;
and execution may issue therefore as in other cases. 
§ 5779. Action to quiet title. An action may be brought
by a person in possession, by himself or tenant, of real
property, against any person who claims an estate, or in
terest therein, adverse to him, for the purpose of deter
mining such adverse estate or interest. [67 v. 116, § 557.J
Actual possession must be averred and shown, Yaple's Pr.,
etc., 773; 8 O. 382. Formerly, both title and possession, under
acts 1824, 1831 ; 1 D. 65 ; 2O.S. 540 ; 5 O. 194. The claim or inter
est must be adverse to the titte of the party in possession, but it
is not necessary that the adverse claim should relate to or affect
the right of present possession, 34 O. S. 420. Before the amend
ment, 67 v. 116, it was held that the action did not lie against a
party claiming prospectively under a contingent remainder, 19
O. S. 468. In 31 O. S. the court distinguished this case by saying
that in it defendants did not claim an interest or estate in the
land, Id. 425. The action lies to settle questions of disputed
boundary lines, 35 O. S. 597; 17 O. S. 72. 70; to determine the va
lidity of a ditch assessment, 30 O. S. 590; to reform a deed and
quiet possession, 40 O. S. 41. It may be brought by a grantor
after sale and before conveyance, 2 O. S. 540; by lessor acquiring
tax title against lessee, 8 Rec. 556; by purchaser from grantee of
state against holder of certificate of purchase guilty of laches, 42
O. S. 410; by grantee of mortgagee with consent and by verbal
agreement with mortgagor, 18 O. 273. It does not lie for a tres
pass, 34 O. S. 492, unless the acts are repeated and there are
threats to persist, 35 O. S. 597 ; nor by purchaser from vendee,
unless purchase money is tendered, 5 O. S. 211; nor to avoid a
judgment obtained without legal service where plaintifff was
not guilty of misconduct and defendant had actual knowledge
of the pendency of the action, 37 O. S. 502; nor by an heir, not
in possession, to annul the will, 31 O. S. 295; nor can it be sus
tained with respect to personalty where no title is established
at law, and it is not necessary to prevent multiplicity of suits, 4
O. 77. It will not be retained to adjust disputed questions of
title between defendants in respect to land in which plaintifff has
no interest, 29 O. S. 642. Where recovery of possession is not
sought, there is no right to a jury trial, 17 O. S. 72. On dismissal
of bill the court may quiet the title of defendants and restore
possession to them, 35 O. S. 567.
§ 5780. Vendee may recoup amount of liens and in
cumbrances. In actions for the recovery of purchase
money of real estate, by vendor against vendee, it shall
be competent for such vendee, notwithstanding his con
tinued possession, to set up, by way of counterclaim,
any breach of the covenants of title acquired by him
from the plaintifff, and to make, any person claiming an
adverse estate or interest therein party to the action ; and
upon the hearing he shall be entitled to recoup, against
the plaintifffs demand, tho present worth of any existing
lien or encumbrance thereon; and if the adverse estate
or interest of the claimant is an estate in reversion or
remainder, or contingent upon a future event, the court
may order the vendee, with his assent, to surrender the
possession to his vendor, upon the repayment of so much
of the purchase money as has been paid thereon, with
interest, or direct the payment of the purchase money
claimed in the action, upon the plaintifff giving bond in
double the amount thereof, with two or more sureties, to
be approved by the court, for the payment of the same,
with interest, if the defendant or his privies be subse
quently evicted by reason of the defect. [G7 v. 116, \ 557.]
The provisions of this act are remedial, and affect all causes of
action arising after its passage, 24 O. S. 554 ; see Id. 542. A third
person holding an outstanding title must be made defendant,
and the validity of his title established before the defense be
comes available, 28 O. S. 30. The right to bring in such third
party exists only where there has been a breach of the covenants
in the deed, 35 O. S. 289 ; generally, 2 C. C. R. 1%, 198.
§ 5781. Aotion to recover possession of real estate.
Petition. In an action for the recovery of real property,
it shall be sufficient if the plaintifff state in his petition
that he has a legal estate therein, and is entitled to the
fossession thereof, describing the same as required by
5095, and that the defendant unlawfully keeps him
out of the possession; and it shall not be necessary to
state how the plaintifff's estate or ownership is derived.
[51 v. 57, 1 558 ; S. & C. 1119.]
See I 5000, notes—Ownership or title, p. 70 ; 21 Bull 319.
§ 5782. Id. Answer. It shall be sufficient, in such
action, if the defendant in his answer deny generally the
title alleged in the petition, or that he withholds the pos
session; but if he deny the title of the plaintifff, posses
sion by the defendant shall be taken as admitted, and when he does not defend for the whole premises, the
answer shall describe the particular part for which de
fense is made, and the defendant may further set forth
in his answer such other and further grounds of defense,
counterclaim and set-off, as he has or might have in any
other form of action, whether they are such as have
heretofore been denominated legal or equitable, or both.
[80 v. 66; 51 v. 57, \ 559; S. & C. 1122.]
See I 5006, Ejectment ; § 5070, p. 103. In an answer denying
title, a plea of the statute of limitations, 29 O. S. 359; 35 O. S. 387,
and a denial that defendant wrongfully keeps plaintifff out of
possession, 37 O. S. 147, is surplusage. An equitable defense must
be specially pleaded, 36 O. S. 357. Illegality of consideration was,
before the last amendment, held no defense in an action of
ejectment upon a mortgage, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 70 ; 37 O. S. 383. Defend
ant relying solely on his legal title, and failing, is not estopped
to maintain an action to correct mistakes in the deeds under
which the parties to the action claimed. He may elect to rely
on such equitable title as a defense or counterclaim, or maintain
an action thereon, 39 O. S. 141.
§ 5783. Petition in action by tenant in common against
oo-tenant. In an action by a tenant in common of real
property against a co-tenant, the plaintifff must state, in
addition to what is required in § 5781, that the defend
ant either denied the plaintifff's right, or did some act
amounting to such denial. [51 v. 57, § 560; S. & C. 1122.]
§ 5784. The recovery when right terminates during the
action. In an action for the recovery of real property,
when the plaintifff shows a right to recover at the time
the action was commenced, but his right has terminated
during the pendency of the action, the verdict andjudgment must be according to the fact, and the plaintifff may
recover for withholding the property. [51 v. 57, § 561 ;
S.&C. 1122.]
§ 5785. Parties may have benefit of ocoupying-claimant law. Parties in an action for the recovery of real
property may avail themselves, if entitled thereto, of the
benefit of the statutes for the relief of occupying claim
ants of land. [51 v. 57, § 564 ; S. & C. 1122.]
SUBDIVISION II. OCCUPYING CLAIMANTS.
§ 5786. In what cases occupying claimants to be paid
for improvements. A person in the quiet possession of
lands or tenements, and claiming to own the same, who
has obtained title to and is in possession of the same without fraud or collusion on his part, shall not be
evicted or turned out of possession by any person who
sets up and proves an adverse and better title, until the
occupying claimant, or his heirs, are fully paid the value
of all lasting and valuable improvements made on the
land by him, or by the person under whom he holds, pre
vious to receiving actual notice by the commencement of
suit on such adverse claim, whereby such eviction may
be effected, unless such occupying claimant refuse to pay
to the person so setting up and proving an adverse and
better title the value of the land, without improvements
made thereon as aforesaid, upon demand of the success
ful claimant, or his heirs, as hereinafter provided, when :
1. Such occupying claimant holds a plain and con
nected title, in law or equity, derived from the records
of a public office ; or,
2. Holds the same by deed, devise, descent, contract,
bond, or agreement, from and under a person claiming
title as aforesaid, derived from the records of a public
office, or by deed duly authenticated and recorded; or,
3. Under sale on execution, against a person claiming
title as aforesaid, derived from the records of a public
office, or by deed duly authenticated and recorded ; or,
4. Under a sale for taxes authorized by the laws of this
state, or the laws of the territory northwest of the river
Ohio ; or,
5. Under a sale and conveyance made by executors,
administrators, or guardians, or by any other person or
persons, in pursuance of an order of court, or decree in
chancery, where lands are or have been directed to be
sold. [29 v. 261, I 1 ; S. & C. 881.]
Notice of title before improvement is a bar, 5 W. L. J. 465 ; but
an occupying claimant is not presumed to know any defects or
recitals that appear in deeds prior to the deed of his grantor;
and if a recital in tha t or his own deed shows that the premises
once belonged to a third person, it will not defeat the occupant's
claim to the benefit of the statute, 1 O. S. 118. And the mere fact
that the occupant had notice of the claim which is successfully
asserted is not conclusive evidence of fraud and collusion on the
part of such purchaser, but he may show, notwithstanding such
notice, that ne purchased in actual good faith and made his im
provements in the honest belief that the land was his own, 11
O. S. 339. To entitle a party to relief, he must be evicted by a
title both paramount and adverse. Eviction by a trustee hold
ing the legal title is not sufficient, 35 O. S. 18 ; but the facts may
be such as to entitle such evicted purchaser on cross-petition to
compensation in equity for permanent improvements made upon the premises, to be charged as a lien upon the land, Id.: see
3 O. 327. The party evicted must make his claim for the benefits
of the law in the action by which he is evicted, otherwise he
waives it, 40 O. S. 343. The benefits of the law do not extend to
an assignee of land warrant, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 200; to the heir of a pur
chaser under a fraudulent conveyance, 13 O. S. 263 ; to one in
possession under a mortgagor, but without deed from him, W.
386; see 3 O. 327; to a mortgagee of a tenant in common who
took under a will providing for survivorship, 22 O. S. 255.
1. A township trustee's office is a " public office " within the
meaning of the law, 6 O. 538.
2. A " deed duly authenticated and recorded " means a deed
to the person under whom the occupant claims, and not a deed
to the occupant, 1 O. S. 118 (overruling 19 O. 57); 13 O. 308. A
deed from purchaser's heir sufficient, 1 C. S. C. R. 83.
3. 5 O. 398.
4. See 7 O. (Pt.l)17; 8 O.539.
5. A purchaserat judicial sale is entitled to the benefits of the
law, 5 O. 398 ; 6 O. 9, and a purchaser from judgment debtor
after judicial sale and before confirmation, 4 Bull 441 ; 2 Clev. R.
201, but not a purchaser from judgment debtor after levy, 7 O.
(Pt. 2) 188.
§ 5787. Tax title gives right to benefits of ocoupyingolaimant law. The title by which the successful claimant
succeeds against the occupying claimant, in all cases of
lands sold for taxes by virtue of any law of this state,
or the laws of the territory north west of the river Ohio,
shall be considered an adverse and better title, under the
provisions of the last section, whether it be the title under
which the taxes were due, and for which the land was
sold, or any other title or claim; and the occupying
claimant holding possession of land so sold for taxes,
having the deed of a collector of taxes or county auditor
therefore, or a certificate of such sale from a collector of
taxes or a county treasurer, or claiming under the per
son who holds such deed or certificate, shall be consid
ered as having sufficient title to the land to demand the
value of improvements under the provisions of the last
section. [29 v. 261, § 2 ; S. & C. 883.]
§ 5788. Entry of claim for improvement, and drawing
jury. The court rendering judgment against the occu
pying claimant, in any case provided for by this subdi
vision, shall, at the request of either party, cause a
journal entry thereof to be made ; the sheriff and clerk
of the court, when thereafter required by either party,
shall meet, and draw from the jury box the names
of twelve men returned to serve as jurors, in the same
manner as they are required by law to draw a jury in other cases ; and immediately thereupon the clerk shall
issue an order to the sheriff, under the seal of the court,
setting forth the names of the jurors, and the duty to
be performed by them. [29 v. 261, \ 3 ; S. & C. 883.]
This is a separate proceeding, in which the prevailing party is
entitled to costs, though he be the party ejected, 1 O. 156.
§ 5789. Duties of jury. The jury named in the order
shall immediately, on being notified by the sheriff, pro
ceed to view the premises in question, and then and
there, on oath, to be administered by any competent
authority, assess the value of all lasting and valuable
improvements made on the lands previous to the party
receiving actual notice as aforesaid of the adverse claim,
and shall also assess the damages, if any, which the land
has sustained by waste, together with the net annual
value of the rents and profits of the land which the occu
pying claimant has received after having received notice
of the plaintifff's title by the service of a summons, and
deduct the amount thereof from the estimated value of
such lasting and valuable improvements; and the jury
shall also assess the value of the land at the time judg
ment was rendered, without the improvements made
thereon, or damages sustained by waste. [29 v. 261, \ 4 ;
S. & C. 883.]
The occupying claimant is entitled to recover as well for im
provements made by his grantor as by himself, 2 O. 235 ; 13 O. 308 ;
but not for improvements made outside of the land described in
his title deeds, 15 O. 13. Improvements can not be set off against
mesne profits, 8 O. 401.
§ 5790. Sheriff to summon talesmen. If any juror
named in the order is absent from the county, of kin to
either party, or from any other cause disqualified or
unable to serve upon the jury, the sheriff may summon
a talesman as in other cases, who shall be qualified and
shall serve as if originally drawn and named in the
order. [29 v. 261, § 5 ; S. & C. 884.]
§5791. Verdict. Return. Revaluation. The jury shall
sign the assessments and valuations, and deposit the same
with the clerk of the court, before the first day of the
next term of the court after the order is made ; if either
party be aggrieved by any such assessment or valuation,
he may apply to the court, at the term to which the pro
ceedings are returned ; and the court may, upon good cause shown, set aside such assessment or valuation, order
a new valuation and appoint another jury, as herein
before provided, which shall proceed in the same man
ner as hereinbefore directed. [84 v. 45; 29 v. 261, \ 6;
S. & C. 884.]
§ 5792. Judgment and execution ou verdict for plaint
iff. If the jury report a sum in favor of the plaintifff in
ejectment, on the assessment and valuation of the valu
able and lasting improvements, the assessment of dam
ages for waste, and the net annual value of the rente and
profits, the court shall render a judgment therefore, with
out pleadings, and issue execution thereon as in other
cases ; or, if no such excess be reported, then, and in
either case, the plaintifff in ejectment shall be thereby
barred from having or maintaining an action for mesne
profits. [29 v. 261, § 7 ; S. & C. 884.]
§ 5793. Proceedings when verdict is for occupying
olaimant. If the jury report a sum in favor of the occu
pying claimant, on the assessment and valuation of the
valuable and lasting improvements, deducting therefrom
the damages, if any, sustained by waste, together with
the net annual value of the rents and profits which the
defendant has received after commencement of the
action, the successful claimant, or his heirs, or, if they
are minors, their guardians, may either demand of the
occupying claimant the value of the land without the
improvements so assessed, and tender a deed of the land
to the occupying claimant, or may pay the occupying
claimant the sum so allowed by the jury in his favor,
within such reasonable time as the court shall allow.
[29 v. 261, §8; S. & C. 884.]
§ 5794. When writ of possession will issue. If the
successful claimant, his heirs, or their guardians, elect to
pay, and do pay, to the occupying claimant, the sum re
ported in his favor by the jury, within the time allowed
by the court, then a writ of possession shall issue in favor
of the successful claimant, his heirs, or their guardians.
[29 v. 261, 1 9 ; S. & C. 885.]
§ 5795. When olaimant elects to receive value of the
land. If the successful claimant, his heirs, or their
guardians, elect to receive the value of the land without
improvements, so assessed to be paid by the occupying
claimant, and tender a general warranty deed of the land conveying such adverse or better title, within the
time allowed by the court for the payment of the money,
and the occupying claimant refuse or neglect to pay the
same to the successful claimant, his heirs, or their guard
ians, within the time limited, a writ of possession shall
be issued in favor of the successful claimant, his heirs,
or their guardians. [29 v. 261, § 10 ; S. & C. 885.]
Successful claimant electing to convey must tender a war
ranty deed, 16 O. 285.
§ 3796. When occupant may have action for title. The
occupying claimant, or his heirs, shall not be evicted
from the possession of such land, except as is provided
in the two preceding sections, where an application is
made for the value of improvements; and in all cases
where the occupying claimant, or his heirs, pay into
court the value of the land, without improvements,
within the time allowed by the court, when an election
has been made by the successful claimant, his heirs, or
their guardians, to surrender land under the provisions
of this subdivision, such occupant or his heirs may, at
any time after such payment is made, bring an action in
the court where judgment of eviction was obtained, and
obtain judgment for the title of the land, if the same had
not been previously conveyed to such occupant as afore
said. [29 v. 261, §11; S. & C. 885.]
SUBDIVISION III. TO COMPLETE REAL CONTRACTS.
§ 5797. When the survivors of vendors of land maybe
authorized to convey. When two or more persons who
own an interest in land become bound in writing for the
sale and conveyance thereof, and one of them dies before
the land is conveyed, the survivor or survivors may, by
petition against the purchaser, and the heirs or devisees
of such deceased party, be authorized to complete such
contract. [29 v. 258, \ 1 ; S. & C. 259.]
§ 5798. Id. Petition. The petition must set forth the
names of all the contracting parties, describe the lands
contracted for, state the time the contract was made, that
the contract has been fully performed by the purchaser,
and have annexed a copy of the contract. [29 v. 258, jj 3 ;
S. & 0. 260.]
§ 5799. Id. Judgment. Deed. If the court find the
allegations of the petition to be true, it may make an order authorizing and empowering the survivors to com
plete the contract by conveying the land ; and the deed
shall recite the order, and shall convey as complete and
perfect a title, and have the same effect, as if executed
by all the owners. [29 v. 258, § 2 ; S. & C. 260.]
§ 5800. Action by executor, etc., to complete contract
for sale of land. When a person who has entered into a
written contract for the sale and conveyance of an inter
est in land dies before the completion thereof, and his
executor, administrator, or other legal representative,
desires to complete the contract, he may file a petition
therefore in the court of common pleas or probate court
of the county in which the land, or any part thereof, is
situate; if the petition be filed in the probate court,
service may be made therein as in civil actions; and the
heirs at law, devisees, or other legal representatives of
the deceased vendor, when not plaintifffs, must be made
defendants in the action. [29 v. 258, § 5 ; S. & C. 260.]
Formerly proceedings to complete contract of married woman
dying before execution of conveyance were void, 34 O. S. 589.
§ 5801. When court may order conveyance. Seed.
The court, after causing to be secured to and for the
benefit of the estate of the deceased its j ust part and pro
portion of the consideration of the contract, may author
ize the executor, administrator, or other legal representa
tive to complete the contract, and to execute a deed for
and on behalf of the heirs at law to the purchaser,
which shall recite the order, and be as binding on the
heirs at law, and all other persons interested, as if it had
been made by the deceased in his lifetime. [29 v. 258,
11 6, 8; S.&C.261.]
§ 5802. Heirs of deceased purchaser may enforce specific
performance. The heirs at law, or devisees, of a person
who purchased an interest in land by written contract,
and died before conveyance thereof to him, may compel
such conveyance as the deceased might have done. [29
v. 258, § 7 ; S. & C. 261.]
See H 5005, 5006, 5060, notes—Specific performance.
SUBDIVISION IV. TO SELL ENTAILED AND OTHER ESTATES.
§ 5803. Who may obtain a sale of entailed and certain
other estates. Courts of common pleas, in an action by
the tenant in tail or for life, or by the grantee or devisee of a qualified or conditional fee, or of any other quali
fied, conditional, or determinable interest, or by a person
claiming under such tenant, grantee, or devisee, or by
the trustees or beneficiaries, if the estate is held in trust,
may authorize the sale of any estate, w hether the same
was created by will, deed, or contract, or came by de
scent, when satisfied that a sale thereof would be for the
benefit of the person holding the first and present estate,
interest, or use, and do no substantial injury to the heirs
in tail, or others in expectancy, succession, reversion, or
remainder ; but this section shall not extend to estates in
dower or by curtesy. [56 v. 154, $ 1 ; 61 v. 80, % 1, 2;
62 v. 184, ?1 ; S. & C. 550 ; S. & S. 346, 347.]
These acts are constitutional as to estates created after their
passage, 33 O. S. 213, 308, but not before 25 O. S. 283. The owner
of a life estate in possession created by will subsequent to April
13, 1865, may institute proceedings for the sale of both the life
estate and the estate in remainder, 33 O. S. 213.
§ 5804, Id, Requisites of petition. Parties. The pe
tition shall contiin a description of the estate to be
sold, a clear statement of the interest of the plaintifff
therein, and a copy (1) of the will, deed, or other instru
ment of writing by which the estate is created ; all per
sons in being who are interested in the estate, or who
may, by the terms of the will, deed, or other instrument
creating the entailment or other estate, thereafter become
interested therein as heir, reversioner, or otherwise, shall
be made parties to the petition ; and if the names of any
persons who ought to be made parties are unknown to
the plaintifff, or if the residence of any such party is
unknown to the plaintifff, the fact shall be verified by the
affidavit of the plaintifff, and the sale may be ordered
notwithstanding such names and residences are unknown.
[56 v. 154, I 2 ; S. & C. 550.]
1. Omission not ground of error when not objected to below,
33 O. S. 308.
§ 5805. Order for sale and effect of sale. If, upon the
hearing of the petition, it may be made to appear to the
court, by satisfactory proof, that a sale of the estate
would be for the benefit of the tenant in tail or for life,
and do no substantial injury to the heirs in tail, or
others in expectancy, succession, reversion, or remainder,
the court shall direct a sale of the estate to be made, and the manner thereof, and shall appoint some suitable per
son or persons to make the same ; and such sale shall vest
the estate sold in the purchaser, freed from the entail
ment, limitation, or condition. [56 v. 154, \ 3; S. & C.
551.]
§ 5806. Sale may lie had by consent. All parties in
interest may appear voluntarily, and consent in writing
to such sale ; and testamentary guardians, and guardians
appointed by the court of probate, may assent, in the place
of their wards, to the sale. [56 v. 154, § 4 ; S & C. 551.]
§ 5807. Report and confirmation of sale. Deed. All
such sales shall be reported to the court authorizing the
same ; and if, on examination thereof, it appear that the
sale was fairly conducted and made, and that the price
obtained is the reasonable value of the estate sold, the
court shall confirm the sale, and direct a deed of convey
ance of the premises sold to be made to the purchaser,
on payment of the purchase money or on securing the
payment thereof in such manner as shall be approved
by the court. [56 v. 154, § 5 ; S. & C. 551.]
§ 5808. How proceeds of sale disposed of. All money
arising from sales under this subdivision shall, for pur
poses of descent, succession, reversion, or remainder, have
the same character, and be governed by the same prin
ciples, as the estate sold, and shall pass according to the
terms of the deed, will, or other instrument creating the
estate. [56 v. 154, § 6 ; 61 v. 80, § 1 ; S. & C. 551 ; S. &
S. 346.]
§ 5809. How proceeds may be invested. Money arising
from such sales shall, under the direction and approval
of the court, be invested in the certificates of the funded
debt of this state or of the United States, or in bonds
secured by mortgage on unincumbered real estate situate
in the proper county of double the value of the money
secured thereby, exclusive of buildings and other im
provements, and of timber, mines, and minerals; or the
court may order the same to be re-invested in other real
estate within this state, under such restrictions as it may
prescribe, which investment shall be reported to the
court, and subject to its approval and confirmation ; the
real estate in which the money is re-invested shall, for
purposes of descent, succession, reversion, or remainder,
have the same character, and be governed by the same principles, as the estate sold, and shall pass according to
the terms of the deed, will, or other instrument creating
the estate sold ; the court shall appoint competent trus
tees to invest the money, and manage the same, who
shall, from time to time, report to the court their pro
ceedings, and the condition of the fund: and the court
shall require of such trustees security for the faithful
discharge of their duty ; may, from time to time, require
additional security ; may remove such trustees for cause,
or reasonable apprehension thereof ; and may accept the
resignation of a trustee, and fill a vacancy by a new ap
pointment. [57 v. 25, § 7 ; S. & C. 551.]
§ 5810. Who to receive income and pay taxes and ex
penses. The net income accruing from sales authorized
by this subdivision shall be paid to the person or persons
who would be entitled to the use or income of the estate
were the same unsold ; and all taxes, and the expenses of
the investment and management of the fund, shall be
paid by the person or persons entitled to the income
thereof. [56 v. 154, § 8 ; S. & C. 551.]
§ 5811. Such estates may be leased. Upon like pro
ceedings the court may direct that such estates be leased
for a term of years, renewable or otherwise, as may ap
pear most beneficial, and upon such terms as appear just
and equitable ; and the rents and profits shall be paid to
the person or persons who might otherwise be entitled to
the use and occupancy of the estate, or the income
thereof. [56 v. 154, § 9 ; S. & C. 552.]
§ 5812. Sale of property given for religious use. When
any real estate, except burial grounds or a cemetery, has
been donated, bequeathed, or otherwise entrusted to, or
purchased by, any person or trustee, for any public re
ligious use, but not to or for the use of any specific or par
ticular religious society or denomination, or when the
same has been donated, bequeathed, or entrusted to, or
purchased by, a particular religious society or denom
ination, and has been abandoned for such use, the court
of common pleas of the county in which the same is
located may, upon good cause shown, upon the petition
of any citizen of the vicinity, make an order for the sale
of such property, whether the same has been built upon
or otherwise improved or not, and may make such order
as to costs, and such disposition of the proceeds of the sale to such religious or other public use, as shall be just
proper, and eauitable ; and the purchaser thereof shall
be invested with as full and complete a title thereto as
the character of the original grant for such religious use
will allow. [66 v. 126, $ 1, 2.]
§ 5813. Necessary parties to the proceeding. All per
sons who have a vested, contingent, or reversionary in
terest in such real estate, and the trustees or other tem
poral officers of any religious society then using the

Sales of church property by religious corporations, etc.;
§ 5814. When possession of personal property may be
recovered. The possession of specific personal property
may be recovered in an action as provided in this chap
ter. [51 v. 57, § 174 ; S. & C. 996.]
Pteading. Plaintiff must allege an interest in himself ; a gen
eral ownership is sufficient, 26 O. S. 659; a right to immediate
possession, 5 O. 93; 2 O. S. 82; unlawful detention on the part
of defendant, 2 O. S. 82, and ask for an order of delivery, \ 5816,
and damages, \ 5825. A plea of non detinet under the common
law practice put both defendant's right of property and dam
ages in issue, 12 O. 112. A general denial under the code puts
in issue every material allegation of the petition, and defendant
may give evidence of any special matter which amounts to a
defense, 2 Bates PI., etc., 909. Appeal will lie from justice irre
spective of amount claimed or recovered, 12 O. S. 548. Sheriff,
. under a general denial, may make any defense he has, and un
der it prove his writ and levy ou the goods in controversy, 11
Bull 225; see 45 O. S. 657; 19 Bull 245. Injunction to prevent
defendant's disposal of property, 1 Bull 234.
The action lies for money, if identifiable, 3 Bull 1122, for ex
empt property when levied" on, 2 Clcv. R. 129. It lies by a chat

§ 5820. Duty of officer when property consists of heir
looms, etc When the property replevied consists of an
heirloom, personal keepsake, or other article, the value
of which consists in whole or in part of its being a relic,
model, gift, family picture, painting, or rare production
of art or nature, and not wholly in its general market
able character, the sheriff shall retain and safely keep
the same, subject to the order of the court, if the defend
ant, his agent or attorney, within ten days after the same
is replevied, serve a written notice upon the officer that
he will demand the return of the same upon the final
trial of the case, and that he will, at the next term of
the court, move for an order requiring the officer to re
tain the property, subject to the final order of the court;
and if the defendant fail to give the notice aforesaid, or the court, upon application of either party, refuse to
order the officer to retain the property, for the reason
that it does not belong to one or more of the kinds of
personal property aforesaid, the officer shall deliver the
property to the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, upon the
execution of an undertaking, as provided in the last sec
tion, to be filed with the clerk of the court within ten
days from the expiration of the time to give the notice,
or in case the notice is given within ten days after the
refusal of the court to order the officer to retain the
property. [65 v. S1, \ 179 ; S. & S. 546.]

liability. If the undertaking required by f 5819 be not
given within twenty-four hours after the property is

to the defendant ; and if the officer deliver any property
so taken to the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, or keep
the same from the defendant, without taking such secu
rity within the time and in the manner aforesaid, or if
he take insufficient security, he shall be liable in dama
ges. [67 v. 112, § 181.]
§ 5823. Qualifications of sureties. Exceptions to suf
ficiency. The defendant may, within twenty-four hours
from the time the undertaking referred to in the last
section is given by the plaintifff, give notice to the sheriff
that he excepts to the sufficiency of the surety, and if he

jections to them ; when the defendant excepts, the surety
must justify upon notice, as bail on arrest; the officer
shall be responsible for the sufficiency of his surety until
the objection thereto is waived as above provided, or
until they justify ; and the property shall be delivered to
the plaintifff when the undertaking required by § 5819

demurrer, or he fails to prosecute his action to final
judgment, the court shall, on application of defendant,
assess to defendant proper damages, including damages
for the right of property or possession, or both, if he
prove himself entitled thereto, or cause the same to be

§ 183; S.&S. 547.]
§ 5825. Proceedings when jury finds for plaintifff, and
on default. When the property is delivered to the plaint
iff, or remains in the hands of the sheriff, as provided in
§ 5820, if the jury, upon issue joined, find for the plaint
iff, and upon inquiry of damages upon a default, they
shall assess adequate damages to the plaintifff for the
illegal detention of the property, for which, with costs
of suit, the court shall render judgment for the plaintifff.
[51 v. 57, 1 185 ; 65 v. 81, \ 184 ; S. & C. 1001 ; S. & S. 548.]
See § 6622.
§ 5826. Proceedings when jury finds for defendant.
When the property is delivered to the plaintifff, or re
mains in the hands of the sheriff, as provided in \ 5820,
if the jury, upon issue joined, find for the defendant,
they shall also find whether the defendant had the right
of property, or the right of possession only (1), at the
commencement of the suit; and if they find either in
his favor, they shall assess to him such damages (2) as
they think right and proper, for which, with costs of
suit, the court shall render judgment for the defendant.
[65 v. 81, § 184; S. & S. 548.]
1. 7 O. (Pt. 2) 232. A judgment without such finding is erroueous, 12 O. S. 432. Where issues are made upon inconsistent
pleas, a general verdict for the defendant upon all is bad, 7 O.
(Pt. 2) 232. Finding property in defendant is good, though prop
erty was in defendant and another, W 645. 2. W. 645. It is er
ror to assess defendant's damages without the intervention of a
jury, 12 O. S. 432; but in an action before a justice, if no jury is
demanded, the justice may assess the damages, 26 O. S. 480.
When property which he holds in execution is replevied from
the sheriff; and the issue is found for the defendant, the measure
of damages is the amount of the execution, with interest and
costs if the value of the property exceeds it, and the value of the
property if it is less than that amount, 17 O. 154. In replevin for
several articles, when the jury find for the plaintifffas to part and
for the defendant as to part, assessing to each the proper dama
ges separate judgments should be entered for each, with full
costs, 9 O. 72. Notice to plaintifff of jury trial, 45 O. S. 659.
§ 5827. When property not taken or returned, action
may proceed as one for damages. When the property
claimed is not taken, or is returned to the defendant by
the sheriff for want of the undertaking required by
§ 5819, the action may proceed as one for damages only,
and the plaintifff shall be entitled to such damages aa
are right and proper; but if the property be returned
for want of the undertaking, the plaintifff shall pay all
costs made by taking the same. [51 v. 57, § 186 ; S. & C.
1001.]
When the property has been returned the action may pro
ceed, and plaintifff may recover to the extent of his interest in
the property without any amendment of the pleadings, 10
§ 5828. Order for delivery may issue to different coun
ties. An order for the delivery of the property claimed
may be directed to any county ; and several orders may
issue at the same time, or successively, at the option of
the plaintifff, but only one of them shall be taxed in the
costs, unless otherwise ordered by the court. [51 v. 57,
§ 187 ; S. & C. 1001.]
{i 5829. When officer may break open building. The
officer, in the execution of the order of delivery, may
break open any building or enclosure in which the prop
erty claimed, or any part thereof, is concealed, but not
until he has been refused an entrance into the building
or enclosure, and the delivery of the propertv, after hav
ing demanded the same. [51 v. 57, § 188 ; H. & C. 1001.]
§ 5830. When action may he brought on the under
taking. No suit shall be instituted on the undertaking
given under § 5819 until an execution issued on a judg
ment in favor of the defendant in the action has been
returned unsatisfied. [51 v. 57, § 189 ; S. & C. 1001.]
§ 5831. When order may be set aside at clerk's cost.
An order for the delivery of property issued under
§ 5815, without the affidavit required thereby, shall be
set aside at the cost of the clerk who issued it, and such
clerk, as well as the plaintifff, shall be liable in damages
to the party injured. [51 v. 57, 1 190 ; S. & C. 1001.]
§ 5832. Certain sureties can not waive their rights.
In contracts for the payment of money to banks or bank
ers, sureties in fact, known to the parties to be buch at
the time such contracts were made, may be proved, and
shall be considered in all courts, to be sureties, and have
all the privileges of sureties, anything in the contract
expressed to the contrary notwithstanding. [43 v. 67.]
20 Bull 102.
§ 5833. Certain sureties may require creditors to sue.
A person bound as surety in a written instrument for
the payment of money, or other valuable thing, may, if
a right of action accrue thereon, require his creditor, by
notice in writing, to commence an action on such instru
ment forthwith, against the principal debtor ; and unless
the creditor commence such action within a reasonable
time thereafter, and proceed with due diligence, in the
ordinary course of law, to recover judgment against the
principal debtor for the money or other valuable thing
due thereby, and to make, by execution, the amount
thereof, the creditor, or the assignee of such instrument,
so failing to comply with the requisition of such surety,
shall thereby forfeit the right which he would otherwise
have to demand and receive of such surety the amount
due thereon. [61 v. 19, ? 1 ; S. & S. 741.]
The notice must be in writing, 41 O. S. 28, and pleaded, 7 O.
(Pt. 1) 229. No particular form or words are required. A sub
stantial compliance with the statute is sufficient, 41 O. S. 28 ; 44
O. S. 4JiO. A notice which is positive in its request to sue, and
does not mislead the creditor as to the instrument to be sued on,
is sufficient, Id. A notice, "You are hereby required at once to
proceed and collect the note you hold upon which I am surety.
... I will stand no longer," is sufficient, 40 O. S. 101. The no
tice must contain an unconditional requirement to commence
the action forthwith. A notice that the surety " wishes " the
creditor " to proceed against the principal debtor" and collect
"the claim, or have it arranged in some way," and that the
surety does " not wish to remain bail any longer," is not suffi
cient, 29 O. S. 663. The duty of the creditor to proceed within a
reasonable time after such notice is imperative. It is the right
of the surety to require that action be brought against the
principal and diligently proceeded with ; and this right is not
affected by the fact of solvency or insolvency of such principal,
44 O. S. 430. Where the principal and surety are residents within
the same jurisdiction, the duty of the creditor to commence an
action, as required, is not affected by the fact that he is a resident of another state, Id. To entitle the surety upon a note to
the benefit of this section, it is not necessary that the fact of
suretyship should appear upon the face of the note, Id. Under
a similar statute it was held that when the surety gave notice to
the creditor to sue, it was not a compliance with the statute to
sue the surety alone, 2 O. 303.
§ 5834. Representatives of sureties may have benefit
of last section. The executor or administrator of a surety
so bound may, in like manner, make such requisition of
the creditor, or his executor or administrator, as pro
vided in the preceding section ; and in case of failure of
the creditor, or his executor or administrator, to proceed
as therein required, the executor or administrator, if he
make the requisition, shall have the same relief as is
therein provided for a surety. [61 v. 19, \ 2 ; S. & S. 741.]
41 O. S. 28.
§ 5835. Limitation of the last two sections. Nothing
in the last two sections contained shall be so construed
as to affect bonds required by law to be given by guard
ians, executors, administrators, trustees of an express
trust, public officers, or any bond or undertaking required
by law to be given in an action or legal proceeding in
any court of this state. [61 v. 19, \\ 3, 4 ; S. & S. 742.]
§ 5836. When surety subrogated and may revive judg
ment in his own name. When the surety in a judgment,
who is certified therein to be such, or his personal repre
sentative, pays the judgment, or any part thereof, he
shall, to the extent of such payment, have all the rights
and remedies against the principal debtor that the
plaintifff had at the time of such payment; and proceed
ings to revive the judgment shall be as provided in
§ 5367, and shall be in the name of such surety or repre
sentative, but the plaintifff in the original action shall
not be liable for any costs therein. [78 v. 19 ; 68 v. 17, \ 1.]
The section is constitutional, 36 O. S. 155.
§ 5837. Sureties of county officers may apply to be dis
charged, A surety of a sheriff, auditor, probate judge,
county treasurer, clerk of the court of common pleas, re
corder, or coroner, may at any time notify the county
commissioners, by giving at least five days' written no
tice, that he is unwilling to continue as surety for such
officer, and will, at a time to be therein named, make
application to the commissioners further liability upon his bond j and he shall also give
at least three days' written notice to such officer of the
time and place at which such application will be made.
[62 v. 69, 1 1 ; S. & S. 742.]
§ 5838. Duty of commissioners in such case. The
county commissioners, upon such notice being given,
shall hear the application, and if, in their opinion, there
is good reason therefore, shall require such officer to give
a new bond, conditioned according to law, to their satis
faction, within such reasonable time as they may direct;
and if such officer fail to execute such bond, the office
shall be deemed vacant, and shall be immediately filled
as other vacancies therein; but such original sureties
shall not be released or discharged until the filing of the
new bond, or the expiration of the time allowed therefore,
and shall be liable only for the official acts of such offi
cer from the time of the execution of the original bond
to the filing of the second bond, or the expiration of the
time allowed therefore ; and the costs of such application
shall be paid by the surety who makes the same. [62 v.
69, § 2; S.&S.742.]
§ 5839. Sureties of constable or marshal may apply to
be discharged. If a constable, or the marshal of a mu
nicipal corporation, neglect or refuse, on demand made
for that purpose by a person entitled thereto, his agent
or attorney, to pay all money by him received in his of
ficial capacity for the use of such person, a surety of
such constable or marshal may give notice to the trustees
of the township, or the council of the corporation, in
which such constable or marshal resides, of his refusal
or neglect to pay over money by him collected by virtue
of his office, and that he is unwilling to continue as his
surety. [61 v. 103, § 1 ; S. & S. 743.]
§ 5840. Proceedings by council or trustees in such
oases. The trustees or council, as the case may be, upon
such notice being given, shall immediately inform the
constable or marshal, in writing, of the refusal of his
surety to continue as such, and that he is required to
give a new undertaking, conditioned according to law ;
if such constable or marshal give such undertaking, to
the satisfaction of the trustees or council, within ten
days after receiving such notice, the sureties upon the
first undertaking shall be released and exonerated from all further liability thereon; and if the constable or
marshal fail to give a new undertaking within ten days
after having received such written notice, such failure
shall be deemed and taken as a resignation of his office,
and the trustees or council shall proceed to fill such va
cancy as is provided in other cases. [61 v. 103, \ 2 ;
S. & a 743.]
§ 5841. Sureties of treasurer of school fund may apply
to bo discharged. A surety of the treasurer of school
funds, in any school district organized under the provis
ions of law, may at any time notify the board of educa
tion of the proper district, by giving at least five days'
notice, in writing, that he is unwilling to continue as
surety for such treasurer, and will, at a time therein
named, make application to the board of education to be
released from further liability upon his bond ; and he
shall also give at least three days' notice in writing to
such treasurer, of the time and place at which the appli
cation will be made. [70 v. 195, § 48.]
§ 5842. Proceedings by board of education in such case.
The board of education, upon such notice being given,
shall hear the application, and if, in their opinion, there
is good reason therefore, shall require the treasurer to give
a new bond, conditioned according to law, and to the
satisfaction of the board, within such time as they may
direct; and if the Ireasurer fail to execute such bond,
the office shall be deemed vacant, and shall be immedi
ately filled as other vacancies therein; but such original
sureties shall not be released or discharged until the fil-f
ing of the new bond, or the expiration of the time
allowed therefore; and the costs of such application
shall be paid by the person making the same. [70 v.
195, §48.]
§ 5843. Sureties of township officers may apply to be
discharged. A surety of a justice of the peace, constable,
township treasurer, or any township officer, may at any
time notify the township trustees, by giving at least five
days' notice, in writing, that he is unwilling to continue
as surety for such officer, and will, at a time therein
named, make application to the township trustees to be
released from further liability upon his bond ; and he
shall also give at least three days' notice in writing to
such officer, of the time and place at which the applica
§ 5844. Proceedings by township trustees in such cases.
The township trustees, upon such notice being given,
shall hear the application, and if they find that such of
ficer neglects or refuses, on demand by a person entitled
thereto, his agent or attorney, to pay over all money by
him received in his official capacity for the use of such
person, or if, in their opinion, there is other good reason
therefore, they shall require such officer to give a new
bond, conditioned according to law, and to the satisfac
tion of the trustees, within such time as they may direct;
and if the officer fail to execute such bond, the office
shall be deemed vacant, and shall be immediately filled
as other vacancies therein; but such original sureties
shall not be released or discharged until the filing of the
new bond, or the expiration of time allowed therefore,
but they shall be liable only for the official acts of such

§ 5846. When surety may have action for indemnity
before debt due. A surety may maintain an action
against his principal, to obtain indemnity against the
debt or liability for which he is bound, before it is due,
whenever any of the grounds exist upon which, by the
provisions of this title, an order mav be made for arrest
or for an attachment. [51 v. 57, I 501 ; S. & C. 1097.]

§ 5848. Jurisdiction of common pleas and superior
oourts. Courts of common pleas and superior courts
shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the illegal levy of taxes
and assessments, or the collection of either, and of actions
to recover back such taxes or assessments as have been

Superior Court of Cincinnati has jurisdiction, 25 O. S. 229,

the same extent as such courts are or may be authorized
or empowered to correct errors, mistakes, or defects in
the deeds or conveyances of any other persons. [54 v.
199, § 1 ; S. 4 C. 694.]
11O. S.641; 13 O. S.565 ; 20 O. S. 478 ; 26 O.S.153; 36O.S.549;

§ 5873. Testimony may be perpetuated. The testimony

[51 v. 57, 1 363 ; S. & C. 1047.]
§5874. Id. Petition. The applicant shall file in the
office of the clerk of the court of common pleas a peti
tion, to be verified, in which shall be set forth, specifically,
the subject matter relative to which testimony is to be

rogatories to be propounded to each ; that the applicant
expects to be a party to an action in a court in this state,
or is a party to an action already commenced, in which

stayed by proceedings in error, that such testimony will,
as he believes be material in the trial of said action, and when the applicant expects to be the plaintifff, the obsta
cles preventing the immediate commencement of the
action. [77 v. 195 ; 51 v. 57, § 364 ; S. & C. 1047.]

[51 v. 57, § 365 ; S. & C. 1047.]
§ 5876. Id. Cross-interrogatories. When it appears
satisfactorily to the court or judge that the parties in
terested can not be personally notified, such court or

§ 5878. Approval and effect of same. The court or
judge, if satisfied that the depositions have been prop

[51 v. 57, § 368; S. & C. 1047.]
§ 5879. Applicant to pay costB. The applicant shall
pay the costs of all proceedings under this chapter. [51
v. 57, \ 369 ; S. & C. 1047.]
§ 5880. What liabilities shall constitute a lien. Any
steamboat, or other watercraft, navigating the waters
within or bordering upon this state, shall be liable,
and such liability shall be a lien thereon, for all debts
contracted on account thereof by the master, owner,
steward, consignee, or other agent, for materials, sup
plies, or labor in the building, repairing, furnishing, or
equipping of the same, or for insurance, or due for
wharfage, and also for damages arising out of any con
tract for the transportation of goods or persons, or for
injuries done to persons or property by such craft, or for
any damage or injury done by the captain, mate, or
other officer thereof, or by any person under the order or
sanction of either of them, to any person who is a pas
senger or hand on such steamboat or other watercraft, at
the time of the infliction of such damage or injury. [78
v. 228 ; 57 v. 32, §1 ; S. & C. 252.]
Watercraft is liable for materials furnished in its construc
tion, 23 O.S. 566; labor in building, 18 O. 187 (but not for building
when in hands of purchaser, 16 O. 276 ; see 15 O. 585); repairs, W.
£60 ; stationery and printing for boat, but not newspaper adver
tisements, 7 O. S. 457 ; liable for hire of barge, 7 O. S. 478 , wages of
seamen, 12 O. 341 ; on contract for carriage, 17 O. 460; 16 O. S. 98
(but not for future carriage, 20 O. 54; 3 O. S. 325); supplies and
debts contracted therefore, 11 O. 458 ; 1 C. S. C. R. 27, but not for sup
plies furnished outside of the state, 16 O. 178, nor for those fur
nished by a firm a member of which owned the boat, 2 O. S. 26 :
nor on executory contract therefore, 7 O. S. 377; nor for money
loaned to pay for supplies, etc., 20 O.62 ; 3 O. S. 325 ; nor for assault
and battery committed by officers, 13 O. S. 255, out of the state, 10
O. S. 582 ; 11 O. S. 37!i ; nor on maritime contracts, 28 O. S. 002 ; 25
O. S. 390 ; 18 O. S. 521 ; 1 C. S. C. R. 27, and these include, accord
ing to present rulings, contracts for repairs orsupplies furnished
to a boat at her home port, 28 O. S. 002 ; see 25 O. S. 390 ; a contract
to transport passengers from Louisville to Cincinnati, 18 O. S.
521. Of maritime contracts the United States courts have exclu
sive jurisdiction saving the rights of suitors to pursue commonlaw remedies, 28 O. S. 602 ; 18 O. S. 521 ; 21 Wall 558, overruling 2
O. S. 26, 142 ; 3 O. S. 105 ; and a proceeding in rem for the breach
-of a maritime contract is not within the saving clause and can
only be brought in the United States District Court, 28 O. S. 602;
but no maritime lien arises on a contract for repairs or supplies furnished to a boat at her home port. It is thereforee competent
for the states, in such cases, to create liens therefore and provide
remedies for their enforcement not inconsistent with the exclu
sive jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, 28 O. S. 602. Purchaser
at private sale takes subject to "liens. 14 O. 408, and mortgagee.
14 O. 72: 17 O. 359; but purchaser at judicial sale takes title di
vested of liens and liabilities, 14 O. 408. There is no exemption
in lieu of homestead under this chapter, 27 O. S. 517.
§ 5881. When the liability arises out of the state. If
a liability, as provided in the last section, arise beyond
the jurisdiction of this state, a lien therefore shall attach,
and may be enforced as provided in this chapter, except
against purchasers without notice. [46 v. 78, ? 1 ; S. & C.
256.]
§ 6882. The craft owner or master may be proceeded
against. A person having a demand, as provided in
§ 5880, may proceed against the owner of the craft, or
the master wno contracted the debt, or against the craft
itself. [38 v. 34, ? 2 ; S. & C. 254.]
§ 5883. Petition against craft by name. Such person
may file a petition as in a civil action, in the court of
common pleas of the proper county, against the craft by
name, or, if it does not have a name, by a pertinent and
substantial description of the same. [61 v. 18, ? 3;
S. & S. 93.]
§ 5884. Summons and warrant for seizure to issue.
On the filing of the petition the clerk shall issue a sum
mons, as in other cases, with a warrant returnable as
other writs, directing the sheriff to seize the craft, or such
part of her apparel or furniture as may be necessary to
satisfy the demand, and to detain the same until dis
charged by due course of law ; and the officer who exe
cutes the writ shall return it, with an inventory of the
effects seized and held under it. [61 v. 18, § 4; S. & S.
93.]
§ 5885. Expenses to be advanced before seizure. The
officer holding the warrant may require the plaintifff
to deposit with him such sum of money as he deems
reasonable and necessary to defray all necessary expenses
in taking charge of, detaining, and securing the prop
erty; but in no case shall the officer pay to any person
employed by him for such purpose more than two dol
lars per day for the time actually employed. [41 v. 51,
?2 1, 2; S.& C.256, 257.]
§ 5886. Excels of money advanced to be repaid. The
officer shall return an account of the expenses incurred
by him under the last section; and if the amount de
posited with him be greater than the sum by him ex
pended, he shall pay the balance in his hands to the
plaintifff, and if it be less than that sum, the plaintifff
shall forthwith pay him the balance. [41 v. 51, \ 3;
S.&C.257.]
§ 5887. How property seized may be discharged. The
owner, master, steward, consignee, or other agent of such
craft, may discharge the property seized by delivering to
the officer who made the seizure an undertaking, with
two sufficient sureties, resident of the county, payable to
the plaintifff, in double the amount of his demands as
stated in the petition, conditioned that the property shall
be forthcoming to answer the judgment under the seizure.
[38 v. 34, §5; S. & C. 254.]
The bond is not binding unless the court had jurisdiction, 37
O. S. 682. It does not extinguish the officer's right to retake, 5
O. S. 201. The craft may be seized by others for subsequent lia
bilities, and they have preference, 14 O. S. 353. In such case, the
bond is a substitute for the craft, 15 O. S. 292.
§ 5888. If action be commenced without cause, defend
ant may have damages. If an action be commenced un
der this chapter without reasonable or probable cause,
the person commencing such action shall be liable to
make compensation to the defendant for all damage

if appearing and defending, and damaged as aforesaid,
shall set forth in his answer, or in a written statement,
if the cause be pending before a justice of the peace, that
such action was commenced without reasonable or proba
ble cause, to the damage of the defendant ; and if, on
the trial, it be found that such action was commenced
without reasonable or probable cause, the damage sus
tained by the defendant shall be assessed, and for the
amount so assessed judgment shall be rendered and exe
cution issued as in other cases. [38 v. 34, § 8 ; S. & C. 255.]
§ 5889. Service and judgment. The return of the
warrant showing a seizure of property shall be equiva
lent to service; if the judgment be for the plaintifff, the
property held may be sold on the order of the court, and
the surplus money shall be returned to the owner, mas
ter, or agent on demand ; and if the judgment be against the plaintifff, the property seized shall be restored, and
judgment for costs entered against him, upon which exe
cution may issue as in other cases. [38 v. 34, § 6;
S. & C. 255.]
§ 5890. Notice of sale by officer. The officer holding
a writ for the sale of any craft, her apparel or furniture,
shall, before he proceeds to sell the same, cause public
notice to be given of the time and place of sale, for at
least ten days previous thereto, by advertisement in a
newspaper published in the county, or if no newspaper
is published therein, then in a newspaper of general cir
culation in-the county, and by advertisements posted in
at least five public places in the county ; and such sale
shall be conducted in all other respects, and the court
shall have the same power thereover, as sales upon exe
cution. [49 v. 101 ; S. & C. 257.]
See 1 5880, notes.
(S 5891. Owner or master liable for balance. If the.
proceeds of the sale do not satisfy the judgment, the owner
of the craft, or master who contracted the debt, or in
curred the liability, shall be liable in a civil action for
the balance. [38 v. 34, \ 6 ; S. & C. 255.]
§ 5892. Jurisdiction of justices. Justices of the peace
within their respective counties shall have jurisdiction
under this chapter when the amount claimed does not
exceed three hundred dollars, and shall proceed as near
as may be according to the rules prescribed herein for
other courts; but the bill of particulars of the plaintifff
shall be verified by his affidavit. [72 v. 167, \ 7.]
Formerly limited to one hundred dollars, 7 O. S. 261 . Plaintiff
not limited to amount named in bill of particulars, 18 O. 375.
§ 5893. Appeals from judgment of justice. Parties to
any such action before a justice of the peace shall have
the same right of appeal as in other cases ; and if the
judgment be against the craft by name or description,
the owner, master, steward, consignee, or other agent,
may appeal therefrom by entering into bond as in other
cases. [38 v. 34, § 10; S. & C. 255.]
§ 5894. Disposition of property after appeal. If the
plaintifff appeal, and perfect the appeal, the officer who
seized the property shall retain the same, unless it be
discharged as provided in § 5887 ; if the defendant appeal, and the appeal be perfected, the officer, on receiv
ing the certificate of the justice of that fact, shall restore
the property. [38 v. 34, § 10 ; S. & C. 255.]
§ 6707. What is a final order. An order affecting a
substantial right in an action, when such order in effect
determines the action and prevents a judgment, and an
order affecting a substantial right made in a special pro
ceeding, or upon a summary application in an action
after judgment, is a final order which may be vacated,
modified, or reversed, as provided in this title. [51 v. 57,
§ 512.]

W. L. M. 600; dismissal of appeal is, 10 O. S. 023, and order va
cating dismissal is, 12 O. S. 136.

Reversal of judgment. When the common pleas reverses a
judgment of a justice of the peace or probate court and retains
the case for t rial, the judgment of reversal is not a final order,
12 O. 216; 39 O. 8. 170; contra, where the judgment of the com
mon pleas or superior court is reversed and the cause remanded
for further proceedings. Error will lie to reverse the judgment
of reversal while the cause is still pending in the court to which,
it has been so remanded, 17 O. S. 183; 21 O. S. 620; see 22 Id. 118;
but a judgment of the district court reversing the judgment of
the common pleas with costs, and remanding the cause to the
common pleas for execution , is not a final order, 42 O. S. 445.
Since the act of April 18, 1883 (80 v. 169), the supreme court has
had no power to reverse a judgment of the district court revers
ing a judgment of the common pleas and remanding the cause
for a new trial on the merits, 44 O. 9. 438. This act was repealed
and supplied by the amendment of February 7, 1885 (82 v. 36),
and the latter repealed and supplied by the amendment of May
4, 1885 (82 V. 230).

and an order defeating a sale, 35 O. S. 430, and a decree for sale

ajjpeal, 7 O. S. 233 ; striking out part of answer is not, 6 O. S.
Taxes. Order of common pleas in application to redeem land
sold for taxes is, 3 O. 277 ; appeal did not lie in such case, Id. 301.
§ 6708. Jurisdiction of common pleas in error. A
judgment rendered or final order made by a probate court, justice of the peace, or any other tribunal, board,
or officer exercising judicial functions, and inferior in
jurisdiction to the court of common pleas, may be re
versed, vacated, or modified by the court of common
pleas. [51 v. 57, § 511 ; S. '& C. 1099.]
Error lies from a judgment of the common pleas reversing a
judgment of conviction in mayor's court, 40 O. S. 253. A judg
ment of a justice of the peace in forcible entry and detainer is
judgment within the meaning of this section, 10 O. S. 318. The
refusal of the common pleas to allow a petition in error, in such
proceeding, is not reviewable in the district court on a petition
in error, 42 O. S. 249. An order of a justice overruling a motion
to discharge an attachment is reviewable on error, 42 O. S. 102.
§ 6709. Jurisdiction of oirouit court in error. A judg
ment rendered, or final order made, by the common
pleas court, may be reversed, vacated, or modified by
the circuit court, for errors appearing on the record ;
all errors assigned in the petition in error shall be passed
upon by the court, and in every case where a judgment
or order is reversed and remanded for a new trial or
hearing, the circuit court shall, in its mandate to the
court below, state the error or errors found in the record
upon which the judgment of reversal is based. [82 v.
36 ; 51 v. 57, § 513 ; S. & C. 1100.]
Error did not lie from the district court in forcible entry and
detainer, 42 O. S. 249 ; it laid from the district court to the com
mon pleas in election contests, 19 O. S. 189. The judgments of
the Superior Court of Cincinnati were formerly reviewable by
the district court, 75 v. 804, though not those of general term, 34
O. S. 289: but they were a short time prior to April, 1880, 5 Bull
413. Judgments or final orders of the superior court at general
term are now reviewable only by the supreme court, \\ 503, 0710.
Judgments or final orders of the superior court at special term
are reviewable by that court at general term for errors appearing
in the proceedings at special terms or by exceptions taken in
accordance with H 5297-5304 ; see \ 499a; and a judge of such
court sitting in special term may reserve and adjourn for de
cision in general term any question of law or fact arising in any
case upon the record or upon evidence in writing; and judg
ments, etc., may be entered in reserved cases in general term,
t! 503. The proceedings to obtain such review are the same as
those provided by these sections (0707-6740^ on petition in error,
except that it is not necessary to file with the petition a tran
script of the proceedings, but the petition in error is heard on
the original files, pleadings, and proceedings; and the superior
court at general term has the power to render such judgment
as should have been rendered at special term, or remand the
cause to the special term for judgment, and upon such judg
ment execution may Issue as upon original judgments, ii 499a.
§ 6710. Jurisdiction of supreme oourt in error. A judgment rendered, or final order made, by the circuit
court, any court of common pleas, probate court, or the
superior court of any city or county, may be reversed,
vacated or modified by the supreme court, on petition
in error, for errors appearing on the record ; but no pe
tition in error, in such cases, except as to the judgment
or final order of the circuit court, shall be filed, without
leave of the supreme court, or a judge thereof, and the
supreme court shall not, in any civil cause or proceed
ing, except when its jurisdiction is original, be required
to determine as to the weight of the evidence ; and on
application of any party, excepting to a ruling or de
cision of the circuit court during the trial, or on motion
for a nsvc trial, such court shall find from the evidence,
and state on the record, the facts upon which the
alleged error arises, or which may be material in de
termining whether error has intervened or not.

Error lay to the district court from the supreme court in
election contests, 15 O. S. 573; from the supreme court to the
common pleas in cases appealed from county commissioners,
43 O. S. 210; from the supreme court to the probate court
in proceedings to appropr<ate property, 5 O. S. 276; not from
common pleas in such cases, 39 O. S. 170; lies from the su
preme court to general term superior court, § 503. If relief
can be had in the district court, it must be sought there, unless
there is special reason for coming to the supreme court, 3 O. S.
509 ; 34 O. S. 163. Exception must be taken during the trial—
hearing of motion to dismiss petition in error—order of dismissal
not reviewable, 44 O. S. 525. 44 O. S. 438 construes the amend
ment, 80 v. 169, I 6707, notes.
§ 6711. The record in the supreme court must be
printed. When a petition in error is filed in the su
preme court, so much of the record to be reviewed as
will show the error complained of shall be printed, and
ten of the printed copies thereof filed with the papers,
which printing the plaintifff' in error may have done, or
he may deposit with the clerk sufficient money to pay
the costs thereof ; and if he fail for sixty days after
filing the petition, to file such printed copies or make
such deposit, the petition in error shall be dismissed,
unless the court, on good cause shown, extend the time
or dispense with such printing; and the fair expense cf
such printing shall be taxed as part of the costs. The
clerk shall deliver to the court, at each monthly call of
the docket, a list of cases in default under this section, and the court shall call the same and make disposition
thereof as herein provided. [80 v. 169 ; 75 v. 804, \ 5.]
Dismissal of petition in error for want of printed record held
a bar to a second petition in error, 36 O. S. 9;). The provision of
this section as to the time within which records must be printed
has no application to cases reserved from the district court, 38
O. S. 373 ; see rule 5, supreme court, 35 O. S. 396.
§ 6712. When supreme court shall assess penalty.
When, in any such case, the judgment or final order of
a circuit court is affirmed, there shall be taxed, as part of
the costs in the case, a reasonable fee, to be fixed by the
court, not less than twenty-five nor more than three hun
dred dollars, to the counsel of the defendant; and the
court shall adjudge to the defendant damages in such
sum as may be reasonable, not exceeding five hundred
dollars, unless the judgment or final order of the circuit
court directs the payment of money, and execution
thereof was stayed in such proceeding in error in the
supreme court, when, in lieu of such penalty, it shall
bear additional interest, at a rate not exceeding five per
centum per annum, for the time for which it was stayed,
to be ascertained and awarded by the court (1); but if the
supreme court certify in its judgment that there was
reasonable cause for the proceeding in error, neither
such fee, nor additional interest, nor penalty, shall be
taxed, adjudged, or awarded (2). [82 v. 37 ; 75 v. 804, \ 6.]
1. 2 W. L. M. 272, 418. Part pavment relieves pro tanto, 8 O.

19 O. 26.
§ 6713. Petition and summons in error. The proceed
ings to obtain such reversal, vacation, or modification
shall be by petition in error, filed in a court having
power to make the reversal, vacation, or modification,
and setting forth the errors complained of; thereupon a
summons shall issue and be served, or publication made,
as in the commencement of an action, and a service on
the attorney of record in the original case shall be suffi
cient ; the summons shall contain a statement that a pe
tition in error has been filed in the case ; and if issued
in vacation, it shall be returnable on or before the first
day of the term of the court, and if issued in term time,
it shall be returnable on a day therein named ; and if the
last publication, or service of the summons, be made ten days before the end of the term, the case shall stand for
hearing at that term ; but the supreme court, on the
hearing of a motion for leave to file a petition in error,
whereof ten days' personal notice has been given to the
adverse party, or his attorney, may, in its discretion, at
the time of granting such leave, if error, for which the
judgment or final order should be reversed, vacated, or
modified, plainly appear on the record, and all the judges
sitting at the hearing concur therein, enter a judgment
of reversal, vacation, or modification, without the issue
or service of a summons in error. [72 v. 172, \ 515.]
Parties. All parties interested must be made parties, 14 O. S.
287 ; all parties below must be made parties, 41 O. S. 179 ; must
be summoned, 3 O. 337 ; W. 138, or appear, 21 O. S. 620. Persons
who have an interest in the subject matter affected by the judg
ment or final order are proper parties, 1 O. S. 1. " Contested" in
election contest case, party to the record, is a proper party to
prosecute error, 19 O. S. 189. Executor or administrator must be
made party defendant in case of judgment against deceased
party, 15 O. 300 ; 35 O. S. 244. Proceedings in error can not be in
stituted in the name of a deceased party, 35 O. S. 660. Heirs
must be made parties in action to recover land, 21 O. S. 620. All
defendants in a.joint judgment are necessary parties to a petition
in error prosecuted by one of them, 14 O. S. 287. In a joint judg
ment, error as to one is error as to all, 14 O. 413; 21 O. S. 131. A
joint judgment debtor—partner—omitted by mistake, may be
made a party plaintifff though the statutory period in which
error may be brought has elapsed, 39 O. S. 218. The omission,
as party to a petition in error, of one of the defendants in the
lower court will not deprive the reviewing court of jurisdiction,
and if the defendant in error does not mate the objection in the
district court he can not in the supreme court, 40 O. S. 431. Judg
ment creditor of defendant can not prosecute error, W. 737.
Privies must allege ana show their interest, 35 O. S. 244. Where
the action was against three makers and the indorser of a prom
issory note, and one of the makers only made a defense, and
judgment was rendered against all, it was held that the maker
who answered, filed his petition in error, must submit to a
judgment of dismissal unless he made the co-makers or indorser
parties, 13 O. S. 568. Purchaser at sheriff's sale can not prose
cute error, W. 574. Where judgment in a civil action is taken
against several defendants, only some of whom have appeared
in the action or been served with process, and those not appear
ing or being served afterward release all error in the proceeding,
the defendants served with process can not reverse the judgment
for such error or irregularity, 21 O. S. 181. Injunction against
judgment at law does not operate as a release of errors, 3 O. 20.
Judgment setting aside sale can not be reversed* as to some of the
parties and affirmed as to others, 21 O. S. 131. The provision of
the code that if no objection be taken on account of defect of
parties the defendant will be deemed to have waived the same,
appliey to proceedings in error, 17 O. S. 69; generally, 2C. C. R. la From whatjudgments or orders error lies. It lies from order for
alimony pendente lite, 17 O. S. 563 ; 38 O. S. 370; does not lie from
order amending pteadings, 6 O. S. 199; lies from order discharging
attachment, 5 O. S. 42; see 42 O. S. 102 ; lies in bastardy proceedings,
6 O. S. 252; does not lie from judgment by consent, 16 O. S. 163;
lies from order as to custody of children in divorce cases, 38 O. S.
558; from judgment against deceased person, 15 O. 300; does not
lie as to matters resting in the discretion of the court—as setting
aside a levy, 3 O. 269; permitting separation of jury during a
trial, 15 O. 72; amendments, 17 O. 293; the examination of a wit
ness who remained in court contrary to its order, 18 O. 99 ; di
recting a special verdict, 8 O. S. 570; ine continuance of a cause,
11 O. 8. 691—unless the discretion is grossly abused, 36 O. S. 201.
Error does not lie in cases of divorce and alimony, 6 O. S. 64 ; see
fj 5706 ; it lies from supreme court Id sale of lands by executor to
pay debts, 7 O. (Pt. 2) 138; lies only from final judgment, order, or
decree, see \ 6707, notes; lies in habeas corpus proceedings, 6 O. S.
55: from refusal of mandamus, 43 O. S. 457; from proceedings by
municipal corporation in openino streets, 2 O. S. 228, formerly not,
14 O. 240; from proceedings in partition, 13 O.518 (but see 380n).
Assignment of errors. A reviewing court is not bound to notice
errors in the record which have not been specifically assigned, 8
O.S.243; 1 O. S. 386. When there is no assignment judgment
may be affirmed, 1 O. S. 386. Errors not assigned in the district
court will not be considered in the supreme court, 33 O. S. 555,
and only those errors assigned in the district court are consid
ered, on error, to reverse judgment of district court affirming
that of common pleas, 17 O. S. 262 ; 33 O. S. 555. Errors not as
signed are presumed to have been waived, 32 O. S. 514, and when
waived, or not objected to below, can not be assigned, 10 O. S.
557 ; 25 O. S. 554. The court will not look beyond the assign
ments specially made in the court below unless there was a gen
eral assignment in that court, 6 O. S. 473; 17 O. S. 262 ; 27 Id. 592;
29 Id. 327, and when there is u general assignment it is the duty
of the court to examine the whole record. 15 O.557; 2 O. S. 21.
While the court is not bound to notice errors not specifically as
signed, supra, it may consider errors not assigned at all—such as
those relating to jurisdiction, 22 O. S. 38; 30 O. S. 133; but notice
of the objection that the petition does not contain facte sufficient
to constitute a cause of action, should, in some form, appear on
the record in the reviewing court before the ease is heard. 30
O. S. 133. Answer alleging facts after judgment, 32 O. S. 76; 39
Id. 54; 3C. C. R. 209.
§ 6714. Issue and service of summons. The summons
mentioned in the last section shall, upon the written
precipe of the plaintifff in error, or his attorney, be issued
by the clerk of the court in which the petition is filed,
to the sheriff of any county in which the defendant in
error, or his attorney of record, is found ; when the writ
is issued to a foreign county, the sheriff thereof may re
turn it by mail to the clerk, and shall be entitled to the
same fees as if it had been returnable to the court of
common pleas of the county in which such officer resides ; and the defendant in error, or his attorney, may
waive, in writing, the issue or service of the summons.
[51 v. 57, §516; S. & C. 1103.]
Where the summons is only directed to one defendant, service
on the attorney of all the defendants is only good as to the de
fendant named in the summons, 21 O. S. 131. Service on the
attorney after the death of the party is invalid, 15 O. 300.
§ 6715. When summons must not issue. A summons
in error shall not be issued in a case in which there is,
upon the minutes of the court, or among the files of the
case, a waiver of error by the party endeavoring to com
mence such proceedings, or his attorney, unless the court
in which the petition is to be filed, or a judge thereof,
indorse on the same permission to issue the summons.
[51 v! 57, \ 609 ; S. &C. 1135.]
§ 6716. What must be filed with petition in error, The
plaintifff in error shall file with his petition either a tran
script of the final record, or a transcript of the docket or
journal entries, with such original papers or transcripts
thereof as are necessary to exhibit the error complained
of ; and, if original papers and pleadings are filed, and
the final record has not been made, the reviewing court
may permit the temporary withdrawal of the originals
for a reasonable time, to allow the recording thereof, or
direct copies thereof to be made and filed, and the orig
inals to be returned to the inferior tribunal. [67 v. 114,
§517.]
Court can not accept original papers as substitute for tran
script, 15 O. S. 484; see 23 O. S. 581. The transcript mentioned in
this section is a complete transcript, and not a copy of the jour
nal entries merely, 3 O. S. 490. Dismissal for failure to file, 5 Bull
14 ; see 3 Bull 325. Petition will not be dismissed when the tran
script is filed but not indorsed by the clerk, 33 O. S. 213.
§ 6717. Transcript must be furnished on tender of proper
fees. Probate judges, justices of the peace, and other
judicial tribunals having no clerk, and the clerks of every
court of record, shall, upon request, and being paid the
lawful fees therefore, furnish an authenticated transcript
of the proceedings, containing the judgment or final
order in said courts, to either of the parties to the same,
or to any person interested in procuring such transcript.
[51 v. 57, §518; S. & C. 1104.]
§ 6718. How execution of judgment may be stayed. No
proceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify a judgment or final order rendered in the probate court, common
pleas court, or circuit court, except as provided in the
fourth subdivision of this section, and in 6720 and
6721, shall operate to stay execution, unless the clerk of
the court in which the record of such judgment or final
order is made take a written undertaking, to be executed
on the part of the plaintifff in error to the adverse party,
with sufficient surety, as follows :
1. When the judgment or final order sought to be re
versed directs the payment of money, the written under
taking shall be in double the amount of the judgment
or order, to the effect that the plaintifff in error will pay
the condemnation money, and costs, if the judgment or
final order be affirmed, in whole or in part.
2. When it directs the execution of a conveyance, or
other instrument, the undertaking shall be in such sum
as may be prescribed by a court of record, or a judge
thereof, to the effect that plaintifff in error will abide the
judgment, if the same be affirmed, and pay the costs.
3. When it directs the sale, or delivery of possession,
of real property, the undertaking shall be in such sum
as may be prescribed by a court of record, or a judge
thereof, to the effect that, during the possession of such
property by the plaintifff in error, he will not commit,
nor suffer to be committed, any waste thereon, and that,
if the judgment be affirmed, he will pay the value of the
use and occupation of the property from the date of the
undertaking until thedelivery of the possession, pursuant
to the judgment, and all costs; and when the judgment
is for the sale of mortgaged premises and the payment of
a deficiency arising from the sale, the undertaking must
also provide for the payment of such deficiency.
4. When it directs the assignment or delivery of docu
ments, they may be placed in the custody of the clerk of
the court in which the judgment was rendered, to abide
the judgment of the reviewing court, or the undertaking
shall be in such sum as may be prescribed as aforesaid,
to abide the judgment, and pay costs, if the judgment be
affirmed. [82 v. 37 ; 51 v. 57, ? 519 ; S. & C. 1104.]
The bond need only substantially conform to the statute, 1 O.
170. Where one of several defendants against whom judgment
had been rendered, prosecuted error alone against the adverse
party, and judgment was affirmed, it was held an action could
be sustained upon such bond, though there was a defect of parties plaintifff in error, and a second petition in error by all the
parties was pending. 29 O. S. 620. A bond conditioned to prose
cute writ of error to effect and abide the judgment binds the
obligors to pay the amount of the judgment, and in the declara
tion upon such bond it was not necessary to aver that the writ
of supersedeas was taken out by the plaintifff in error. 5 O. 169.
Where the relief desired during the pendency of the proceeding
in error is an order to stay further action in the proceedings
which, by the original action, the plaintifff seeks to enjoin, such
relief should be sought under § 5578; 36 (). S. 316.
1. In an action 'ui such undertaking, affirmance of judgment
as to one defendant forfeits the bond as to all, 3 Bull 11 ; 1 Clev.
R. 89. The nature and extent of the obligation should bealleged
in the petition, showing the facts, amount, and foundation of
plaintifff's claim, ID. 161; see2C. C. R. 459 ; 3 Id. 484.
3. Where the judgment is for the sale of mortgaged property,
the undertaking should provide against waste, and for the value
of the use and occupation as well as for payment of deficiency.
34 O. S. 671. Under this clause the common pleas or a judge
thereof may fix the amount of the undertaking for stay in that
court while the case is pending on error in the supreme court,
38 O. S. 658 ; see 3 C. C. R. 484.
§ 6719. Undertaking must be approved. Before the
written undertaking mentioned in § 6718 shall operate
to stay execution of the judgment or order, the execu
tion of the undertaking and the sufficiency of the sure
ties must be approved by the court in which the judg
ment was rendered or order made, or by the clerk thereof ;
and the clerk shall indorse such approval, signed by
himself, upon the undertaking, and file the same in his
office for the defendant in error. [51 v. 57, \ 521 ; S. & C.
1105.]
§ 6720, Substitute for undertaking. Instead of the
undertaking prescribed in the second subdivision of
§ 6718, the conveyance or other instrument may be exe
cuted, and deposited with the clerk of the court in which
the judgment was rendered, or order made, to abide the
judgment of the reviewing court. [51 v. 57, § 520 ; S. & C.
1105.]
§ 6721, When executors, guardians, etc, need not give
undertaking. Executors, administrators, and guardians,
who have given bond in this state, with surety, accord
ing to law, shall not be required to give the undertak
ing mentioned in § 6718. [51 v. 57, § 607 ; S. & C. 1135.]
§ 6722. When execution may issue after undertaking
given. In an action on a contract for the payment of
money only, or in action for injuries to the person, if the
defendant in error give adequate security to make restitution in case the judgment be reversed or modified, he
may, on leave obtained from the court below, or a judge
thereof in vacation, proceed to enforce the judgment,
notwithstanding the execution of the undertaking to
stay proceedings; such security must be an undertaking
executed to the plaintifff in error, by at least two suffi
cient sureties, to the effect that if the judgment be re
versed or modified he will make full restitution to the
plaintifff in error of the money by him received under
the judgment; but the provisions of this section shall
not apply to judgments recovered in actions for libel,
slander, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, or
assault and battery. [71 v. 106, \ 522.]
Restitution bond can not be set off, 31 O. S. 28 ; see 2 C. C. R.
459 ; 2 H. 61 ; 2 W. L. M. 329 ; 5 Bull 423.
§ 6723. Limitation. No proceedings to reverse, va
cate, or modify a judgment or final order shall be com
menced unless within six months after the rendition of
the judgment or [the] making of the final order com
plained of ; or in case the person entitled to such pro
ceeding is an infant, a maried woman, a person of un
sound mind or imprisoned, within six months as afore
said, exclusive of the time of such disability. [86v. 167.]
Appearance in supreme court estops to deny appearance in
district court, 26 O. S. 185. Disability of one inures to all, 3 O. 49 ;
12 O. 351 ; 21 O. S. 131. Consent can not confer jurisdiction after
expiration of limitation, 43 O. S. 57. Limitation of act of 1878
(two years) not retroactive. 38 O. S. 46. Neither motion for new
trial, 34 O. S. 1, nor exception, necessary where there is a finding
, of facts, 35 O. 113. Pleading of limitation not necessary, 35 O. S.
247. but facts bringing party within saving clause must be
pleaded, 35 O. S. 2N2. Petition may be am ended so as to bring party
within saving clause, ;iG O. S. 312; petition pleading iaots must

§ 5357, limitation three years, 34 O. S. 1204; £ 4991 has no applica
tion to proceedings in error, 34 O. S. 537. Summons must issue
before proceeding deemed commenced, though petition is filed
in time, 16 O. S. 284 ; 36 O. S. 312. Time begins to run from day
judgment is actually rendered, not from first day of term, 16
O. 8. 417; if it begins to run during life of ancestor, it docs not
stop at his death, 38 O. S. 373. When an appeal is dismissed and
a motion to reinstate is continued to the next term and then
overruled, time begins to run only from the overruling of such
motion, 12 O. S. 333 ; see 45 O. S. 444 ; 3 C. C. R. 290; 1 C. C. R. 345.
§ 6724. Stay of execution of judgment of justice. No
Sroceeding to reverse, vacate, or modify a judgment renered, or final order made, by a justice of the peace, shall operate as a stay of execution, unless the clerk of
the court of common pleas take a written undertaking
to the defendant, executed on the part of the plaintifff in
error by sufficient surety, to the effect that the plaintifff
will pay all the costs which have accrued or may accrue
on such proceedings in error, together with the amount
of any judgment that may be rendered against such
plaintifff in error, either on the further trial of the cause,
after the judgment of the court below is set aside or re
versed, or upon and after the affirmance thereof in the
court of common pleas; when the judgment or final or
der of a justice, sought to be reversed, directs the deliv
ery of possession of real property, the undertaking shall
be in such sum as may be prescribed by the court of
common pleas, or a judge thereof, or, in the absence of
such judge, by the probate judge of the county, to the
effect that, during the possession of such property by
the plaintifff in error, he will not commit, nor suffer to
be committed, any waste thereon, and that if the judg
ment be affirmed he will pay the value of the use and
occupation of the property from the date of the under
taking until the delivery of the property, pursuant to
the judgment, and costs; and the person entitled to such
proceedings shall have the same time for prosecuting the
same, before he is barred, as is provided in the last sec
tion, unless the judgment be paid off or satisfied prior to
the commencement of such proceedings. [51 v. 57, § 524 ;
59 v. 43, I 524 ; S. & C. 1106 ; S. & S. 568.] See 10 O. S. 318.
§ 6725. Terms of stay of execution in other cases.
Execution of a judgment or final order, other than those
enumerated in this chapter, of any judicial tribunal, or
the levy or collection of any tax or assessment therein
litigated, may be stayed, on such terms as may be pre
scribed by the court in which the petition in error is
filed, or by a judge thereof. [75 v. 808, § 22; 51 v. 57,
§ 525; S. &C. 1106.]
This section " merely provides for the suspension for the
'stayins' of the execution of the judgment or final order. It
does not. either in terms or in spirit, vacate the judgment. That
is left to stand until reversed or set aside, and though not in the
meantime to be executed." But in eases of contested elections,
the order of the common pleas is not suspended by the allow
ance of a supersedeas under this section, 14 O. S. 515; 31 O. S.
451. An order staying the execution of a judgment or final or
der, as provided in this section, will only bo granted on good cause shown, and the mere pendency of a petition in error to
reverse the judgment of reversal is not a sufficient ground fot
an order granting such stay, 34 O. S. 291 ; see 2 C.C.R.518;3IiJ.3j2.
§ 6726. Proceedings after reversal. When a judgment
or final order is reversed, either in whole or in part, in
the common pleas court, the circuit court, or the supreme
court, the court reversing the same shall proceed to ren
der such judgment as the court below should have ren
dered, or remand the cause to the court below for such
judgment ; the circuit court or the common pleas court
so reversing a judgment shall, upon the request of either
party, specify in writing the ground or grounds of such
reversal, which shall be filed and kept with the papers
in the case ; the court reversing or affirming such judg
ment or final order, shall not issue execution in causes
that are so brought before it on error, on which it
pronounces judgment, as aforesaid, but shall send a
special mandate to the court below, as the case may
require, for execution thereon, and the court to which
such special mandate is sent shall proceed in the same
manner as if such judgment or final order had been ren
dered therein ; and on motion, and good cause shown, it
may suspend any execution made returnable before it
by order of the common pleas court, the circuit court,
or the supreme court, in the same manner as if the exe
cution had been issued from its own court; but such
suspension shall not extend further than to stay pro
ceedings until the matter can be further heard by the
common pleas court, the circuit court, or the supreme
court, as the case may be ; but this section shall not ap
ply to judgments of justices of the peace. [82 v. 38 ; 67
v. 115, \ 526.]
The judgment must bo such as the court below should have
rendered, 5 O. S. 251 ; 15 O. S. 40 ; 20 O. S. 232 ; 21 O. S. 492, 499,
1 C. C. R. 108; and may be reversed in part, 11 O. 72; 7 O. S. 107,
31 O. S. 433; and as to part of defendants, 32 O. S. 399; but
where they are united in interest, the judgment is a unit and
can uot be reversed as to some and affirmed as to others, 21 O. S.
131. Final judgment may be rendered on reversal, 15 O. S. 559,
but not for error in refusing a new trial, 25 O. S. 300 ; 26 O. S. 639,
unless the facts are undisputed, 40 O. S. 339 ; see Final Judgment,
§ 0707, notes. The reviewing court may, on reversal, grant an
injunction, 38 O. S. 32 ; and may make an order of restitution,
which will be final and conclusive between the parties, 31 O. S.
28; 35 O. S. 045. The judgment of reversal is effective notwith
standing the death of plaintifff in error, and it is competent
for the court to which the cause is remanded for a new trial to order a revivor of the action in the name of the proper repre
sentative of the deceased party, 38 O. S. 96. Where the district
court dismisses a proceeding in error on the erroneous ground
that the judgment complained of is not reviewable, the supreme
court is vested with discretion, on reversal of such erroneous
order, to remand the cause to the district court for further pro
ceedings, or render such judgment as that court should have
rendered, 38 O. S. 558. When remanded, the case is taken up
where the first error occurred, 1 O. S. 463. The duty of enforcing
the judgment is imposed on the court to which the mandate is
sent, and its disobedience punishable by contempt by that court,
41 O. S.401. Court may, on remittitur, affirm judgment as modi
fied, 37 O. S. 434. Party making remittitur and accepting judg
ment for reduced amount can not prosecute error, though re
duction was erroneous, 36 O. S. 418 ; see i O. S. 98: 15 Id. 464.
f! 6727. Costs on error. When a j udgment or final order
is reversed, the plaintifff in error shall recover his costs,
and when reversed in part, and affirmed in part, the court
may apportion the costs between the parties in such man
ner as it deems equitable. [51 v. 57, § 527 ; S. & C. 1 107.]
This only includes the costs on error, and not the costs in the
court below, 16 O. 316. Where the court has no jurisdiction, it
can render no judgment for costs, but costs of proceedings in
error to reverse a judgment rendered without jurisdiction
must be adjudged to plaintifff in error, 22 O. S. 268. Where the
case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter,
but the court erroneously proceeds to render judgment against
each party for his costs, the judgments and proceedings to re
verse the same are ex parte, and the provisions of this sec
tion which have application to proceedings of an adversary
character do not apply ; hence such judgments will only be
reversed at the costs of plaintifff in error, 8 O. S. 205. Mistake
as to costs may be corrected by reviewing court ; case not within
this section, 18 O. S. 184. Where several damages are assessed on
several causes of action, a judgment for the aggregate amount of
damages may bo reversed as to part of the causes of action and
affirmed as to the rest. In such ease, where error was assigned
to all the causes of action, and the judgment reversed as to part
and affirmed as to the residue, the costs on error were, under
this section in its original form, equally divided between the
parties, 31 O. S. 433 ; see 10 O. S. 453. Now the court apportions
the costs in its discretion. Remittitur, see preceding section.
§ 6728. Mistake of clerk not ground of error, etc.
A mistake, neglect, or omission of the clerk shall not be
a ground of error, until the same has been presented
and acted upon in the court in which the mistake, neg
lect, or omission occurred. [51 v. 57, § 528 ; S. & C. 1108.]
§ 6729. Rendering judgment prematurely not ground
of error. The rendering of judgment before the action
stood for trial according to the provisions of title one,
part third, shall be deemed a clerical error. [51 v. 57,
§ 529; S. &C. 1108.1
Entering judgment against a garnishee before judgment
against the defendant is to be regarded, after judgment against
the latter, as only a clerical error, 13 O. S. 219. But a judgment
rendered by default before the day named in the summons for
answer may be reversed, 34 O. S. 123.
§ 6730. Penalty on affirmance by circuit oourt. If the
circuit court affirm a judgment on petition in error, it
shall also render judgment against plaintifff in error for
five per centum upon the amount due from him to the
defendant in error, unless the court enter upon its min
utes that there was reasonable ground for the proceedings
in error. [82 v. 38 ; 51 v. 57, I 608 ; S. & 0. 1 135.]
See I 6712, note.
§ 6731. Writs of error and certiorari abolished. Writs
of error and certiorari to reverse, vacate, or modify judg
ments or final orders in civil cases are abolished (1); but
courts shall have the same power to compel transcripts
of the proceedings, containing the judgment or final
order sought to be reversed, to be furnished, completed,
or perfected, as they heretofore had under writs of error
and certiorari (2). [51 v. 57, § 530 ; S. & C. 1108.]
1. Except as to matters of a criminal nature, certiorari was
abolished by the code, 2 O. S. 326 ; 4 Id. 500 ; 6 Id. 55, 252; 19 Id.
348. 2. 15 O.S.295; but a reviewing court can make no altera
tion in the record of the court below, 27 O. S. 44. The parly de
siring such perfect record in the reviewing court suggests in
writing filed in the cause that the record before the court is not
a full or complete record, called "suggestion of diminution of
record ; " whereupon the court will issue an order to the lower
court to certify up a transcript of the complete record, which
must be all of such record in the lower court, which court can
not make new parts of such record not before existing, Yaple's
Pr., etc., 656. Proceedings subsequent to the reversal form no part
of the record of the final judgment of reversal, aud can not be
brought into the court of last resort upon suggestion of diminu
tion of record. The remedy is by answer, 32 O. S. 76 : see 30 O. S. 53.
(i 6732. Proceedings when judgment ofjustice affirmed.
If the judgment of a justice of the peace, taken on error
as herein provided to the court of common pleas, be af
firmed, such court shall render judgment against the
plaintifff in error for the costs of suit, and award execu
tion therefore; and the court shall thereupon order its
clerk to certify its decision to the justice, so that the judg
ment affirmed may be enforced as if such proceedings in
error had not been taken ; or, such court may award ex
ecution to carry into effect the judgment of the justice, in the same manner as if the judgment had been ren
dered in the court of common pleas. [51 v. 57, \ 531 ;
S. & C. 1108.]
§ 6733. Proceedings when judgment of justioe reversed.
When the proceedings of a justice of the peace are taken
on error to the court of common pleas, in manner afore
said, and the judgment of such justice is reversed or set
aside, the court shall render judgment of reversal, and
for the costs that have accrued up to that time, in favor
of the plaintifff in error, and award execution therefore;
and the cause, except when the reversal is because the
justice had no jurisdiction of the plaintifff in error, or of
the subject of the action, shall be retained by the court
for trial and final judgment, as in cases of appeal. [67
v. 115, § 532.]
Common pleas, on reversal, retains cause for trial, 4 O. S. 593,
except when reversal is because justice had no jurisdiction ; con
tra, 17 O. S. 641 (before amendment). When the judgment of a
ustice is reversed on error, it is the duty of the court to render
udgment for the costs of the plaintifff in error up to that time,
ncluding the costs in the justice's court, 22 O. S. 371 ; see, gener
ally, 31 O. S. 634. I 6565 provides for taking bills of exceptions
on trials before justices; § 6610 for exceptions in forcible entry
and detainer cases. In proceedings to reverse, etc., judgments
of the justice in such cases, leave must be obtained of the com
mon pleas to file the petition in error in that court, Id.
§ 6734. Decrees in ohancery, how reviewed. The final
orders or decrees of courts of chancery heretofore ren
dered, or which may hereafter be rendered, in any chan
cery proceeding pending on July 1, 1853, may be reviewed
in the manner provided in the five succeeding sections,
and within the time prescribed in § 6723 ; and all suits
in chancery pending at that time may be prosecuted to
final decree in like manner as if this title had not taken
effect. [51 v. 57, ? 533 ; S. & C. 1 109.]
§ 6735. Bill of review. When a party, complainant
or defendant, seeks a review of a final decree or order in
chancery, he may file in the clerk's office of the court in
which the decree was rendered a short petition, setting
forth the names of the parties to such suit, the substance
of the decree or order sought to be reviewed, and an as
signment of the errors relied upon to reverse or set aside
such decree or order, and a prayer for such reversal ; and
errors in law and in fact may be assigned at the same
time. [46 v. 90, f\; S. & C. 1110.]
§ 6736. Process therecn. On the filing of such peti
tion, the clerk shall issue a summons against all the par
ties to the original suit, except such as are petitioners in
the suit of review, as in other cases. [46 v. 90, \ 2 ; S. &
C. 1112.]
§ 6737. Original papers to be used. All the original
papers and evidence in the original cause, and the entries
made, shall be used on the hearing of the bill of review;
and it shall not be necessary for the party to procure a
copy of the record of proceedings in the original cause,
nor shall it be necessary to recite, in the bill of review,
any of the facts set forth in the pleadings in the original
cause. [46 v. 90, § 3 ; S. & C. 1112.]
§ 6738. How decree in circuit court may be stayed.
When a petition for review is filed in the circuit court, a
judge of the court may, in vacation, upon good cause
shown, stay proceedings on the former decree until the
next term of the court in which such proceedings are
pending; and the judge shall direct the nature and the
amount of security to be given by the party applying for
such stay. [82 v. 38 ; 49 v. 26, § 1 ; S. & C. 1112.]
§ 6739. How stayed in common pleas. When such
petition is filed in the common pleas, the judge of such
court may exercise the same power, on the same terms.
[49 v. 26§2; S. & C. 1112.]
§ 6740. Petition in error in the nature of a bill of
review. A petition in error, in the nature of a bill of re
view, may, on leave of the supreme court, or a judge
thereof, be filed in the supreme court, to reverse or mod
ify any decree in chancery, that heretofore has been or
that hereafter may be rendered in any circuit court in
this state, in which the title to real estate is in contro
versy, or the amount in controversy is not less than five
hundred dollars; and the proceedings upon such petition
in error shall, in all respects, be governed by the provis
ions of the six preceding sections of this chapter; but
this section shall not extend to suits that have been com
menced since the first day of July, 1853, and the petition
in error must be filed within three years after the rendi
tion of the decree so sought to be reversed or modified.

should be accompanied by the bill, 22 O. S. 207 ; but where the

O. S. 308.
§ 6742. By what oourts it may issue. The writ of man
damus may be issued by the supreme court (1), the cir
cuit court, or the common pleas court; and although it
may require an inferior tribunal to exercise its judgment,
or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions, it can
not control judicial discretion (2). [82 v. 38; 77 v. 265;
51 v. 57, §569; S. & C. 1124.]
1. Application should be made to the circuit court unless there
are special reasons for making it in the first instance to the su
preme court. Such cases in the latter court are not entitled as
of right to be heard out of their regular order on the general
docket, 26 O. S. 170. 2. 1 O. S. 30, 149 ; 17 O. S. 608, 610 ; 24 ii. S.
393, 401 ; 26 O. S. 364 ; 43 O. S. 652.
§ 6743. Application for the writ. The application for
the writ must be by petition, in the name of the state, on
the relation of the person applying (1), and verified by
affidavit; and the court may require a notice of the ap
plication to be given to the defendant, or may grant an

Sec i 671171.; 1 O. S. 77; 22 O. S. 634; 42 O. S. 30; 3 C. C. R. 332.
§ 6745. When peremptory writ may issue in the first
instance. When the right to require the performance of
the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse
can be given for not performing it, a court may, in the
first instance, allow a peremptory mandamus; and in all
other cases an alternative writ must first be issued, on
the allowance of the court, or a judge thereof. [51 v. 57,
§572; S.&C.1127.]
42 O. S. 263, 275. The refusal to allow an alternative writ is not
reviewable on error ; the remedy is by application to a higher
court, 37 O. S. 121.

the writ, and an order that the defendant, immediately
upon service, do the act required to be performed, or,

place, why he does not do the act, shall be entered on the
journal. [51 v. 57, § 574 ; S. & C. 1127.]
§ 6747. By whom writ to issne. What to contain.
Service. The writ shall be issued by the clerk of the
court in which the application is made, and shall con
tain a copy of the petition, verification, and order of al
lowance, and shall be served upon the defendant, per
sonally, by copy, by the sheriff of the proper county, or
by a person specially authorized by the court or judge ;
such officer or person shall report his proceedings there
with to the court; and if the service be made by a per
son not an officer, the return must be verified by his affi
davit. [51 v. 57, § 571 ; S. & C. 1126.]
Counsel must prepare the writ and submit it to the court. It
is not the duty of the clerk to prepare it, 4 O. S. 493. The alter
native writ must contain a statement ot all the facts necessary to
justify the order sought for by the proceedings, 22 O. S. 371. It
may be amended, 4 O. S. 493 ; 23 O. S. 335 ; may, on motion, be re
quired to be made more definite and certain, Id.; see 1 C. C. R.
119 ; but omissions can not be supplied by affidavits, 22 O. S. 371.
§ 6748. When defendant may demur or answer. On
the return day of an alternative writ, or such further
day as the court may allow, the defendant may answer as
in a civil action ; or, if the writ be allowed by a single
judge, he may demur. [51 v. 57, I 575 ; S. & C. 1127.]
The answer must respond to all the allegations in the writ, or
it will be held bad on demurrer, It O. '252. An an3wer in man
damus to compel a judge to sign a bill of exceptions, that de
fendant is willing to sign a true bill, and that the bill presented
is not true, is sufficient, 220. S. 207; see Form, 43 O. S. 16; 19 O. IKS
§ 6749. Reply and demurrer. The plaintifff may de
mur to the answer, or reply to any new matter therein ;
and the defendant may demur to the reply as in a civil

Formerly no reply was allowed, 9 O. S. 599.
§ 6750. Judgment on default. If no answer be made,
a peremptory mandamus must be allowed against the
defendant. [51 v. 57, 1 576 ; S. & C. 1127.]
§ 6751. Pleadings construed as in civil action. The
pleadings shall have the same effect, and must be con
strued, and may be amended, as in civil actions. [51 v.
57, § 577; S. & C. 1127.]
43 O. S. 16.
§ 6752. Issues of fact ; how tried, Issues of fact
made by the pleadings must be tried, and the further
proceedings thereon had, in the same manner as in civil
actions. [51 v. 57, § 577 ; S. & C. 1127.]
§ 6753. What damages may be recovered. If judg
ment be given for the plaintifff, the relator may recover
the damages which he has sustained, to be ascertained
by the court, or a jury, or by a referee or master, as in
a civil action, and costs ; and a peremptory mandamus
shall also be granted
[51 v. 57,
§ 578; S. & C. 1128.]
Where judgment is given for plaintifff, this section does not
authorize the assessment of damages against the state in favor
of the relator, 36 O. S. 409.
§ 6754. Such recovery shall be a bar. Such recovery
of damages against a defendant shall be a bar to any
other action upon such cause of action. [51 v. 57, § 579;
S. & C. 1128.]
§ 6755. Costs against relator. If judgment be given for the defendant, all costs shall be adjudged against the
relator. [75 v. 813, \ 15.]
See 4 Bull 60S, 614.
§ 6756. Penalties. When a peremptory mandamus
has been directed to a public officer, body, or board, com
manding the performance of a public duty specially en
joined by law, and the court finds that such officer, or
any member of such body or board, has, without just
excuse, refused or neglected to perform the duty bo en
joined, the court may impose a fine, not exceeding five
hundred dollars, upon such officer or member ; and such
fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of
the county wherein the duty ought to have been per
formed, and the payment thereof shall be a bar to an
action for any penalty incurred by such officer or mem
ber by reason of such refusal or neglect. [51 v. 57, § 580 ;
S. & C. 1128.]
§ 6757. When county auditor to levy and assess tax.
When a peremptory mandamus has been awarded
against the commissioners of a county, or the trustees or
board of education of a township, or the council, trustees,
or board of education of a municipal corporation, to
levy and assess a tax to pay interest upon a debt, or to
create a sinking fund for the payment of a funded debt,
and such officers have resigned, or refuse or neglect to
levy and assess such tax, or their offices are vacant, the
court, upon the motion of an interested person, and
upon being satisfied of the fact of such resignation, va
cancy, or refusal or neglect to levy such tax, and of the
right of such person to have the same levied and assessed,
may cause a special order to be issued to the auditor of
the proper county, commanding him to levy and assess
upon the taxable property of the county, township, or
municipal corporation the taxes required by law, or the
judgment or order of said court, to be levied and assessed
for the purposes aforesaid, and to place the same upon
the duplicate for collection by the county treasurer. [63
v. 15, 1 1 ; S. & S. 604.]
§ 6758. Auditor responsible as an officer of court. His
fees. When such special order is issued to the auditor
he shall be responsible for the execution thereof in the,
same manner as if he were an officer of the court; and
he shall receive such fees for his services in executing the order, if not otherwise fixed by the court, as he is
allowed by law for making tax duplicates ; which fees,
and all other costs of the proceeding, he shall add to the
taxes levied in executing such order, and place the same
upon the duplicate for collection with such taxes. [63
v. 15, §2; S.&S. 606.]
§ 6759. The last two sections not to limit power of
court. The provisions of the last two sections shall not
be construed to limit the power of the court to carry its
order and judgment into execution, or to punish any
officer named therein for contempt or disobedience of its
orders or writs. [63 v. 15, \ 3 ; S. & S. 607.]
§ 6760. When quo warranto may be brought. A civil
action may be brought in the name of the state :
1. Against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or un
lawfully holds or exercises, a public office, civil or mili
tary, or a franchise, within this state, or an office in a
corporation created by the authority of this state.
2. Against a public officer, civil or military, who does
or suffers an act which, by the provisions of law, works
a forfeiture of his office.
3. Against an association of persons who act as a cor
poration within this state without being legally incor
porated. [75 v. 814, 815 ; 36 v. 68, ? 1 ; S. & C. 1264.]
Quo warranto is now a civil action, and proceeds bv petition
and not by information, 8 Rec. 422 ; 34 O. S. 365. The presidency
of a city council is a public office, within the meaning of this
section, 45 O. S. 196. The action lay to oust police commissionsrs
appointed by the governor under 82 v. 101, and removed by him
for misconduct, 44 O. S. 98: but not to oust the superintendent
of police appointed under that act and suspended by the mayor
for insubordination. Id. 137. It was held the proper remedy to
test the legality of the election of trustees of a cemetery associa
tion, 5 O. S. 238. It was brought to test the constitutionality of
the act, 82 v. 236, relating to parol of prisoners, 13 O. S. 629. It
does not lie to try title to an office the term of which has expired,
17 O. 143, or nearly expired, 17 O. S. 543, or where the statute has
provided a mode of contest, 15 O. S. 114. Quo warranto for usur
pation must be against the individuals, not against the corpora
tion, 18 O. S. 263; 8 Rec. 422. For forms of pleading see 18 O. S.
263. Acknowledgment of certificate of incorporation before no
tary, Instead of justice of peace, under S. & C. 272, held bad on
quo warranto, 21 O. S. 662.
§ 6761. When against a corporation. A like action
may be brought against a corporation :
1 . When it has offended against a provision of an act
for its creation or renewal, or any act altering or amend
ing such acts.
2. When it has forfeited its privileges and franchises
by non-user.
3. When it has committed or omitted an act which
amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights, privi
leges, and franchises.
4. When it has misused a franchise, or privilege, or
right conferred upon it by law, or when it claims or holds
by contract or otherwise, or has exercised a franchise,
privilege, or right in contravention of law. [78 v. 43;
75 v. 815; 36 v. 68, I 8; S. & C. 1266.]
The action must be against the corporation itself, 25 O. S. 280.
A clear case must be made to authorize a forfeiture, 32 O. S. 487.
A corporation is entitled to the benefit of the amendment of a
statute pending suit, 26 O. S. 19. The evidence is limited to the
charges made in the petition, 23 O. S. 445. The rights and lia
bilities of third persons can not be determined, 43 O. 8. 482.
§ 6762. Who may commence action. The attorney
general, or a prosecuting attorney, when directed by the
governor, supreme court, or general assembly, shall com
mence any such action ; and when, upon complaint, or
otherwise, he has good reason to believe that any case
specified in the preceding section can be established by
proof, he shall commence an action. [75 v. 815; 36 v.
68, H 1, 8 ; 50 v. 267, $ 9, 10, 11, 12 ; S. & C. 89, 1264, 1266.]
The attorney general alone can commence the action in the
supreme court. The authority of the prosecuting attorney is
confined to the county, 34 O. S. 365. Judgment in favor of de
fendant in quo warranto by prosecuting attorney on individual
relation is no bar to an action on the relation of the attorney
general, 18 O. S. 262.
§ 6763. Upon whose relation, Such officer may, upon
his own relation, bring any such action, or he may, on
leave of the court, or a judge thereof in vacation, bring
the action upon the relation of another person; and if
the action be brought under the first subdivision of
§ 6760, he may require security for costs, to lie given as
in other cases. [75 v. 815; 36 v. 68, § 1 ; S. & C. 1264.]
The attorney general may, on his own relation, without being
directed by the governor, supreme court, or general assembly,
bring a civil action in quo warranto against a person who usurps.
intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises, a public office,
45 O. S. 196. He may in such case require security for costs, but
need not do so, Id.
§ 6764. Id. In case of usurpation of office. A per
son claiming to be entitled to a public office unlawfully
held and exercised by another may, by himself or an
attorney at law, upon giving security for costs, bring an
action therefore. [75 v. 815; 37 v. 70, } 1 ; S. & C. 1270.]
The relator, under this section, is not required to obtain leave
to file the petition, but the action must be brought in the county
in which the defendant resides or may be summoned, 34 Q S. 365.
§ 6765. Who to prosecute in absence, etc., of prosecut
ing attorney. When the office of prosecuting attorney
is vacant, or when the prosecuting attorney is absent,
interested in the action, or disabled from any cause, the
court, or a judge thereof in vacation, may direct or per
mit any member of the bar to act in his place to bring
and prosecute the action. [36 v. 68, § 23 ; S. & C. 1269.]
§ 6766. Petition in action for usurpation of office.
When the action is against a person for usurping an of
fice, the petition shall set forth the name of the person
who claims to be entitled thereto, with an averment of
his right thereto ; and judgment may be rendered upon
the right of the defendant, and also upon the right of
the person so averred to be entitled, or only upon the
right of the defendant, as justice requires. [75 v. 815 ;
36 v. 68, §3; S.&C. 1265.]
But a petition prosecuted on behalf of the state by the at
torney general to oust an incumbent of an office need not set
forth the name of the persou claiming to be entitled thereto, 38
O. S. 101.
§ 6767. Parties defendant. All persons who claim to
be entitled to the same office or franchise may be made
defendants in the same action, to try their respective
rights to such office or franchise. [75 v. 815; 36 v. 68,
§7; S.&C. 1266.]
§ 6768. Where action to be brought. An action under
this chapter can be brought only in the supreme court,
or in the circuit court of the county in which the de
fendant, or one of the defendants, resides or is found, or,
when the defendant is a corporation, in the county in
which it is situated, or has a place of business ; but when
the attorney general files the petition, the action may be brought in the circuit court of Franklin county. [82 v.
39 ; 75 v. 816 ; 36 v. 68, ? 1 ; 50 v. 267, 1 13 ; S. & C. 89, 1264.]
See § 204 (82 v. 18). Formerly the action could be brought in
the common pleas, S. & C. 89, and a judge of the common pleas
had authority as a member of the district court to grant leave to
file the information in the district court, 5 O. S. 216. § 204 (S. &
C. 89) did not repeal or supersede the authority of the prosecut
ing attorney to hie the information, 5 O. S. 216 ; and it was held
that the district court had jurisdiction in quo warranto against
an association of individuals for usurping a corporate franchise
when either the office of the association or the office of its presi
dent was within the county, Id. \ 204 provides that the at torney^eneral may prosecute any proceeding in quo warranto in
the supreme court of the state, the circuit court of Franklin
county, or the circuit court of any county wherein the company
proceeded against has a place of business, or the officer or offi
cers, person or persons, made defendants reside or may be found,
82 v. 18.
§ 6769. Application for leave to file petition, and notice
to defendant. Upon application for leave to file a peti
tion, the court or judge may direct notice thereof to be
given to the defendant previous to granting such leave,
and may hear the defendant in opposition thereto ; and
if leave be granted, an entry thereof shall.be made on
the journal, or the fact shall be indorsed by the judge on
the petition, which shall then be filed. [75 v. 816 ; 36 v.
68, ? 9; S.&C.1267.]
§ 6770. Issue of summons, and service. When the pe
tition is filed without leave and notice, a summons shall
issue, and be served as in other cases; and such sum
mons may be sent to and returned by the sheriff of any
county by mail, who shall be entitled to the same fees
thereon as if it had been issued and returned in his own
county. [75 v. 816 ; 36 v. 68, § 2 ; S. & C. 1265.]
§ 6771. Service by publication. When a summons is
returned not served because the defendant, or its officers
or office, can not be found within the county, the clerk
shall publish, for four consecutive weeks, in a newspaper
published and of general circulation in the county, and
if there is no such newspaper, then in a newspaper
printed in this state, and of general circulation in such
county, a notice, setting forth the filing and substance of
the petition ; and, upon proof of such publication, the
default of the defendant may be entered, and judgment
rendered thereon, as if the defendant had been served
with summons. [75 v. 816 ; 36 v. 68, ? 13 ; S. & C. 1268.]
§ 6772. Pleadings after petition. The defendant may
demur, or file an answer, which may contain as many
several defenses as he has, within thirty days after the
filing of the petition, if it was filed on leave and notice, or
after the return day of thesummons ; and the plaintifff may
file a demurrer or a reply to such answer within thirty
days thereafter. [75 v. 816 ; 36 v. 68, § 1 2 ; S. & C. 1268.]
Defendant may set up several defenses, 22 O. S. 354, 361. An
answer that defendants have for twenty years exercised the fran
chise which they are accused of usurping is sufficient, It O. 126;
quaere, whether it applies when attorney general prosecutes, 18
O. S. 262. In quo warranto for usurpation of office, the answer
must allege continuance of qualification for office, 15 O. 723.
Resignation after defendants nave been served with process is
no answer, 22 O. S. 354, nor injunction in United States courts
before action, 18 O. S. 263. Where, in quo warranto for usurping
the franchise of being a corporation, the defendants named
plead that they were the directors of the corporation without de
nying that they were corporators, and averred the legal exist
ence of the corporation, it was held they were regarded as claim
ing to be members of the corporation, 22 O. S. 411. Where the
time for answer stated in the summons was the third Saturday
after the return day, it was held the summons should be quashed,
11 Bull 294. Cause of forfeiture of franchise may be set up by rep
lication, 10 O. 535, 542 ; 23 O. S. 121-126. Reply demurrable for

chise to be a corporation or from the exercise of the powers ille
gally assumed, 35 O. S. 258. And where a corporation has as

©f incorporation does not comply with the requirements of the

its discretion, will oust it of the franchise to be a corporation, 29
O. S. 399; but where a corporation has been guilty ofsuch neglif;ence as is made, by the terms of its charter, a cause for the toreiture of its franchise, and the state on the relation of thenttorney general demands a judgment of dissolution on account
thereof, the court has no discretion to refuse such judgment on
the ground that public or private interest would be better sub
served by preserving the existence of the corporation, 23 O. S.

itor against stockholders to enforce payment of subscriptions, 38
O. S. 269.
