grounds of defense, counterclaim, and set-off as he has, whether the)· 
are such as have been heretofore denominated legal or equitable, or

the petition against the plaintifff, or against other defendants in the same 
action; and each must be separately stated and numbered, and they
must refer in an intelligible manner to the causes of action which they 
are intended to answer. [51 v. 57§84, 93·} 
SEC. 6072. The counterclaim mentioned m the preceding section
must be one existing in favor of a defendant, and against a plaintifff,
between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and

SEC. 5076. If a new party be necessary to a final decision upon
the set off, the court shall permit the new party to be made, if, owing

defendant will be in danger of losing his claim unless permitted to 
use it as a set-off. (51 v. 57, § 98.]
SEc. 5077. When cross-demands have existed between persons, 
under such circumstances that if one had brought an action against the
other a counterclaim or set-off could have been set up, neither can he

death, but the two demands must be deemed compensated, so far as 
they equal each other. [51 v. 57, ~ 99.] 
SEC. 5078. The guardian of an infant, or of a person of unsound
mind, or an attorney for a person in prison, shall deny in the answer

and concise language, any new matter, not inconsistent with the peti­
tion, constituting an answer to such new matter in the answer. [51 v. 
s:. ] 
57, '=" IOI.· 
SUBDIVISION VI. GENERAL RULES. 
SF.c. 5080. When in an answer affirmative relief is demanded
against a co-defendant, such co-defendant may demur or answer there­
to, as if it were a petition ; and to such answer of the co-defendant a
demurrer or reply may be filed as in other cases. 
SEC. 5081. Every material allegation of the petition not contro­
verted by the answer, and every material allegation of new matter in
the answer not controverted by the reply, shall, for the purposes of the
action, be taken as true; but the allegation of new matter in the reply
shall be deemed controverted by the adverse party, as upon a direct
denial or avoidance, as the case may require; and allegations of value,
or of amount of damage, shall not be considered as true, by failure to 
controvert them. [51 v. 57, ~ 127.) 
SEC. 5082. A material allegation in a pleading is one essential to
the claim or defense, which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient. [51 v. 57, § 128.]

pleading. r 5 I v. 57, ~ I '7,]

account, or upon an instrument for the unconditional payment of money

or instrument, with all credits and the indorsements thereon, and to
state that there is due to him, on such account or instrument, from the
adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims, with interest; and
when others than the makers of a promissory note, or the acceptors of
a bill of exchange, are parties, it shall lie necessary to slate the f;wts 
which fix their liability, [51 v. Si·~ r z z.]

SEc. 5089. The court, at any time before the final submission of
the cause, may, on motion of the defendant, allow a counterclaim or
set-off to be withdrawn, and the same may become the subject of another
action; on motion of either party, to be made at the time such counter­
claim or set-off is withdrawn, an action on the same shall be docketed

and manner of pleading therein; and if an action be not so docketed,
suit may be brought as in other cases. [51 v. 57, ~ 119.]

SEc. 5091. In pleading the performance of conditions precedent
in a contract, it shall be sufficient to state that the party duly performed

performance. (51 v. 57, 121.]

him; and in such action it shall not be necessary to set out any obscene

SUBDIVISION I. SVl\ll\lONING AND IMPANELING THE JURY. 
SEC. 5162. The court of common pleas of each county shall, at
the first term thereof in each year, determine the number of persons 
necessary to be selected in each county, annually, to serve as grand
and petit jurors in the district court, superior court, and court of com­
mon pleas, and in counties in which the probate court has criminal
jurisdiction, for such probate court required in such jurisdiction, and
cause a memorandum thereof to be entered on the journal; such
order, if not made at that term, may be made at any other time, and
amended from time to time at the discretion of the court, and, until it
is made, the number of persons to be selected for jurors in each county
shall be as theretofore determined; but if there has been no such
determination, the number shall be one hundred and thirty, until other­ 
wise ordered. (70 v. 167, § 1.] 
SEc. 5163. The clerk of the court of common pleas of each
county shall, on the first Monday of September, annually, apportion 
the number of jurors determined as aforesaid among the several town­
ships, and the wards of municipal corporations, in his county, accord­
ing to the number of male inhabitants therein of twenty-one years of
age, and shall make, in writing, a statement of the number of jurors so
apportioned to each township and ward, and. forthwith deliver the
same to the sheriff, who, at the time of giving public notice of the gen­
eral fall election, shall insert a clause in his notification giving the
trustees of the several townships, and the councilmen of the several
wards, notice of the number of persons to be returned for jurors there­ 
from, respectively. (70 v, 167, S 2.] 
SEC. 5164. The trustees of each township, and the councilmen of
each ward, shall, on the day of such general election, annually, select,
of good, judicious persons, having the qualifications of an elector, and
not exempt by law from serving as jurors, the number of persons desig­
nated in the notice to be returned for jurors therefrom, and shall make
a list thereof, and deliver the same to the judge of election who returns
to the clerk of the court the poll-book of the election; and such judge of
election shall deliver the list to the clerk at the time he returns the poll­ 
book. r10 v. 167, § 3·] 
SEC. 5165. If the trustees of any township, or the councilmen of
any ward, fail to return the names of jurors as herein required, to the 
clerk of the court, the clerk shall, on ascertaining the fact, immediately
notify the trustees or councilmen of the failure, and they shall there­
upon meet, and select and return to the clerk, without delay, the requi­
site number of names as aforesaid; and the names so returned shall be 
placed in the box as if returned with the poll-books. [70 v. 167, § 19.] 
SEC. 5166. If all of the names of jurors be drawn from the box, or
the names of a sufficient number of jurors for the transaction of the 
business of the court for the unexpired portion of the year be not left
in the box, the judge of the court of common pleas of the county may,
during term time, or in vacation, order such number of jurors as he
may consider necessary to be apportioned among the several townships
and wards in the county, as provided by section Ji/tJ'-(Jne hundred 
and sixty-three: the clerk, after making such apportionment, shall
cause a statement in writing of the number of jurors required of each
township and ward to be forthwith delivered to the sheriff of the county,
who shall forthwith serve the same upon the trustees and councilmen,
and return it, as a summons is served and returned; and the trustees of
the several townships, and the councilmen of the several wards, shall,
immediately on the receipt of the statement, proceed to select good, judi­
cious persons, having the qualifications of an elector, who were not
selected at the previous fall election, to the number required of their
respective townships and wards, and transmit a list of the names of per­
sons so selected to the clerk of the court. [70 v. 167, s 4.] 
SEC. 5167. The clerk of the court shall, within five days from the
· f h Ii ' h f · h l d 
receipt o t e ists, write t e name o eac person so se ecte upon a separate piece of paper, which he shall put into a box, to be provided by 
him at the expense of. the county, and securely kept for the purpose,
and shall, at the clerk's office, between the hours of ten o'clock forenoon, and twelve o'clock noon, on the fourth Monday previous to the
sitting of the court of common pleas, in the presence of the sheriff, by
whom the box shall he shaken before the drawing is made, so as to mix
the ballots on which the names are written, and in presence of any
other citizens who may choose to attend, proceed to draw twenty-seven
ballots, the persons named on the first fifteen of which shall be summoned as grand jurors, and those named on the remainder shall be summoned as petit jurors; and the clerk shall forthwith issue a venire to the
sheriff, commanding him to summon the persons whose names are so
drawn to attend as jurors, at the seat of justice of the county, on the
first day of the next term of the court of common pleas holden therein,
at ten o'clock A. M., unless the judge of the court of common pleas, by
order made in vacation or term time, direct on what day of the term the
petit jurors shall appear, whereupon the clerk shall issue a venire
accordingly. [70 v. 167, § 5.] 
SEC. 5168. Unless the clerk is satisfied that a jury will not be
required, he shall, between the same hours, at the saf!le. place, and ~n 
the same presence, on the fourth Monday before the sitting of the district court in his county, in like manner draw the names of twelve persons to serve as jurors at that term; upon the receipt of an order of
the judge of the court of common pleas, he shall forthwith, in like manner, at the same place, and in the same presence, draw the names of
twelve persons to serve as petit jurors, or twenty-seven persons to serve
as grand or petit jurors, for a special term of said court; upon the
order of the district court, or court of common pleas, at any special
term, he shall forthwith, in like manner, draw the names of the number of persons named in the order, to serve as jurors at such term;
and in every such case he shall issue his venire for the appearance of
the jurors at the proper time and place. (70 v. 167, § 6; 50 v. 96, 
§ 3-7.] 
SEC. 5169. If the venire be issued in vacation, the sheriff shall
summon the persons named therein at least ten days before the sitting
of court, and if it be issued in term he shall summon them forthwith ;

corporation, or a non-resident of this state; or, 
2. Has absconded, with the intent to defraud his creditors; or,
3. Has left the county of his residence, to avoid the service of a 
summons; or,

7. Has property, or rights in action, which he conceals; or,
8. Has assigned, removed, disposed of, or is about to dispose 
of, his property, or a part thereof, with the intent to defraud his cred­
itors; or, 
9. Has fraudulently or criminally contracted the debt, or incurred

vacated either by a judge in vacation, or by the court, previous to the
trial of the action, and an appeal is taken, after such trial, from the
judgment or final order of said court to the district court, an injunc­
tion may be granted, at any time before judgment or final order in the
action in the district court, by a judge of the supreme court, or the
district court in which such action is pending, or a judge of any court
of common pleas in the district where the action is pending, upon its
appearing satisfactorily to the court or judge, by affidavit of the party,
or his agent, that the party is entitled thereto; and, upon the like proof,

he may sustain if it be finally decided that the injunction ought not to 
have been granted. [51 v. 57, ~ 242.]

enjoined, shall state the injunction, and shall be issued by the clerk;
when the injunction is allowed at the commencement of the action, the
clerk shall indorse upon the summons "injunction allowed," and it
shall not be necessary to issue the order of injunction; nor shall it be
necessary to issue the same when notice of the application therefore has
been given to the party enjoined; and the service of the summons so 
indorsed, or the notice of the application for an injunction, shall be
notice of its allowance. [51 v. 57, ~ 243.]

mitted to close custody until he complies with such requirement, or is 
otherwise legally discharged. [72 v. 50, § 247.] 
SEC. 5582. A party enjoined may, at any time before judgment,

upon reasonab e notice to the party w o o tame the injunction, move
the court for additional security ; and if it appear that the surety in the

modification shall give to the adverse party such notice of the time and
place at which the motion will be heard as the court or judge may 
deem reasonable; and the application may be made upon the petition

DOWER. 
SEC. 5711. When the plaintifff dies before the assignment of her
dower, or before entry of the final judgment, the action may be revived
in the name of her executor or administrator; the court shall proceed
to hear and determine, if not before decided, whether the plaintifff
would have been entitled to dower in such action if she had lived ; if
it be found that she would have been so entitled, the court shall adjudge
in favor of such executor or administrator a sum equal to one-third of
the rental value of the real estate in which it is found the plaintifff
would have been entitled to dower, from the time of filing the petition
until her death, after deducting one-third of the necessary expenses;
and the sum so adjudged in favor of such executor or administrator
shall be a lien upon the real estate in which such plaintifff would have
been entitled to dower, and its payment may be enforced by sale as
upon execution. [60 v. 10.] 
SEc. 5712. When dower is adjudged, the court shall appoint three
judicious, disinterested men of the county in which the action is pend­
ing, who are not of kin to either of the parties interested, to Le com­
missioners, and issue its order to the sheriff of that county, command­
ing him that, by the oaths of the commissioners, which may be admin­
istered by him, he cause to be set off and assigned such dower to the 
plaintifff, in the manner set forth in the judgment. [54 v, 2 7, 3 12; 
38 v. 37.] 
SEC. 5713. The commissioners and sheriff shall in all things obey
the order, and return their proceedings thereon to the court at such
time as the court appoints; if the court approve the assignment, it
shall he entered on the records thereof, and shall be · thenceforth valid
and effective in law; and execution shall thereupon be issued, directing
the sheriff of the county to put the widow in full possession of the 
dower assigned to her. [54 v. 27, ~ 12.] 
SEC. 5714. When an estate of which a woman is dowable is entire,
and no division thereof can be made by metes and bounds, dower
shall be assigned as of a third part of the rents, issues, and profits
thereof, to be computed and ascertained by the commissioners. [ 29 v. 
249, § 14.]
SF.c. 5715. The commissioners shall, after they have set off and 
assigned <lower, make a just and true appraisement of the yearly value,
after deducting necessary expenses. of the real estate in which the widow
is entitled to dower, estimating such value from the day of filing the peti­
tion to the day of assignment of dower, and make return of such
appraisernent and assignment, and the court shall adjudge the payment
of one-third of the whole sum so returned, to the widow, out of the
real estate not covered by her dower, upon which judgment execution
may issue; but nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to
require execution to be issued against such of the defendants in dower
as are minors; but in all such cases the dower shall operate as a lien
upon the real estate, for their proportion of the judgment, until the 
same is folly paid. [ . .p v. 6, ~ 1.] 
SF.c. 5716. The commissioners, in making the appraisernent of the
yearly value of the real estate provided for in the last section, shall 
exclude all permanent or valuable improvements made thereon after the
husband of such widow ceased to be the owner thereof. ]41 v. 6, § 2.] 
SEc. 5717. If, during the minority of an heir, dower be assigned to
a widow not en.titled thereto, or. if she recov.er the same by t.he default, 
fraud, or collusion of the guardian, such heir may, on com mg of age,
have an action against such widow to recover the lands wrongfully 
awarded. r 29 v. 249, § 13.] 
SEc. 5718. If resistance be made to the petition of a widow claiming dower, and the court find that she is entitled to dower as claimed
in the petition, the defendant so resisting shall be required to pay all
costs of suit; but if no resistance be made, the widow shall pay
one-third of the costs, and the legal owner of the real estate shall pay 
two-thirds thereof. [41 v. 6, §22; 73 v. 127, §38.J ·

estate by executors, administrators, and guardians, the widow of any 
decedent who has a dower interest therein, being a party, may file her
answer, and waive the assignment of dower by metes and bounds, and
ask the court to have the estate sold free of dower, and to allow her in
lieu thereof such sum of money, out of the proceeds of the sale, as the
court deems the just and reasonable value of her dower interest therein. 
l 7 4 V. 201, ~ I.] 
SEc. 5720. The answer of the widow shall have the same force
and effect, and shall be taken and held to be, in all respects, as a deed 
of release to the purchaser of such estate of the dower interest therein
of such widow. (74 v. 201, § a.] 
SEc. 5721. The guardian ot a widow who has been adjudged
insane may appear and answer for her in such action, subject to the
approval of the court in which the action is pending; and the answer
of the guardian. shall have the same force and effect as if the widow
answered personally; but the guardian shall be liable to the widow, or
her heirs, for all damage or loss sustained by his fraud or collusion, notwithstanding the approval of the court. [74 v. 201, § 3.] 
SEC. 5722. A person owning real estate in this state, incumbered
by the contingent or vested right of dower of an insane woman, may 
apply, by petition, to the court of comon pleas of the county in which
the real estate, or any part thereof, is situate, making defendants thereto
such insane woman, and also her husband and guardian, if she has
either or both, for leave to sell all or any part thereof, discharged and
unincumbered of such contingent or vested right, which petition shall
set forth the insanity of the woman, together with a description of the
land proposed to be sold; the court shall thereupon appoint a committee
of six competent men, of whom at least three are physicians, who shall,
under oath, inquire into the fact of the insanity of such woman, and
shall hear testimony to be produced by her husband or guardian, or,
if there is no such guardian, by her guardian ad litem, to he appointed
by the court in the action; and the committee shall, at any term of such
court, make a report in writing of the result of their investigation, 
signed by all the members thereof (35 v. 105, ~ 1; 60 v. 24, S I.] 
SEC. 5723. If the committee report unanimously that such woman
is, in their opinion, permanently insane, the court shall appoint three
judicious freeholders to appraise the real estate mentioned in the petition,
whether the same is in one or several counties, who shall report in writ- 
ing the value of each tract. [35 v. 105, § 2; 60 v. 24, § 2.] 
SEc. 5724. Upon the filing of such report the court may direct
such petitioner to convey, by good and sufficient deed of conveyance, 
to the insane woman, to be by her held in fee, such proportion of the 
real estate set forth in the petition as shall to the court seem just and
proper, or the court may assign to such insane woman. to lie by -her
held during life, after the death of her husband, if she has a husband,
such proportion of the real estate set forth in the petition as shall to the
court seem just and proper, for her support, or the court may order the
petitioner to invest an amount, to be hy it fixed, in the stock of a corn­ 
pany, or stocks created by the laws of this state. as by the court may
be designated, the profits and dividends arising from such investment
to be applied to the support and maintenance of the insane woman after
the death of her husband, if she has a husband; and the petitioner
may. upon his compliance with the order of the court, sell all the real
property he is possessed of, described in his petition, free and unim­
cumbered of the contingent or vested right of dower of such. insane 
woman. [35 v, 105, § 3: 60 v . 24, § 3.] 
5725. When the husband of an insane woman conveys any
real estate in this state owned by him, in which such insane woman has
a contingent or vested right of dower, by virtue of such ownership of
her husband, or otherwise, and she does not join her husband in such
conveyance, he may apply by petition to the court of common pleas
of the county in which she resides, or, if she resides out of the state,
then in which the real estate is situate, for leave to have any part or all
of such real estate so conveyed released and disincumbered of her
dower right therein, which petition shall set forth the insanity of the
wife, and a description of the land proposed to be affected: to which
petition the insane wife, her guardian, if she has one, and all persons
in interest, shall be made defendants, and the petition shall be proceeded in, in all respects, in the manner prescribed in the three preced­
ing sections, except that instead of ordering the petitioner to sell the
real estate, or to convey or assign to such insane woman any part
thereof, the court shall direct the petitioner to make such investment
as in said sections provided, or may require the petitioner to secure the
amount to the use of the insane woman by the mortgage to her of unin­
cumbered real estate of at least double the value thereof; and upon
compliance by the petitioner with the order of the court, the court shall
enter a judgment releasing and discharging the real estate from the
encumbrance of such contingent or vested right of dower, and shall
adjudge the holder of the legal title, or other party liable, to pay to the
petitioner any sum withheld or retained as indemnity against such
dower right. [ 61 v. 99, § 1.]

in the estate. 
In the latter case, and in cases where an undivided interest is subject
to a life estate, and the tenant for life has not, by answer, elected to
receive the value of his estate out of the proceeds of a sale of the
interest, the commissioners may, if an appraisement of the estate is to
be returned, assign the dower, or set off the life estate, or, if they find
it for the interest of the parties so to do, they may appraise the whole

therein party to the action ; and upon the hearing he shall be entitled
to recoup, against the plaintifff's demand, the present worth of any
existing lien or encumbrance thereon; and if the adverse estate or

assent, to surrender the possession to his vendor, upon the repayment
of so much of the purchase money as has been paid thereon, with
interest, or direct the payment of the purchase money claimed in the
action, upon the plaintifff giving bond in double the amount thereof,
with two or more sureties, to be approved by the court, for the payment of the same, with interest, if the defendant or his privies be subsequently evicted by reason of the defect. ( 67 v. 116, § 557.]

-ant unlawfully keeps him out of the possession; and it shall not be
necessary to state how the plaintifff's estate or ownership is derived.

the service of a summons, and deduct the amount thereof from the
estimated value of such lasting and valuable improvements; and the
jury shall also assess the value of the land .at the time judgment was

adjustment; and the decision of such persons, or any two of them,
shall be binding on all the parties, unless the commissioner, or the person
having the lawful charge of the vessel or cargo, or a person having an
interest therein, appeal, within fifteen days, to the court of common
pleas of the county wherein the vessel or cargo was saved, or the ser­
vices were rendered, which court shall, in case of appeal, at the next

SEC. 6204. Any surety of an executor or administrator, or the
executor or administrator of any such surety, may, at any time, make 
application to the proper probate court to be released from the bond
of such executor or administrator, by filing his written request therefor with the judge of said court, and giving at least five days' notice,
in writing, to such executor or administrator; and if such court upon
the hearing is of opinion there is good reason therefore, the court shall
release such surety, and the death of a surety shall always be deemed
good cause; and if such executor or administrator fail to give new
bond, as by such court directed, he shall be removed, and his · letters
superseded; but such original surety shall not be released until such
executor or administrator so gives bond, and such original sureties shall
be liable only for the acts of such executor or administrator from the
time of the execution of the original bond to the filing of the second
bond; and the costs of such proceeding shall be paid by the surety
applying to be released, unless it shall appear to the court that the
administrator or executor is insolvent, incompetent, or is wasting the
assets of the estate. (58 v. 46, § 1.] 
SEC. 6206. Whenever the sureties in any bond of an executor or
administrator shall be insufficient, the court on the petition of any per- 
son interested, and after notice to the principal in the bond, may require
a new bond to be given, with two or more sufficient sureties. [38 v. 
146, § 196.l 
SEc. 6206. When a new bond shall be required as above provided,
the sureties in the prior bond shall, nevertheless, be liable for all breaches
of the condition, committed before the new bond shall be approved by 
the court. f 38 v. 146, ~ 198.] 
SEC. 6207. If, in the cases specified in the two preceding sec­
tions, the principal shall not give such new bond, within such time as
shall be ordered by the court, he shall be removed from his trust, and
some other person may be appointed in his stead, as the circumstances 
of the case may require. (38 v. 146, § 199.) 
SEC. 6208. If any executor or administrator shall waste, or unfaithfully administer the estate, the court granting the letters may, if it thinks 
fit, on· the application of any surety in the administration bond, order
such executor or administrator to render an account, and to execute to 
such surety a bond of indemnity, with surety or sureties approved by
the court; and upon neglect or refusal to execute such bond of indem­
nity within the time ordered by the court, it may remove him, and re­
voke his letters testamentary, or letters of administration, and appoint
another administrator in his place. [38 v. 146, !:j 200. l 
SEC. 6209. If an executor or administrator shal! unreasonably
delay' to raise money, by collecting the debts and effects of the deceased, 
or by selling the real estate, if necessary, and if he can obtain an order
therefore, or shall neglect to pay what he has in his hands; and if, in
consequence of such delay or neglect, the estate of the deceased shall
be taken in execution by any of his creditors, it shall be deemed un­
faithful administration in such executor or administrator, and he shall
be liable on his administration bond for all damages occasioned thereby. 
l38 v. 146, ~ 181.) 
SEC. 6210. After a creditor is entitled by law to the payment of
his debt, from the executors or administrators, and the amount of the 
claim has either been admitted to be just or allowed by them, or has
been ascertained by judgment or award against them, or by an order
of distribution, the bond given by them for the discharge of their trust,
may be put in suit by such creditor, if the executors or administrators
shall neglect, upon demand made by such creditor, to pay such claim. 
[38 v. 146, ~ 182.] . 
SEC. 6211. Such suit may also be brought by a legatee, after he
shall be entitled to the payment of his legacy, and by the widow, or 
other distributee, to recover his or her share of the personal estate,
after an order of the court, ascertaining the amount due to him or her, 
if the executor or administrator shall neglect to pay the same when
demanded. [38 v. 146, ~ 183.]

sentation of any person interested in the estate of any deceased testa­

form his duty, in any other particular than those above specified in the
two preceding sections, the court may authorize any creditor, next of kin,
legatee, or other person aggrieved by such maladministration, to bring 
a suit on the bond. r 38 V. 146, § I 84.] 
SEc. 6213. In an'. actions on any bond of an administrator or
executor, for a breach thereof, by not filing his final account at the time
required by law, or by order of the court, the defendant may aver and
give in evidence any facts tending to show that the said breach did not
occur by reason of neglect or unreasonable delay of the administrator
or executor to settle the estate or file said account; and if the defend­
ant shall make good his defense, he shall recover of the plaintifff his
costs; and in no case brought for such breach shall the plaintifff recover 
more costs than damages. [44 v. 76, § 1.] 
SEC. 6214. In all cases when the powers of an executor or admin­
istrator cease by death, removal, resignation, or in any other manner,
or shall have heretofore so ceased, any succeeding administrator, or
co-executor, or co-administrator, may maintain an action on the bond
of such executor or administrator whose powers have ceased, against
any of the obligors thereof, or their legal representatives, for any breach
of the conditions of the bond. [52 v. 24, § 1.] 
SEc. 6215. An action on the bond may be brought in the court of
common. pleas or superior court of the county in which it was given,
for the particular relief only to which the plaintifff is entitled, or it may 
be framed, either in the· petition or in any cross-petition filed in the
case, with a view to a settlement of all matters for which the principal
in the bond is accountable, and any heirs, devisees, legatees, widow, or
next of kin. or others, who may be liable on account of assets having
come into. their hands, or who may otherwise be proper or necessary
parties, may be made defendants; and when the action is framed for
that purpose and· the necessary parties are before the court, the court
may adjust and settle the estate in whole or in 'part, Tendering all judg­
ments required, arid may award costs as may be deemed proper. [38 v.

SEC. 6216. When suit is brought upon the administration bond, by
a creditor whose claim has been allowed or admitted bv the executor or
administrator, such allowance or admission shall be· prima facie evi­
dence only of the validity and justice of such claim; and the executor
oradministrator or other defendants may, in the suit upon the admin­
istration bond, contest the same, and the court may determine, by the
verdict of a jury, if either party require it, the amount· or justice of the
claim; and if neither party require a jury, the court shall, by reference
to a master or otherwise, decide upon the daim. [38 v. 146, § 195.]

deceased, shall be liable by action in the common pleas or superior
court, in the manner provided in the following sections, for all debts,
which could not have been sued for, against the executor or adminis­
trator, and for which provision shall not have been made as hcrcinbe­ 
fore provided. [38 v. 146, § 2 3 2.] 
SEC. 6218. Any such creditor whose right of action shall firs: cccrue
after the expiration of the time of such limitation, and whose claim
shall not have been presented to the court, or if presented shall r ot 
have been allowed, as hereinbefore provided, may recover the same
against the heirs, widow as next of kin, and next of kin of the deceased,
and the devisees and legatees under his will, each one of whom shall
be liable to the creditor to an amount not exceeding the value, whether
of real or personal estate, that he or she shall have received under the
will, or by the distribution of the estate of the deceased : provided,
that if by the will of the deceased any part of his estate. or any one or
more of the devisees or legatees, shall be made exclusively liable for
the debt, in exoneration of the residue of the estate, or of the other
devisees or legatees, the provisions of the will shaJl be complied with
in that respect. and the persons and estate so exempt by the will, shall
be liable for only so much of the debt, if any, as can not be recovered
from those first chargeable therewith; and, provided further, no such
suit shall be maintained unless it be commenced within one year next
after the time when the right of action shall first accrue, except the
person entitled to bring any action mentioned in this section be, at the
time the cause of action accrued, within the age of twenty-one years if
a male, and eighteen years if a female, a married woman, insane, or
imprisoned, every such person shall be entitled to bring such action 
within one year after such disabi!ity i~ removed. (64 v._57, § 23~.]

have been liable if living. (38 v. 146, § 234.] 
SEC. 6220. If in the case specified in the two preceding sections,
there should be more than one person liable for the debt the creditor 
shall recover the same by one action against all the persons so liable,
or as many of them as are within the reach of process; and the court 
shall thereupon determine, by the verdict of a jury if either party require it, what sum, if any, is due to the plaintifff; and they shall also
decide, according to the equities of the case, how much each of the
defendants is liable to pay toward the satisfaction of the debt. and ren- 
der judgment accordingly. [38 v. 146, § 235.] 
SEC. 6221. If any one of the heirs, devisecs, or others who were
original~y liable for the debt, shall be insolvent, or unable to pay his 
proportion thereof, or shall be beyond the reach of process, the others
shall, nevertheless, be liable to the creditor for the whole amount of
his debt: provided, that no one shaU be compelled to pay more than
the amount received by him from the estate of the deceased. (38 v. 
146, § 236.] 
SEC. 6222. No suit shall be dismissed or debarred for the want
of including, as defendants, all the persons who might have been
included; but in any stage of the cause the court may award proper 
process to bring in any other parties, and may allow such amendments
as may be necessary to charge them, as defendants, upon such terms as 
the court shall think reasonable. (38 v. 146, ~ 237.] 
SEC. 6223. If, in consequence of insolvency, absence, or from
any other cause any one of the persons liafile for such debt shall fail 
' ' . 
' 
to pay his just proportion thereof to the creditor, he shall be liable to
indemnify all who shall, by reason of such failure on his part, have
paid more than their just proportion of the debt=-such indemnity to
be recovered by all of them jointly, or in separate actions by any one
or more of them, for his or their parts respectively, at their election.

claims that shall have been laid before them, with the sum that they
shall have allowed on each claim; and the commissioners, before enter­
ing on the duties of their office, shall be sworn to the faithful discharge 
thereof. [38 v. 146, § 201. J . . . 
SEc. 6225. The comrmssroners of msolvency shall appomt convenient times and places for their meetings, to receive and examine 
the claims of creditors; and shall give notice thereof, by causing notifications to be posted up in some public places in the township in

aforesaid having regard to situation of the creditors of the estate. 
may order. [38 v, 146, ~ 202. J 
SEC. 6226. The period of six months, after the appointment of
the commissioners, shall be allowed to the creditors to present and prove 
their claims; and the court may allow such further time for this purpose,
not to exceed eighteen months from the date of the commission, as
they may think necessary, according to the circumstances of the case;
and, at the expiration of the time for the proof of debts, the commis- 
sioners shall make their written report to the court. [38 v. 146, ~ 203.] 
SEC. 6227. If, at the return of the list of claims against the estate,
made out by the commissioners as herein before provided, or made out 
by the executor or administrator, as hereinafter provided, any person
shall be liable as a surety, for the deceased, or shall have any other con­
tingent claim against his estate, which could not be proved as a debt
under the commission, upon the presentation and proof thereof before
the court, the court shall, in ordering a dividend, leave in the hands of
the executor or administrator, a sum sufficient to pay to such contin­
gent creditor, a proportion equal to what shall then be paid to the other 
creditors. r 38 v. 146, § 204.] 
6228. If, at any time within four years after the date of the
administration bond, such contingent debt shall become absolute, it may 
be allowed by the court, if not disputed by the executor or administra­
tor; and, if disputed, may be proved before the commissioners already
appointed, or others to be appointed by the court, in like manner as
if presented before the first return of the list of claims against the
estate. L,8 v. 146, § 205.] 
SEC. 6229. Upon the allowance of such claim, the creditor shall
be entitle.I to a dividend thereon, equal to what shall have been paid 
to other creditors so far as the same can be paid without disturbing
the former dividend ; and if his claim shall not be finally established, 
or if the dividend due to him shall not exhaust the assets in the hands
of the. executor· or administrator, the residue of the assets shall be
divided among all the creditors who shall have proved their debts. 
(38 v 146, § 206.]
SEc. 6230. Any person whose claim shall be disallowed, in whole 
or in part, by the commissioners, and any executor or administrator
who shall be dissatisfied with the allowance of any claim, may appeal 
from the decision of the commissioners to the probate court· if the

creditor appeals he shall, within ten days after. the decision, file with
the commissioners a bond to the executor or administrator, with surety 
to be approved by the commissioners, in the sum of one hundred dollars, conditioned to pay all costs that may be adjudged against him on 
such appeal; the executor or administrator may appeal by giving notice 
to the commissioners within ten days; and in case of an appeal, the
court shall, as soon as practicable, hear and determine the question as
to the allowance or disallowance of the claim, and shall adjudge the
costs against the party failing on such hearing. (38 v. 146, § 207, 
208.] 
SEC. 6231. Any person whose claim shall be disallowed by the
commissioners, and who shall, by accident, mistake, or otherwise, and
not by his own neglect, omit to claim or prosecute his appeal, as before 
id d hi · · d · h f h
provi e , may, upon as pennon, an notice t ereo to t e executor or 
administrator, be allowed by the court to claim and prosecute his
appeal in manner aforesaid, upon such terms as the court shall impose,
if it shall appear by affidavit that justice requires a further examination of his claim: provided, no such petition shall be sustained, unless
it be presented within two years after the return of the commissioners,
and within four years after the date of the administration bond, and
before final distribution. [38 v. 146, § 209.] 
SEC. 6232. The allowance of such appeal, and the judgment that
may follow thereon, shall. not disturb any distribution that may have
been ordered before notice of the petition, or notice of the intention
to present the same, shall have been given to the executor or adminis- 
trator; but the debts, if any, proved and allowed in the case last mentioned shall be paid only out of such assets as may remain in or come 
to the hands of the executor or administrator after payment of the sums
due on such prior order of distribution. [38 v. 146, § 210.] 
SEc. 6233. The commissioners may, when they think it proper,
require an oath to be administered to any claimant; and they may
thereupon examine him upon all matters relating to his claim; and if 
he shall refuse to take such oath, or to answer fully to all questions that
shall be lawfully put to him, the commissioners may disallow his claim,
and on any appeal from the award of the commissioners, the court shall
have the like power to examine the claimant on oath, and to disallow
his claim, if he shall refuse to take the oath, or to answer fully upon
his examination thereon. (38 v. 146, § 211.]

by the commissioners, the court shall make such an order for the distribution of the effects among the creditors as the case shall require; 
and if, before making such order, the court shall have notice of an
appeal from the commissioners, then made or pending, they may suspend the order until the determination of such appeal, or they may
order a distribution among the creditors whose debts are allowed, leav- 
ing in the hands of the executor or administrator a sum sufficient to
pay the claimant whose demand is disputed, a proportion equal to what
shall be paid to the other creditors. [38 v. 146, ~ 213.) 
SEc. 6236. If the court shall not think fit to appoint commissioners, as herein before provided, when satisfied that the estate will 
probably be insolvent, the executor or administrator shall proceed, in
the place of such commissioners, to receive and allow, if valid, the 
claims of creditors against the estate, and return to the court a list of
all the claims that shall have been laid before him, with the sum allowed
by him on each claim. [38 v. 146. ~ 2 14.)

shall prove to be SU cient to pay all the debts allowed under the commission, or under the report of the executor or administrator, as the 
case may be, the executor or administrator shall pay the same in full;
and if, after such order is made, any other debts shall afterward be recovered against him, he shall be liable therefore only to the extent of
the assets then remaining in his hands. [38 v. 1 46, § 2 26. l

after the granting of letters testamentary, or of administration, whether
any estate that has been represented insolvent, is, or is not so in fact,
any creditor whose claim shall not have been presented before the
commissioners, or to the executor or administrator who may be acting
in the place of commissioners, may commence an action therefore,
against the executor or administrator; and such action may be con­
tinued for the defendant, until it shall appear whether the estate is in­
solvent; and if it should not prove to be so, the plaintifff may prosecute
his action as if no such representation had been made. [38 v. 146,

creditors, or within such further time as the court may allow to collect
the debts and assets, so as to delay an order of distribution, he may be
compelled to render such account, in the manner herein before directed,
to compel the return of an inventory; and the same proceedings may
be had to attach him, and to discharge him, and the like revocation of
the letters granted to him may be made in case of the party abscond­
ing or concealing himself, so that no order can be personally served,
or of his neglecting to render an account within thirty days after being
committed; and new letters shall be granted with the like effect, and
like remedies on the administration bond, as in those cases. [38 v. 
146, § 230.1

SEC. 6255. A_ guardian may _be appointed to take charge o!11Y 
of the estate of a mmor; and at the time of, or subsequent to, the appomt- 
ment of such guardian to any minor having neither father nor mother, 
or whose father and mother are both unsuitable persons to have the
custody and tuition of such minor, or whose interests will, for any other 
cause, in the opinion of the court, be promoted thereby, the court may 
also appoint a guardian to have the custody and provide for the main- 
tenance and education of such minor: provided, however, that if the 
powers of the person appointed guardian be not limited by the order
of appointment, the person so appointed shall be guardian both of the 
person and estate of the ward; and the court shall in every instance
appoint a guardian both of the person and estate of the ward, unless
the interests of the minor will, in the opinion of the court, be promoted
by the appointment of separate guardians, as hereinafter [herein before]
prescribed. [ss v. 54, ~ 2.] 
SEC. 6256. No person who may have been, or shall be, an admin­
istrator on an estate, or executor of a last will and testament, shall be
appointed a guardian of the person and estate, or of the estate only of
any minor who shall be interested in the estate administered upon, or
who shall be entitled to any interest under or by virtue of such last
will and testament; but an executor or administrator may be appointed
a guardian of the person only of any minor. (55 v. 54, § 3.) 
SEc. 6257. Any male infant over the age of fourteen years, or a
female infant over the age of twelve years, shall have the right to select
a ~uardian, who, if a suitable person, shall be appointed; but if such
mmor shall fail to select a suitable person, an appointment may be
made without reference to the wishes of such minor: A minor shall
not, in any instance, have the right to select one person to be the
guardian of his or her estate only and another person to be guardian
of his or her person only, unless the court having the power of appoint­
ment shall be of opinion that the interests of such minor will be pro­
moted by the choice and appointment of such separate guardians. 
instead of one guardian, both of the person and estate. [55 v. 54, § 4.] 
6258. When a guardian has been appointed for any minor
before he or she shall have attained the age for making a selection, as 
fixed in the last preceding section, the powers of such guardian shall
continue until the ward shall arrive at the age of majority, unless such
guardian be sooner removed for good cause, or such ward shall select
another suitable guardian : After such selection is made and approved
by the court, and the person so selected is duly appointed and qualified,
the powers of the guardian previously appointed shall cease, and thereupon the final account of such guardian shall be filed and settled in 
the proper court. (55 v. 54, ~ 5.] 
SEC. 6259. Before any person shall be appointed guardian of the
person and estate, or of the estate only, of any minor, he shall file in
the office of the court having such appointment to make, a statement
of the whole estate of said minor, and the probable value thereof, and
also the probable annual rents of such minor's real estate, and shall
verify the same by affidavit, and shall give bond, with freehold sureties,
resident of the state, one of whom shall be resident of the county
where such guardian is appointed, payable to the state, in double the
amount of the personal estate belonging to said minor, and also of the
gross amount of rents that will be probably received by the guardian
from the real estate of said minor during his or her minority : pro­
vided, that in lieu of freehold surety, such person may execute to said 
minor a mortgage upon good and unincumbered real estate, first furnishing to said probate court an abstract of his title thereto, which shall
by affidavits duly filed be shown to be in value, exclusive of all improvements thereon, sufficient to secure said bond to the satisfaction of said
probate court, which mortgage shall be duly recorded in the county in
which such real estate is situate, and filed with such probate court;
which bnnd shall be conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties
of said person, as such guardian, and shall be approved by the court 
making such appointment; and such person shall also take an oath
that he will faithfully and honestly discharge the duties devolving upon
him as such guardian. [SS v. 54, § 6.] 
SEC. 6260. Before a person is appointed guardian to have the custody, maintenance, and tuition of a minor, without the right to take 
charge of the estate of such minor, he shall give bond in double the
probable expenses of maintaining and educating such minor during one
year: in all other respects his bond shall be the same as if he had
charge of the estate of his ward, and he shall take the same oath as is 
prescribed in the preceding section. f55 v. 54, § 7.] 
SEC. 6261. Exceptions may be fi ed in the proper court, by any
person on behalf of any minor for whom a guardian has been or may 
be appointed, to the bond of such guardian, as to the sufficiency of the
amount of the penalty thereof, or the sureties therein; whereupon
notice shall be given to such guardian to appear before said court within
a reasonable time, not exceeding ten days, and show cause against the
allowance of the exceptions; and upon the hearing of such exceptions,
the court may dismiss the same, or require such guardian to find additional sureties or security in a larger amount, or make such other order
as the case may require; and it shall be the duty of the court by which
any guardian is appointed, to require, of its own motion, such guardian
to give additional bond whenever, in the opinion of said court, the
interests of the ward of such guardian shall demand the same. [55 v. 
54, § 8.] 
SEc. 6262. No bond executed by a guardian shall be void, or held
invalid on account of any informality in the same, nor on account of 
any informality or illegality in the appointment of such guardian; but
such bond shall have the same force and effect as if such appointment
had been legally made and such bond executed in proper form. (55 
v. 54, § 9.J 
SEc. 6263. When the same person shall be appointed guardian of
several minors, being children of the same parentage and inheriting 
from the same estate, separate bonds shall not be required; and in such
cases only one application shall be required, and the letters of guardianship to be issued to such guardian by the court shall be in one copy,
and not one for each minor; and the court approving and recording
such bond, and issuing such letters, shall charge such fees as are
allowed by law for such services, to be charged but once, and not once
for each ward of such guardian. [ 63 v. 43, § 10.] 
SEc. 6264. Every person appointed guardian both of the person
and estate of a minor, shall have the custody and tuition of his ward, 
and the management of such ward's estate during minority, unless

sooner determine from any of the causes specified in this chapter: pro·
vided, that the father of such minor, or if there be no father, the
mother, if suitable person, respectively, shall have the custody of the
person and the control of the education of such minor. [SS v. 54,
§ 11.] 
SEc. 6265. The marriage of a ward, if a female, shall determine
the guardianship as to the person, but not as to the estate of such ward. 
[ss v. 
54.~ 
12.J 
SEC. 6266. Any father, or in case the father be dead or have gone
to parts unknown, any mother may, by last will in writing, appoint a
guardian or guardians, for any of his or her children, whether born at

ity of the child, or for a less rime. fso v. 29;, s 72.] 
SEC. 6267. \\'hen a guardian ias been appointed by will, by a
father or mother of any child, such guardian shall he entitled to prefer·
ence in appointment over all others, without reference to his place of

regulating guardians not appointed by will, except as otherwise specially 
provided. [55 v. 54, ~ 13. l 
SEc. 6268. Every such testamentary guardian shaJI give bond. in
like manner and with like conditions, as is required of a guardian
appointed by the probate court: provided, that when the testator,
in the will appointing the guardian, shall have ordered or requested that
such bond should not be given, the bond shall not be required, unless,
from a change in the situation or circumstances of the guardian, or for
other sufficient cause, the court of probate shall think proper to require 
it. [so v. 297, § 73·] .

of said ward or of several wards jointly, under the same appointment
of guardianship, shall not exceed two hundred dollars in value, said 
guardian shall only be required to render such account upon the termi­
nation of said guardianship, or upon the order of said court, made upon

shall be served on the guardian appointed in this state, specifying the
object of the application and the time when the same will be heard:
provided, no such removal shall be made in favor of any foreign guardian, unless at the time of the hearing the state or territory in which he 
was appointed has made a similar provision as to wards removing from
such state or territory; and provided, further, that the court may, in any
case, deny the application unless satisfied that the removal of the guardian appointed in this state would be to the interest of the ward. [65 v.

the court may cause all suitable orders to be made discharging the resi- 
dent guardian, and authorizing the paying over and delivery to the foreign guardian all monies and other property in the hands of the resi- 
dent guardian after his settlement. [65 v. 7, ~ 2.]

such trustee shall have satisfactory proof, as hereinafter provided, of
the authority of such guardian, or administrator, or other legal repre­
sentative, to receive the monies or estates of such minor, idiot, lunatic,
or imbecile, and that the security given by such guardian, or adminis­

of such minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, or his or her estate, and shall
moreover deem it best for the minor, idiot, lunatic, or imbecile, or his
or her estate. (72 v. 161, § 6.)

and he shall also produce an exemplification from under the seal of the
office (if there be a seal) of the proper court of the state of his resi­

TRUSTEES GENERALLY, AND THEIR ACCOUNTING. 
SEc. 6328. Any trustee of any non-resident idiot, imbecile, or
lunatic, appointed as aforesaid, and any trustee heretofore or hereafter
created by any last will or deed, or appointed by any competent
authority, to execute any trust created by any such last will or deed,
shall, as often as once each two years, render an account of the execu­
tion of his said trust, to the probate court of the county in which he
was appointed, or in which such last will or deed may be recorded, in
the manner provided by law for the settlement of the accounts of execu- 
tors and administrators: provided, this section shall not apply in any
case in which the will or deed creating such trust designates any other
tribunal for the settlement of the trust, or in which any other tribunal
shall have acquired jurisdiction. [70 v. 100, § 1.] 
SEC. 6329. The probate court shall issue and have served in the
same manner as is or may be provided by law, in the case of the set- 
tlement of executors and administrators, the necessary citations and
notices by publication or otherwise, requiring all persons interested, to
attend such settlement and make objections thereto, if any they have. 
[70 v. 100, ~ 2.] 
SEc. 6330. The said court shall have full power to hear and determine all matters relative to the manner in which the trustee has exe- 
cuted his said trust, and as to the correctness of his accounts rendered
as aforesaid; and to require any trustee, created as aforesaid within such
county, on the determination of his said trust, or on the removal or resignation of such trustee, or in case of the death of the trustee, to require
his executor or administrator to render a final account of the manner
in which he has executed his said trust, and to hear and determine all
matters relating thereto, in the same manner as the accounts of executors
and administrators are required by law to be settled. (70 v. 100, § 3.] 
SEC. 6331. The determination of the probate court on any such
settlement, whether final or intermediate, may be appealed from in the 
id d 1 f id
manner provt e for an appea rom sar court on the settlement of the 
accounts of executors and administrators, and the like proceedings shall
be had on such appeal, and the result of such proceedings on appeal certified back to the probate court. [70 v. 100, § 4.] 
SEC. 6332. The determination of the probate court on any such
settlement, shall have the same force and effect as the like determination 
as to the account of an administrator or executor: and when an account
is settled in the absence of any person adversely. interested, and with- 
out actual notice to him, the account may be opened on his filing exceptions to the account, at any time within eight months thereafter; and
upon any settlement of an account by a trustee, all his former accounts
may be so far opened as to correct any mistake or error therein, excepting that any matter of dispute between two parties, which had been
previously heard and determined by the court, shall not be again brought
in question by either of the same parties without leave of the court. 
[70 v. 100, ~ 5·]

IN~LVENT DEBTORS. 
VOLUNTARY ASSIGNMENTS. 
SEc. 6335. When any person, partnership, association, or corpora­
tion, shall make an assignment to a trustee of any property, money,
rights, or credits, in trust for the benefit of creditors, it shall be the duty
of said assignee. within ten days after the delivery of the assignment
to him, and before disposing of any property so assigned, to appear
before the probate judge of the county in which the assignor resided
at the time of executing the said assignment, produce the original assign­
ment, or a copy thereof, cause the same to be filed in the probate court,
and enter into a bond, payable to the state, in such sum .and with such
sureties as shall be approved by the court, conditioned for the faithful
performance, by said assignee, of his duties according to law; and the
court may require the assignee, or any trustee subsequently appointed,
to execute an additional undertaking whenever the interests of the cred­
itors of the assignor demand the same; any such assignment shall take
effect only from the time of its delivery to the probate judge, and the 
exact time of such delivery shall be indorsed thereon by the probate
judge, who shall immediately note the filing on the journal of the
court; and it may be delivered by the assignor to the probate judge
either before or after its delivery to the assignee. l57 v. 39, § 1; 56 v. 
231, ~ 18.l 
SEc. 63"36. If any such assignment or a copy thereof shall, for ten
days after the execution of the assignment, not be filed in the probate 
court as aforesaid, or if the assignee named thereon fail for that time to
give bond as aforesaid, the court shall, on the application of the assignor, 
or of any of his creditors, make an order removing such assignee and
appoint a trustee in his place: provided, that if more than one assignee
be named in the assignment, and some of them fail as aforesaid, the
court may permit the assignee or assignees complying with the preceding section to qualify and enter upon the discharge of the duties of 
the trust. r11 V. 74, § 2; 74 V. I ro, 8 4.J 
SEc. 63:37. Any assignee who has qualified, and any trustee
appointed by the court who has qualified, may, with the consent of the
court, resign his trust; and in case of the death, removal, or resigna- 
tion of a sole assignee or trustee, the court shall appoint one or more
trustees in his place; but if there be one or more assignees or trustees
who have not died, resigned, or been removed, the court may either
fill the vacancy caused by the death, resignation, or removal, or allow
the remaining assignee or assignees, trustee or trustees, to execute the 
trust, as the court may deem best for the trust; and the court may at
any time, on application of a majority of the creditors in amount, 
appoint an additional trustee. [71 v. 101, ~§ 1, 3, 4.]

shown by the schedule of debts on file in the court, or otherwise estab- 
lished to the satisfaction of the court, praying for permission to elect a
trustee or trustees, the court shall, by its order, fix a time for such election, 
and cause notices to be sent by mail or otherwise to each of the creditors
of the assignor, specifying the time when the creditors shall meet at
the court-room for the election of a trustee or trustees; and at the time
named, in such order, if creditors representing fifty per cent. or more
of the debts of the assignor are present in person or by attorney, they
may proceed to the election of a trustee or trustees, a majority in value
of all the debts so represented at such meeting being necessary to a
choice; and the proceedings of the meeting showing what creditors
were present as aforesaid, and the amount of the debts held by them
respectively, and who cast their several votes, shall be made out and
signed by the president and secretary of the meeting and filed with
the court ; and if the court approve the choice, and the trustee or
trustees so elected appear within ten days thereafter and give bond, the
court shall appoint him or them as such trustee or trustees, and remove
the preceding assignee or trustee: provided, that the summary determination of the court as to who are creditors and the amount of their
claims in this section provided, shall have no effect as to the validity
of such claims, except for the purpose of such election. (71 v. 73, 
§ 14.J
SEc. 6339. The court may remove any assignee or trustee, speci- 
f ying in the order the cause of removal; and on application made by
any surety or sureties of any assignee or trustee, the court may, if sat­
isfied of the reasonableness of the application, require such assignee
or trustee to give a new bond, or on failure so to do, the court shall
remove such assignee or trustee; and upon a new bond being given in
accordance with such order and approved by the court, the sureties in
the original bond shall be by the order of the court discharged from
further liability. f 71 v. 73, ~ 14.] 
SEc. 6340. Whenever the probate court appoints a trustee whether
in place of an assignee, or of a trustee before appointed by the court,
such trustee shall, within ten days after his appointment, give bond as
aforesaid, or, failing so to do, he may he considered as declining the
appointment, and the place may be filled by the court; and when a
trustee shall have given bond, he shall succeed to all the rights, powers,
and privileges of the preceding assignee or trustee; and the court may
make and enforce all orders necessary to put the newly appointed
trustee into possession of all property, monies, books, papers, evi­
dences of title, and other effects covered by the assignment, or in any
way belonging to the trust; and such trustee may, by suit in the court
of common pleas, or otherwise, compel the delivery to him of all such 
r
roperty, monies, books, papers, evidences of title, and other effects.

SEc. 6341. On the resignation or removal of an assignee, or trustee
appointed by the court, such assignee or trustee shall forthwith file and
settle his account, and on the death of any such assignee or trustee,
his legal representative shall forthwith file and settle such account; and
immediately after such settlement, such assignee, or trustee, or his legal
representative, shall pay over to his successor all monies found due
from him to the trust; and on failure so to do, or on failure to file and
settle such account, or deliver over to his successor all property,
monies, books, evidences of title, papers, and other effects in ~my way
belonging to the trust, such successor may, by action in the <·011111100 
pleas or otherwise, proceed on his bond against such assignee, or
trustee, or his legal representative and the sureties in such bond. [; 1 v.

SEC. 6342. Whenever the court appoints a trustee to act in place
of the assignee of the debtor, the assignee and the debtor shall forth­
with convey to such trustee the title to all the real estate embraced in
the assignment. [68 v. 41, ~ 2.] 
SEC. 6343. All assignments in trust to a trustee or trustees, made
in contemplation of insolvency, with the intent to prefer one or more 
creditors, shall inure to the equal benefit of all creditors, in proportion
to the amount of their respective claims, and the trusts arising under
the same shall be administered in conformity with the provisions of this 
chapter. (56v. 231, § 16.l 
SEC. 6344. All transfers, conveyances, or assignments made by a
debtor or procured by him to be made with intent to hinder, delay, or 
defraud creditors, shall be declared void at the suit of any creditor; and
the probate judge of the proper county, ffter any such transfer, con­
veyance, or assignment shall have been declared, by a court of com­
petent jurisdiction, to have been made, with the intent aforesaid, or in
trust with the intent mentioned in the next preceding section, shall on
the application of any creditor, appoint a trustee according to the pro­
visions of this chapter, who, upon being duly qualified, shall proceed by
due course of law, to recover possession of all property so transferred, con­
veyed, or assigned, and to administer the same as in other cases of
assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors: provided, however,
that any creditor instituting a suit for the purpose aforesaid, shall cause
notice of the pendency and object thereof to be published for at least
four consecutive wee ks in some newspaper printed or of general cir­
culation in the county in which said suit shall be pending; and all
creditors who shall, within fifteen days next after the expiration of said
notice, file an answer in said action in the nature of a cross-petition,
praying to be made parties thereto, and setting forth the nature and
amount of their respective claims, and shall secure the payment of their
pro rata share of the costs and expenses of such action, including rea­
sonable counsel fees, in proportion to the amount of their said claims,
either by a deposit of money, or by an undertaking given to the plain­
tiff in such sum, and with such security as the. court or clerk thereof
shall require and approve, shall he first entitled, with the plaintifff, to
the benefits of such transfer, conveyance, or assignment, in proportion
to the amounts of their respective claims; and in case of such notice
being given, the court in which such transfer, conveyance, or assign­
ment shall have been declared to have been made with the intent afore­
said, may proceed fully to administer the trust, both as to the creditors
who are parties as aforesaid, and those who have not come in and been
so made parties, distributing to the latter the surplus, if any. after satis­
fying the claims of those who have preference as aforesaid; but if such
court shall not so administer the trust, or if such notice shall not have
been given, the said court shall forthwith, on declaring the intent afore­
said, cause a copy of the judgment to be certified to the proper probate 
court, which shall, on its own motion, appoint a trustee as in this chapter
provided; and after the costs and expenses aforesaid, and the claims
of the aforesaid preferred creditors shall have been paid by such trustee,
the residue in his hands, if any, shall inure to the equal benefit of the
.·emaining creditors, in proportion to the amount of their claims. [60 v. 
3, ~ 17· l 
SEC. 6345. In all cases of assignments heretofore made, where no
final settlement and distribution has been made, the pr?ba!e judge of 
the proper county shall have the power, on the application of any
creditor of the assignor, to issue a citation against such assignee,
requiring him to appear before such probate judge, on the day named
in such citation, to show cause why he should not give bail for the
execution of his trust according to the provisions of this chapter; and
such probate judge, on good cause shown, may require such assignee
to give bail according to the provisions of this chapter; and in case 
such assignee shall fail to appear as required by such citation, or shall
fail to give bail within the time ordered by such probate judge, such
probate judge shall remove him and appoint another trustee, and after
the giving bail by any assignee, or trustee so appointed, as provided in
this section, the same proceeding shall be had as provided in this chapter 
in case of assignments hereafter made. [56 v. 231, ~ 21.] 
SEC. 6346. Every assignee, or trustee appointed on the assignee
failing to qualify, shall within thirty days after giving bond, cause 
notice to be given in some newspaper of general circulation in the
county, for three successive weeks, of his appointment as such assignee

SEC. 6347. Immediately upon the assignee giving bond, or if the
.assignee fail to give bond, then upon the trustee appointed by the 
court giving bond, the court shall appoint three suitable, disinterested
persons appraisers of the property and assets of the assignor; and the
said assignee or trustee shall, within thirty days after giving bond, unless for good cause shown the court shall allow a longer time, make 
.and file in the court an inventory, verified by his oath, of all the property, monies, rights, and credits of the assignor included in the assign- 
ment, which shall have come to his possession or knowledge, together
with an appraisement thereof by said appraisers under their oath: provided, however, that if any part of said estate or effects be in any
other county, the assignee Or trustee may have appraisers as to such 
part of the estate and effects, appointed by any disinterested justice of
·such county; and provided, further, that if the assignment includes 
real estate situate without this state, it shall not be necessary to have
-such real estate appraised, but the assignee, or trustee appointed by the

good faith and for a fair price; and at the time of filing the inventory,
the assignee or trustee shall also file a schedule of all the debts and 
liabilities of the assignor within his knowledge, which schedule shall be
verified by the oath of the assignee or trustee; which schedule shall 
contain the post-office address of each of such alleged creditors as far
as the same can be given. (56 v, 231, § 3, 4; 68 v. 41, § 1.] 
SEC. 6348. No assignment for the benefit of creditors shall be
construed to include or cover any property exempt from levy or sale 
on execution, or from ~eing by a_ny legal process ap~lied. to the pay­
ment of debts, unless in the assignment the exemption is expressly 
waived, or any property belonging to the wife of the assignor, nor to
require the assignor to deliver up any of such property; and as to the
homestead exemption, and exempt property that has to be selected by
the debtor and his wife, the appraisers appointed by the court shall, on
making the appraisement, set the same off in the same way that appraisers of property levied on or attached are required to do; and if, for any
reason, this setting off is then omitted, the court may at any time
thereafter; and before sale, order the same to be done by the iippraisers. 
[58 V. 3, ~ I 5·]
Ssc. 6349. The probate judge may, on the application of the 
assignee, or of any creditor, or without any application, at all times
require the assignor, upon reasonable notice, to attend and to submit 
to an examination on oath upon all matters relating to the disposal of
nis property, to his trade and dealings with others, and his accounts
concerning the same, to all debts due or claimed from him, and to all
other matters concerning his property and estate, and the due settle­
ment thereof according to law, which examination may, at the request
of any party to the proceeding, be reduced to writing; and the said
probate judge may, in like manner, at any time before the final settle­
ment of the accounts of the assignee, require the attendance of the
assignee, or any other person as a witness, and examine him or her
upon oath, as to all matters appertaining to the estate of the assignor
or to the administration of the said trust; and the said probate judge
may, upon or after such examination, make and enforce any orders
upon proper parties, which he may deem necessary to prevent any 
fraudulent transfer or change in the property or effects of the assignor
or the allowance or payment of any unjust or fraudulent claim out of 
his estate. r 69 V. I72, § I 2.] 
SEC. 6350. The assignee or trustee shall proceed at once to convert all the assets received by him into money, and to sell the real and 
. . 
personal property assigned, including stocks, and such bonds, notes.
and other claims as are not due, and which can not probably be col­
lected within a reasonable time, either for cash, or upon such other
terms as the court may order, at public auction, at such time and place
as may be designated in notice given by advertisement in some news­
paper of general circulation within the county, for four successive
weeks, and of which sale due return shall be made to the judge; but
all such sales of real estate shall be made at not less than two-thirds the
appraised value thereof, being subject to re .. ppraisement as upon execu­
tions at law, and such sale shall be set aside, or confirmed, as the court
shall order; and if confirmed, deeds shall be made to the purchasers,
conveying the title free from all liens on the same for all debts due by
the assignor. Whenever the court shall be satisfied that it would be for
the advantage of the creditors of the assignor to sell any part of the
real or personal property assigned, at private sale, the court may author­
ize the assignee or trustee to thus sell the same, either for cash, or upon
such other terms as the court may order ; but such real estate shall, in
no case, be sold for less than two-thirds its appraised value; nor shall such
personal property be sold for less than two-thirds of such appraisernent,
unless the court shall, upon good cause shown, order the assignee to
sell the same for a less amount; and a return of such sale shall be 
made within the time prescribed by the court ; and such sale shall be
confirmed by the court before the same shall be complete and binding;
and if confirmed, deeds shall be made of the real estat-, to the purchas­
ers, conveying the title, free from all liens or. the same, ior all debts
due by the assignor. Should any property thus crdered to be sold at
private sale, be not so sold within the time prescribed by the court,
then the court shall order the same to Le sold at public auction, in the
same manuer as though a private sale had not been ordered; and the
assignee, or trustee may with the approval of the court compromise or 
sell any claim or demand on behalf of the assignor which is desperate,
or of difficult collection; and he may, also, with the approval of the
probate court, complete and enforce all sales of real estate made by the 
assignor, making all needful conveyances for that purpose: provided,

SEc. 6415. Appropriations can only be made when the corpora­
tion is unable to agree with the owner, or his guardian or trustee, as to
the compensation to be paid for the property sought to be appropriated,
or when the owner is incapable of contracting in person or by agent,
and has no guardian or trustee, or is unknown, or his residence is 
beyond the state, or unknown. [ 69 v. 88, § 2.] 
SEc. 6416. In any such case the corporation may file with the pro­
bate judge a petition, verified as in a civil action, containing a specific
description of each parcel of property, interest, or right, within the
county, sought to be appropriated, the work, if any, intended to be con­
structed thereon, the use to which the same is to be applied, the neces­
sity for the appropriation, the name of the owner of each parcel, if
known, or if not known, a statement of that fact, the names of all per­
sons having or claiming an interest, legal or equitable, in the property,

tion of the property. [ 69 v. 88, § 2, I 9.]

owner is resident, and if no owner is resident therein, it may be filed in 
either. [ 7 2 v. 7 I , § 1.] 
SEC. 6418. Upon the filing of a precipe therefore, the probate judge
shall issue summons for the owners, and persons named in the petition
as residents of the state and having an interest, which may be directed
to the sheriff of any county, and shall command him to notify the per­
sons named therein of the filing of the petition, and to appear thereto
at a time to be fixed by the judge, and named therein, not less than five
nor more than fifteen days from the date thereof, and which shall be
-served and returned as in a civil action. When a writ is returned 
"not summoned," other writs may be issued, until the parties are duly
summoned. [72 v. 71, § 1.] . 
SEc. 6419. When a person having an interest is unknown, or his
residence is beyond the state, or unknown, the corporation may make ser­
vice by publication against him, by publishing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county where the petition is filed, for four consecu­
tive weeks, a notice containing a summary statement of the object and
prayer of the petition, so far as it relates to the property of the person
thus to be notified, the court in which it is filed, and the time when such
person is to appear thereto, not less than ten nor more than twenty days 
after the last publication; and the fact of publioation may be proved
by the affidavit of any person knowing the same. J12 v, 71, § 1.] 
SEc. 6420. On the day named in any summons rstserved, or publi­
cation first completed, the probate judge shall hear and determine the 
questions of the existence of the corporation, its right to make the
appropriation, its inability to agree with the owner, and the necessity for
the appropriation. Upon these questions the burden of proof shall be
upon the corporation, and any interested person shall be heard. (72 v. 
71, § 1.] 
SEC. 6421. If the judge determine these questions for the corporation, as to any or all of the property, and persons interested therein, 
he shall issue an order to the clerk and sheriff to draw sixteen names
from the jury box, as in other cases, and within two days after the
receipt of the same, they shall execute the order, and the clerk shall
forthwith return it to the probate judge, with a list of the names drawn
indorsed thereon; and the judge shall issue to the sheriff a venire for
the jurors so drawn to attend at his office, at a time to be fixed by him,
and named in the writ, not exceeding ten days from the date thereof,
which shall be served and returned as in other cases. [72 v. 71, § 
3, 4.] 
SEC. 6422. The owners of each separate parcel, right, or interest,
shall be entitled to a separate trial by jury, verdict, and judgment. 
They shall hold the affirmative on the trial, which shall be conducted,
and evidence shall be admitted, and bills of exception may be taken,
as provided in civil actions. (69 v. 88, § 8, 12, 23; 72 v. 71, §~ 1, 3.] 
SEC. 6423. The court may amend any defect or informality in any
of the proceedings authorized or required by this chapter, or cause 
new parties to be added, and direct such further notice to be given to
any party in interest as it deems proper. [ 69 v. 88, § 17.] 
SEC. 6424. The court may direct the order and fix the time of the
several trials,· ma}' adjourn or continue any· trial for the purpose of 
obtaining proper service upon any property owner, or when deemed
necessary for the proper and convenient trial of the several cases; and
may discharge any jury, and cause other juries to be empaneled, as pro­
vided in this chapter. [72 v. 72, § 3.] 
SEC. 6425. When, by reason of non-attendance, sickness, or other
f h · d · d' · 
cause, any o t c sixteen persons are not present an in con 1t10n to

delivery of such property, and the payment of the amount owing by 
the garnishee, into the court; or may permit the garnishee to retain the
property or the amount owing, upon the execution of an undertaking

tiff; or if he fail to comply with the order of the Justice to dehver the
property and pay the money owing, into court, or give the undertaking
required in the preceding section, the plaintifff may proceed against him
in an action, in his own name, as in other cases ; and, thereupon, such
proceedings may be had as in other actions, and judgment may be rendered in favor of the plaintifff, for the amount of the property and
credits of every kind of the defendant in the possession of the garnishee, and for what shall appear to be owing by him to the defendant,
and for the costs of the proceedings against the garnishee ; if · the
plaintifff proceed against the garnishee by action, for the cause that his
disclosure was unsatisfactory, unless it appear in the action that such
disclosure was incomplete, the plain tiff shall pay the costs of such
action ; the judgment in this action may be enforced as judgments in
other cases; when the claims of the plaintifffs in attachment are satisfied, the defendant in attachment may, on motion, be substituted as

taking for an appeal to the court of common pleas, which time shall
not exceed ten days, during which time, so fixed by the justice, the
property shall not be returned to the defendant, and in case of appeal
by either party, the attachment shall be continued in and determined
by the court of common pleas in the same manner as though said

ment, shall be sold by order of the justice, under the same restrictions
and regulations as if the same had been levied on by execution ; and
the money arising therefrom, with the amount which may be recovered 
from the garnishee, shall be applied to satisfy the judgment and costs; 
if there be not enough to satisfy the same, the judgment shall stand,
and execution may issue thereon, for the residue, in all respects as
in other cases; any surplus of the attached property, or its proceeds, 
shall he returned to the defendant, [51 v. 179, § 46.) 
SEC. 6508. The justice may order the constable to repossess him­
self, for the purpose of selling it, of any of the attached property, which

same power to take the property, as he would have under an order of 
attachment. [51 v. 179~ § 47.)

claimed by any person other than the defendant, the claimant may have

written notice to appear; but when property is attached in the hands of
a consignee, or other person having a prior lien, his liens thereon shall
not be affected by the attachment. [51 v. I 79, § 51. l

affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of
the justice, the attachment in such action shall be discharged, and resti­
tution made of any property taken under it, or the proceeds thereof;
such undertaking shall also discharge the liability of a garnishee in such
action, for any property of the defendant in his hands. [51 v. 179, 
§ 52.] 
SEC. 6514. If in any case where an order of attachment has been
issued by a justice of the peace, it shall appear from the return of the 
officer, and if there is a garnishee in the case, then also from the examination of the garnishee, that no property, monies, rights, credits, or 
effects of the defen~ant have been take!l under .the attachmen.t, but
that the defendant is the owner of an interest m real estate m the 
county, the justice before whom said action is pending shall, at the
request of the plaintifff, forthwith certify his proceedings to the court of
common pleas of the proper county, and thereupon the clerk of the
court of common pleas shall docket said cause, and the action shall be 
proceeded with in all respects as if the same had originated therein,
except that in all actions under this section, for any sum of which justices of the peace have exclusive original jurisdiction, if the defendant

the action, a sum greater than the offer, he can not recover costs
accrued after the offer, but costs must be adjudged against him; but
the offer and failure to accept it, can not be given in evidence to affect
the recovery otherwise than as to costs as above provided. [ 62 v. 17,

of the plaintifff, a written undertaking to the defendant in at least double 
the value of the property taken, but in no case less than fifty dollars,
to the effect that the plaintifff shall duly prosecute the action and pay
all costs and damages which may be awarded against him. In all cases
where the property replevied consists of heir-looms, personal keepsakes,
or other article of property, the value of which consists, in whole or in
part, in its being a relic, model, gift, family picture, painting, or rare
production of art or nature, and not wholly in its general marketable
character, the constable shall retain and safely keep the same, subject
to the order of the court: provided, the defendant, his agent, or attorney,
shall, on or before the time named in the summons for trial, file his
motion, in writing, with the justice of the peace (which said motion
shall be heard and determined before the trial, or before the said justice
shall certify the proceedings to the court of common pleas, as herein, 
after provided), for an order requiring the constable to retain said prop­
erty, subject to the final order of the court: provided further, that in
case the defendant does not file said motion, or the court, upon applica­
tion of either party, refuses to order the constable to retain said prop­
erty, for the reason that it does not belong to one or more of the kinds
of personal property aforesaid, the constable shall deliver said property
to the plaintifff, his agent, or attorney, upon the execution of an under­
taking as hereinbefore provided, within one day after the expiration of
the time for filing said motion, or, in case said motion is filed, within
one day after the refusal of the justice to order the constable to retain
the property as aforesaid; and, provided, further, in case the appraised
value of the property exceeds three hundred dollars, or in case an ap­
peal is taken from the final judgment and order of the justice of the
peace, the said justice shall order the constable to turn over the prop­
erty in his possession to the sheriff of his county, to be by said sheriff
held as in like cases originating in the court of common pleas. (65 v. 
143, § 143· l 
SEC. 6617. For the purpose of fixing the amount of the undertaking, the value of the property taken shall be ascertained by the oath
of· two responsible persons, whom the constable shall swear truly to 
assess the value thereof. [SI v. 179, § 144. l 
SEC. 6618. Whenever the appraised value of the property so taken
shall exceed three hundred dollars, the justice shall certify the proceedings in the case to the court of common pleas of his county, and thereupon shall file the original papers, together with a certified transcript of

security within the time aforesaid, or if he take insufficient security, he
shall be liable to the defendant in damages. (51 v. 179, § 146.] 
SF.c. 6620. In all cases where judgment is rendered against the
plaintifff, or if he otherwise fail to prosecute his action to final judgment, 
the justice shall, on application of the defendant, or his attorney, impanel a jury to inquire into the right of property, and right of possession of the defendant to the property taken. If the jury shall be
satisfied the said property was the property of the defendant at the com­
mencement of the action, or if they find that the defendant was entitled
to the possession only of the same at such time, then, and in either
case, they shall assess such damages for the defendant as are right and
proper, for which, with costs of suit, the justice shall render judgment
for the defendant, and the justice shall also order any property in the
possession of the constable to be delivered to the defendant. [65 v. 
143, ~ 147. l 
SEC. 66~1. In all cases where the property has been delivered to
the plaintifff, when the jury shall find for the defendant, they shall also 
find whether the defendant had the right of property, or the right of 
 
possession only, at the commencement of the suit; and if they find
either in his favor, they shall assess such damages as they think right
and proper for the defendant, for which, with costs of suit, the court
shall render judgment for the defendant. In all cases where property
remains in the hands of the constable, as hereinbefore provided, the
jury shall find which party had the right of property and right of
possession, or right of possession only, at the commencement of the
suit; and if they find either in favor of the plaintifff or defendant, they
shall assess such damages as they think right and proper for the pre­
vailing party, for which, with costs of suit, the court shall render judg­
ment, and also order the constable to deliver such property to the party 
in whose favor judgment is rendered. [65 v. 143, § 148.) 
SEc. 6622. In a11 cases, when the property has been delivered to
the plaintifff, where the jury shall find for the plaintifff, on trial, or on

the justice shall render judgment against the defendant. [S 7 v. 
179, § 149.l 
SEC. 66~3. When the property claimed has not been taken, or has
been returned to the defendant, for want of the undertaking required 
by section sixty-six hundred and sixteen, the action may proceed as one
for damages only, and the plaintifff shall be entitled to such damages
as are right and proper; but if the property be returned for want of
the undertaking required by said section, the plaintifff shall pay all costs
made by taking the same. ls I v. 1 79, § 150. l 
6624. The constable, in executing tfie writ, may break open
any building or enclosure, in which the property claimed, or any part
thereof, is concealed ; but not until he has been refused an entrance
into said building or enclosure, and the delivery of the property, after 
having demanded the same. (51 v. 179, ~ 151.] 
SEC. 6625. No suit shall be instituted on the undertaking given
on the delivery of the property to plaintifff, before an execution issued 
on a judgment in favor of the defendant in the action shall have been
returned, that sufficient property, whereon to levy and make the amount
of such judgment, can not be found in the county. [51 v. 179, ~ 152.] 
6626. If any justice shall issue a writ to replevin property,
as is provided by this chapter, without the affidavit being made and
filed m his office, as is provided in section sixty-six hundred and thirlttn, 
the same shall be set aside at his costs, and he shall be liable in dama­
ges to the party injured. [51 v. 179, § 153.]

appr~hensive that, by delaying the execution until the expira~ion of the 
full time of such stay, he or she may be compelled to pay the Judgment,
it shall be lawful for such suretv to make and file affidavit of that fact,
before the justice on whose doc.ket the judgment is entered; whereupon,
such justice shall issue execution against the judgment debtor, which
shall be proceeded in as in other cases: provided, such bail shall not
thereby be discharged from liability, but may be proceeded against after
the expiration of the term of stay, in the manner as if execution had 
not issued as aforesaid. [SI v. 179, § 161.] 
SEC. 6658. If the judgment debtor shall, within ten days after
levying such execution, enter into a further undertaking for the stay of
execution, during so much of the first stay as remains then unexpired,

recall the execution; and the person who last became surety shall first
be proceeded against, until it shall appear, by the return of the constable, that he or she has no goods and chattels whereon to levy, before

179, § 162.] 
SEC. 6659. When any judgment shall be obtained against any
person who shall have entered himself bail on the docket of any justice
of the peace, agreeably to the provisions of this title, the original judg- 
ment shall remain good and valid in law, for the use of such bail; who,
at any time thereafter, may sue out execution, on such judgment, against 
the goods and chattels of the defendant for the use of such bail, which
shall be so indorsed by the justice, and such bail shall also be entitled
to a transcript of such judgment, for his own use; which shall have the 
same force and effect as transcripts in other cases. [51 v. 179, § 163.]

taking the surety, or his successor in office, shall become satisfied that 
the surety is insufficient, it shall be his duty to cause written notice
thereof to be given to the defendant, or if he be absent, that the same
be left at his residence, requiring him to give additional surety. If
such defendant shall not have given such additional surety, on or by the
third day after the giving of such notice, such fact shall be entered on
the docket, and he shall immediately issue execution against the defendant for the collection of the judgment. If within ten days after
the issuing of such execution, surety to the satisfaction of the justice be
given, the execution shall be recalled and stayed until the expiration of

quence of the justice who may have rendered judgment being unable
to issue by reason of sickness, absence, or any other cause; and must
bear date the day of its delivery to the officer to be executed. It must
intelligibly refer to the judgment, by stating the names of the parties,
and the name of the justice before whom, and of the county and town­
ship where, and the time when, it was rendered; the amount of the
judgment, and if less than the whole is clue, the true amount thereon,
as follows: 
1. If it be a case where the defendant can not be arrested, it inust
direct the officer to collect the amount of the judgment out of the
personal property of the debtor, and pay the same to the party entitled
thereto. 
2. If it be a case where any of the judgment debtors are certified
on the docket as surety, it shall command that the money be made of
the personal property of the principal debtor, and for want thereof, of
the personal property of the surety. In such cases the personal prop­
erty of the principal, subject to execution within the jurisdiction, shall
be exhausted before any of the property of the bail shall be taken in 
execution. 
3 If it be a case where the defendant may be arrested in addition
to the foregoing. it must direct the officer, if sufficient property cf the
defendant, subject to the execution, can not be found to satisfy the judg­
ment, that he arrest the debtor, and commit him to the jail of the county,

execution be accompanied by an order of arrest, as hereinafter pro­
vided.

SEC. 6664. Upon an execution on a judgment against joint debtors,
upon one or more of whom the summons was not served, the execution

judgment be also such that the defendants are subject to arrest thereon, 
the justice must further specify the names of those defendants served
with the summons, who may be arrested for want of property. [51 v.

evidence thereof to authorize his discharge by the jailer. [51 v. 179, 
§ 170.] 
SEC. 6668. A constable is liable to the party in whose favor an
execution issued to him for the amount thereof, in the following cases :

directed by the party for whom the execution issued. commence an ac- 
tion on the undertaking for the stay of execution, and, so soon as judgment is obtained thereon, shall issue execution, and if such execution
be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, for want of goods or chattels of the bail whereon to levy, then the plaintifff may demand and
have execution on the original judgment, for the amount remaining 
due. [51 v. 179, ~ 172.l 
SEC. 6670. Where Dail is given for the stay of execution. and the

performance of an act which the law specia11y enjoins as a duty result­
ing from anoffice, trust, or station. (51 v. 57, § 569.] 
SEC. 6742. The writ can only be issued by the supreme court or
the district court; and although it may require an inferior tribunal to 
exercise its judgment, or to proceed to the discharge of any of its func­
tions, it can not control judicial discretion. [51 v. 57, § 570.] 
SEc. 6743. The application for the writ must be by petition, in the
name of the state, on the relation of the person applying, and verified
by affidavit; and the court may require a notice of the application to
be given to the defendant, or may grant an order to show cause why it
should not be al1owed, or may allow the writ without notice. ls I v. 
57, § 573.) 
SEC. 6744. The writ must not be issued in a case where there is a
plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. It may
issue on the information of the party beneficially interested. [SI v. 
57, § 570.] 
SEC. 6745. When the right to require the performance of the act
is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not per­
forming it, a court may, in the first instance, allow a peremptory man­
damus; and in all other cases an alternative writ must first he issued, 
on the allowance of the court, or a judge thereof. [51 v. 57, ~ 572.] 
SEC. 6746. The allowance of the writ, and an order that the
defendant, immediately upon service, do the act required to be per­
formed, or, when an alternative writ is allowed, that he do the act, or
show cause before the court. at a specified time and place, why he does 
not do the act, shall he entered on the journal. [51 v. 57, 574.J 
SEC. 674 7. The writ shall be issued by the clerk of the court in
which the application is made, and shall contain a copy of the petition, 
verification, and order of allowance, and shall be served upon the
defendant, personally, by copy, by the sheriff of the proper county, or 
by a person specially authorized by the court or judge; such officer or
person shall report his proceedings therewith to the court; and if the
service be made by a person not an officer, the return must be verified 
by his affidavit. f 51 v. 57, § 571.] 
SEC. 6748. On the return day of an alternative writ, or such further day as the court may allow, the defendant may answer as in a civil 
action; or, if the writ be allowed by a single judge, he may demur.

SEC. 6750. If no answer be made, a peremptory mandamus must
be allowed against the defendant. [51 v. 57, § 576.]

and the further proceedings thereon had, in the same manner as in 
civil actions. [51 v. 57, § 577.] 
SEC. 6753. If judgment be given for the plaintifff, the relator may
recover the damages which he has sustained, to be ascertained by the 
court, or a jury, or by a referee or master, as in a civil action, and
costs; and a peremptory mandamus shall also be granted to him with- 
out delay. (51 v. 57§ 578.] 
SEC. 6754. Such recovery of damages against a defendant shall
be a bar to any other action upon such cause of action. (51 v. 5 7, 3 
579.] 
SEC. 6755. If judgment be given for the defendant, all costs shall
be adjudged against the relator. 
SF.c. 6756. When a peremptory mandamus has been directed to a
public officer, body, or board, commanding the performance of a public duty specially enjoined by law, and the court finds that such officer, 
or any member of such body or board, has, without just excuse, refused
or neglected to perform the duty so enjoined, the court may impose a
fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, upon such officer or member;
and such fine, when collected, shall be paid into the treasury of the
county wherein the duty ought to have been performed, and the payment thereof shall be a bar to an action for any penalty incurred by
such officer or member by reason of such refusal or neglect. [SI v. 
57§58o.1 .

such officers ha ve resigned, or refuse or neglect to levy and assess such
tax, or their offices arc vacant, the court, upon the motion of an inter­
ested person. and upon being satisfied of the fact of such resignation,
vacancy. or refusal or neglect to levy such tax, and of the right of such
person to have the same levied and assessed, may cause a special order
to be issued to the auditor of the proper county, commanding him to
levy and assess upon the taxable property of the county, township. or
municipal corporation the taxes required by law, or the judgment or
order of said court, to be levied and assessed for the purposes aforesaid,
and to place the same upon the duplicate for collection by the county 
treasurer. [63 v. 15, ~ 1.] 
SEC. 6758. When such special order is issued to the auditor he
shall be responsible for the execution thereof in the same manner as if
he were an officer of the court; and he shall receive such fees for his
services in executing the order, if not otherwise fixed by the court, as
he is allowed by law for making tax duplicates; which fees, and all other
costs of the proceeding. he shall add to the taxes levied in executing
such order, and place the same upou the duplicate for collection with
such taxes. [ 63 v. 15, ~ 2.] 
SEc. 6759. The provisions of the last two sections shall not be
construed to limit the power of the court to carry its order and judg­
ment into execution, or to punish any officer named therein for con­
tempt or disobedience of its orders or writs. (63 v. 15, § 3.]
