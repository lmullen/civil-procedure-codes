of this act for the commencement of actions shall be as
follows:—

Within ten years, action for the recovery of real prop

no action shall be maintained for such recovery unless it
appear that the plaintifff, his ancestor, predecessor, or ,
grantor was seised or possessed of the premises in ques- :

action; provided, that in all cases where a cause of action

has already accrued, and the period prescribed in this

of this act, an action may be brought on such cause of

to aver it in an action on such an
instrument: Paddock v. Hume, 6 Or.

The following are examples of im
material varinuce: Where an immate

might be regarded as sur lusage—is
not proved: Sacramento '0. v. Bird,
31 Cal. 73. Mere differences in quan
tity or extent do not create material
variances: Peasley v. Hart, 3 West
Coast Rep. 623. So where the vari

prejudice, in maintaining his action

or defense upon the merits: Hill v.

Iloppelkom v. Ilqjfman, 12 Neb. 99;

A failure of proof is more than a
material variance, and cannot be rem
edied by amendment: See § 93 [96],
past, and note. This occurs where no
cause of action or defense whatever has
been proved: Dunn v. Durant, 9 Daly,

those mentioned in section 108 [106]; and shall also
make and ﬁle with such clerk an undertaking, with one
or more sureties, in a sum not less than one hundred

dollars, and equal to the amount for which the plaintifff
prays judgment. Such undertaking shall be conditioned
that the plaintifff will pay all costs that may be adjudged
to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain
by reason of the arrest, if the some he wrongful or with

nature and sources of the information upon which the

belief is founded. The pla,intiﬂ' shall also ﬁle with his

3. The writ of arrest shall be issued by the clerk, and
shall require the sheriff of any county where the defend-I

ant may be found, forthwith to arrest him and hold him
to bail in the amount speciﬁed in the undertaking, and
that in default thereof, he keep him in custody until
discharged by law, and to return the writ to the clerk
from whom it issued, with his doings indorsed thereon,

the clerk of the court in which the action is pending,

1. That the defendant is indebted to the plaintifff
(specifying the amount of such indebtedness over and

expressed or implied, for the direct payment of money,
and that the payment of the same has not been secured
by any mortgage, lien, or pledge upon real or personal
property; and,
2. That the sum for which the attachment is asked is

2. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of é)fg.311.1as2,

as to whether one must have expressed

Under this statute, having formed
an opinion must be suﬂicient cause
of challenge, for the words of the
statute are “formed or expressed.”
And again, the conﬂict as to whether
merely having expressed an opinion
is sufficient cause of challenge, is
cleared n by the provision of the
statute, t at no opinion formed or
expressed shall be sufficient unless

Bills of exceptions. —- The object
of a. bill of exceptions is to bring into
the record what would not otherwise
appear, so as to lay the

p
' gs in error, and or the in
ormation of the ap llate court:

the acts and conduct of the court, but

not of its ofﬁcers.

Where the objec

party should call upon the court for

The bill of exception is the proper to ask the court to decide as counsel
menu to bring in for consideration may desire, and upon a. refusal, to have it notedin the bill of exceptions:
Griswold v. Sharpe, 2 Cal. 23.
When the same evidence has been
several times objected to, and ruled
out by the court, there is no need to
repeat the objection on every repeti
tion of the question. The court may
properly treat the objection as continuing on every repetition of the
question, unless something transpires

to show that it is waived: People v.
Melmne, 39 Cal. 617.

Taking a nonsuit is not a waiver of
exce tions taken: Natoma etc. Co. v.
Clar ‘in, 14 Cal. 5-14.

The point of the exception shall be particularly stated, and may be delivered, in writing, to the
judge, or entered in his minutes, and at the time or
afterwards, be corrected until made conformable to the

truth. If an objection is made to any ruling of the
court in the progress of a trial, and the truth of the
statement thereof is not agreed upon between the coun
sel and the court, the counsel may verify his statement

thereof, by his own oath and that of two respectable and
disinterested by-standers, and ﬁle the same as an excep
tion to the ruling objected to. Such statement must be
ﬁled within the day that the objection is made, and not
otherwise.

Within one day thereafter, the adverse party

may ﬁle a statement of the objection as prepared or
approved by the court, together with the affidavits of not
more than three respectable and disinterested by-standers
concerning the truth or falsity of the statement of the

exception as ﬁled by the, counsel, and prepared or ap
proved by the court.

Each statement of the exception,

and all afﬁdavits concerning either of them when ﬁled
as herein required, shall be deemed a part of the record
of the cause, and upon an appeal or review, the appel

late court must ﬁrst ascertain therefrom the truth of
the matter, as far as possible, and then determine the
law arising thereon. The court must allow the counsel
a reasonable time to procure the veriﬁcation of his state

ment as herein required; and all atﬁdavits of by-standers
shall be taken by the clerk of the court, who must certify
thereon, if he is satisﬁed of the fact that the by-stander
is respectable and disinterested.
Exceptions how taken.-The

exception must be taken at the time
the error occurs or it will be presumed

to have been waived: Rogue River

Jlining Co. v. Walker, 1 Or. 341; and
unless an exception be reserved, even

though an objection be made, the
objection is waived and cannot after son v. W. P. R. R. 00., 48 Id. 425; Oct. 11, 1862,

that subject: Rogers v. Mahoney, 62

forcible entry and detainer that the
supreme court would not review the
question of damages on the ground
that the proof did not warrant them;
defendant should either have moved

for a new trial or speciﬁed in his bill
of exceptions in what particulars the
evidence did not justiiy the decision
in this respect, and have brought up
the evidence on this point: Jones v.
Shay, 50 Id. 508.

§ 232. [229.] No particular form of exception shall be g2_c3.9'11,1862,

The objection shall be stated with so much

of the evidence or other matter as is necessary to explain
it, but no more.
Form of exception.—The rule
generally in regard to the bill of
exceptions is thus stated in Estate of
Page, 57 Cal. 238, 239: "To make it
[an exception] eﬁcctual in a. bill of
exceptions, the objection should be
stated, and also the round upon
which it was made. If it was not
upon grounds of error of law, the
proper mode in an action tried by the

to decide what counsel may consider

a mistake in his testimony except

O'Kelly v. Felker, 71 Ga. 775; Scoﬁcld

prise as will justify the court in grant
mg a. new trial: Tyler v. Hoornln-ck,
48 Barb. 198; and see Continental Na

tional Bank v. Adams, 67 Id. 318.
The mere fact that a party's own
witness gives testimony different from
what the arty ex cted him to ‘ve
does not urnish equate groun for
granting a new trial on the
nd of
surprise: Guard v. Risk, 11

Grader v. Fowler, 7 Blackf. 554;
S roul v. Fire Ins. Co., 1 Lane. 71;
Le of Carlery, 56 Cal. 470; Schultz
v. Third Av. R. R. 00., 15 Jones & S.

285. But the cases agree that a party
may be entitled to s. new trial on the
ground of surprise, caused by his
own witness testifying diﬁerently
from what he had the right reason
ably to expect, where no want of
diligence in guardin against such
surprise is attributab e to him, and
where it is shown that he is injured
thereby: Todd v. State, 25 Ind. 212;

Rolling Jllill Co. v. Slate, 54 Id. 635;

nor is it round for a new trial that a
witness as testified without being
sworn, unless it appears that the evi

dence was material and not true, and
that the party against whom the wit
ness testiﬁcd was not guilty of laches
in permitting him to testify without
being sworn: Slzeeks v. Shecks, 98 Ind.
288.
A party cannot be surprised by the
other making good by proof a fact
distinctly put in issue by the lead
ings: Armstrong v. Davis, 41 Ca 499.
Nor is it a ground of legal surprise for
a part to produce oral testimony
ins
of depositions that have been
taken: Heath v. Scott, 65 Cal. 548.

A mistake of law cannot operate as 8
surprise: Fuller v. Hutchins, 10 Cal.
526; S. C., 70 Am. Dec. 746; K106589
baum v. Pierson, 22 Cal. 163.

If a party omit to pay his attorney
after being informed that he will not conduct the case unless his fees are
paid, and judgment goes by default
in consequence, the party is not “ sur

448. So, generally, it is not surpnse
where judgment goes against a. party
for non-attendance of his attorney,

Duty of court and jury.—A
full statement of what matters are for
the court and what for the jury can
not be inserted here. But cases illus
trating who is to decide particular
matters will be found throughout the
code under the various titles. A few
instances are here given.
W'hcre one of the witnesses deposed
to a state of facts which n on'his
cross-examination proved to e hear
say evidence and wholly inadmissible,
and the court ordered the testimony
of the witness to be stricken out, and

instructed the jury to disregard it,
the supreme court held there was no
error: Parker v. Smith, 4 Cal. 105.

of reasonable or unreasonable in point
of fact. In such cases the legal con
clusion follows the inference of facts;
in other words, the question as to
reasonable time, etc., is one of fact,

and the time is reasonable or unrea
sonable in point of law aceordiugto
the ﬁnding of the jury in point of fact:
Luckhart v. Ogden, 30 Id. 548.

The jury must determine whether
a witness whose declarations are
sought to be used against a party is
that party’s agent or not; Biggerstaf
v. Brig;/.9, 3 West Coast Rep. 353.
The better practice is to decide upon
the admissibility of evidence when it
is offered; but if the rule be departed
from, it is clearly the duty of the
court, at a subse uent stage of‘the
case, to rule upon t e oint distinctly,

When the time for answering the complaint has expired, and it appears that the defendant, or one or more
of several defendants, in the cases mentioned in section

60 [59], has been duly served with the summons and has
failed to answer the complaint, the plaintifff shall be en

titled to have judgment against such defendant or de
fend-ants,—
1. In an action arising upon contract for the recovery
of money or damages only; if no answer has been ﬁled
with the clerk of the court within the time speciﬁed in
the snmmons,_or such further time as may have been

granted by the court or judge thereof, the clerk, upon
the application of the plaintifff made in writing and ﬁled
with the clerk, shall enter the default of the defendant,

and immediately thereafter enter judgment for the
amount speciﬁed in the summons, including the costs of

the defendant, or against one or more of several defend
ants, in cases provided for in section 60 [59];

2. In other actions, if no answer has been ﬁled with
the clerk of the court within the time speciﬁed in the
summons, or such further time as may have been granted
by the court or judge thereof, the clerk shall, upon the
written motion of the plaintifff being ﬁled, enter the de
fault of the defendant, and thereafter the plaintifff may
apply at the ﬁrst or any subsequent term of the court
for the relief demanded in the complaint; and the court

shall, upon such demand, give judgment for the amount
claimed in the summons, or the relief demanded in the

complaint, unless it be necessary, to enable the court to
give judgment or carry the same into effect, to take proof

of any matter of fact, in which case the court may order
the entry of judgment to be delayed until such proof be
taken.

The court may hear the proof itself, or make an

order of reference, or that a jury be called to inquire
thereof;
3. When the defendant has answered, and admits the
plaintifff’s claim, but sets up a counterclaim amounting

to less than the plaintifff’s claim, the plaintifff, on motion, ‘
shall have judgment for the excess of his claim over such
counterclaim, as for want of answer thereto;

4. When in any action the service of the summons
appears to have been made by publication, the court

may, in its discretion, order the entry ofjudgment to be
delayed until the plaintifff ﬁle with the clerk an under- .
taking, with one or more sureties, to be approved by the
clerk, in an amount equal to the sum for which judg
ment may be given, upon the condition that the plaintifff

will abide by and perform any order of the court requir
ing restitution to be made to the defendant or his repre
sentative in case either of them shall afterwards be
admitted to defend the action. The sureties in the
undertaking shall have the qualiﬁcations of bail, and

action, and although the estate or

Bills in equity. -—The code, by
dis using with the classification of
b' s in equity, has not taken sway the
right of suitors to present an cause
of suit that formerly could
preseated by any form of bill: Healherly
v. Hadley. 4 Or. 1.
Cross-bills. — See generally on
the subject of cross-bills the note to
Hard v. Case, 83 Am. Dec. 251 ct
seq. Under the statute as party may
rely upon a legal defense in an action
without being thereby precluded from
afterwards asserting his equitable title
in an original suit: Hill v. Cooper, 6
Or. 181. When an answer sets up a
full and complete legal defense to an
action, a cross-bill in equity cannot
be ﬁled under this section: Dolph v.
Barney, 5 Id. 19]; Srhclami v. 12ppa
elding, 6 Id. 258. When in an action
at law the defendant is entitled to
relief arising out of facts requiring the
interposition of a court of equity, and
such facts are material to his defense
in the action at law, he may set them
out ina cross~bill, although such facts
constitute but a artial defense to the
action atlaw, an are not such ascould
be made the subject of an original bill.
In such case the defendant must be
without a plain, adequate, and com
plate remedy at law: .Hatd:er v.

in title II. of chapter I. of this code; and a suit for the

real property; but no suit shall be maintained to set

direct a sale only of the mortgaged

if the decree direct a sale of more or

Direct evidence is that which proves

§69-1. [(38-1.]

In the construction of a statute or in

strument, the oﬂice of the judge is simply to ascertain
and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained
therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit
what has been inserted; and where there are several
provisions or particulars, such construction is, if possi

ble, to be adopted as will give effect to all.
§ 695. [685.] In the construction of a statute the in
tention of the legislature, and in the construction of an
instrument the intention of the parties, is to be pursued,
if possible; and when a general and particular provision
are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former.

So a particular intent shall control a general one that is
inconsistent with it.

Oral testimony may be given to

It is said that the principle that the

it cannot be proved that there was no

v., sec. 26, note, citing the above

cases. If a. deed does not express
upon its face the fact that a price
was agreed upon and paid for the
property conveyed, the true con
sideration may be proved by parol:
Merle v. Mattlzews, 26 Cal. 455.

The

real consideration on which a. release
was executed may be proved by parol,
notwithstanding the recital of a. con
sideration of one dollar: Stuﬁlcbeem
v. Arnold, 57 Id. 11.

So it may be

shown that there was no considera

Admissions, etc. —Two classes
of admissions, solemn and unsolcmn,

are recognized. Solemn admissions
are those made in a judicial proceed
ing and adopted in lieu of proof, as,
for instance, agreements of counsel as
to existence of certain facts: Kohn v.
Marsh, 1 Rob. (La.) 48; failure to

reply to well-pleaded averments: See
§94 [92], antr;
Coo: v. Parry, 1

ayment into court:
arm Rep. 464. Un

solemn admissions include declara
tions, acts, and conduct generally,
which induce others to act so that if
the person making the admission were
permitted to deny it, injury would

result to the other. Thus one who
willfully deceives another, with intent
to induce him to alter his osition to
his injury or risk, is liab e for any -damage which he thereby suffers. an accountable receipt for property

1. That their power of judging of the effect of evi

dence is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal dis
cretion, and in subordination to the rules of evidence;

2. That they are not bound to ﬁnd in conformity with
the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do
not produce conviction in their minds, against a less
number, or against a presumption or other evidence
satisfying their minds;

.

3. That a witness false in one part of his testimony is
to be distrusted in others;

4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be
viewed with distrust, and the oral admissions of a party
with caution;

5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue shall
be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory, the
ﬁnding shall be according to the preponderance of evi
dence; that in criminal cases guilt shall be established
beyond reasonable doubt;

6. That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its
own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence
which it is in the power of one side to produce and of
the other to contradict; and thereforee,
7. That if the weaker and less satisfactory evidence is
offered when it appears that stronger and more satisfac

offered should be viewed with distrust.

no other suﬁicient circumstances to determine it:—
1. Where there are certain deﬁnite and ascertained

particulars in the description, the addition of others,
which are indeﬁnite, unknown, or false, does not frustrate

the conveyance, but it is to be construed by such partic- ulars, if they constitute a suﬂicient description to ascer
tain its application;
2. When permanent and visible or ascertained boun-t

ldaries or monuments are inconsistent with the measure
ment, either of lines, angles, or surfaces, the boundaries

or monuments are paramount;
3. Between diﬁ'erent measurements which are incon
sistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to
that of surfaces, and that of lines paramount to both;
4. \Vhen a road or stream of water not navigable is
' the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of
the road, or the thread of the stream, are included in the
conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream
is held under another title;

\ 5. When tide-water is the boundary, the rights of the
grantor to low-water mark are included in the convey

ance, and also the right of this state between high and
low water mark;

6. When the description refers to a map, and that
reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it con

trols them, if it appear that the parties acted with refer
ence to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to
other deﬁnite and ascertained particulars.

grand and trial jurors in separate classes. In State v. Lawrence, 12 Or. 297,
the supreme court declared that act unconstitutional, on the ground that it
was in conﬂict with the constitutional requirement that the grand jury must
be drawn from the jurors in attendance. Section 2 appears to be an independent section, not so connected with the provisions declared unconstitutional
as to be involved in the objections to those provisions. The following is the
entire set of February 24, 1885: —
Sscnox 1. See. 927. For the circuit court, not more than ﬁfty-ﬁve nor

posited in said jury-box, upon the order of the county judge previously
ﬁled with the county clerk, specifyin the time when said Jurors are to
attend said county court, and they shal be summoned to attend at the time
speciﬁed in said order; provided, that a jury may be summoned to attend the
county court, by order of the judge thereof, for the trial of an issue in such
court as in the court of a justice of the eace.

SEC. 3. That section 929 of title 3 0 said chapter 12 of said code above
mentioned be amended to read as follows: -—
Section 929. VVhenever jurors are to be drawn, the county clerk shall
take to his assistance the sheriﬁ or a justice of the peace for the county and
proceed with the drawing, as follows: —
l. The clerk shall shake the box containing the ballots so as to mingle
them as much as possible.
2. He shall then publicly draw out of the box as many ballots as there are
jurors required.

3. A mmute of the drawing shall be kept, in which the name contained on
each ballot drawn shall be entered before another ballot can be drawn.
4. If when the whole number of ballots required is drawn it appears that
a person whose name is drawn is dead, or resides out of the count , or does
not possess the necessary qualiﬁcations, or is exempt from jury uty, that
fact shall be entered in the minutes of the drawing and the ballot containing
the name destroyed.
‘
5. Another ballot must then be drawn in the place of that destroyed, and
the name contained thereon shall in the same manner he entered in the min
utes of the drawing.
6. The same proceeding shall be had as often as necessary until the requisite

iallots containing the names of said [persons] until seven of them are drawn,
and the seven so drawn shall be known and denominated as the grand jury
and the remaining as the trial jury.

§ 1039. [1007.]

An attorney has authority,—

1. To bind his client, in any of the proceedings in an
action, suit, or proceeding, by his agreement, ﬁled with

the clerk or entered upon the journal of the court, and
not otherwise;

2. To receive money or property claimed by his client
in an action, suit, or proceeding, during the pendency
thereof, or within three years after judgment or decree,
and upon the payment or delivery thereof, and not other

wise, to discharge the claim or acknowledge satisfaction
of the judgment or decree.
But this section does not prevent a party from
employing a new attorney to issue execution upon 0.

judgment or decree, or to take the other proceedings
prescribed by this code for its enforcement, and when he
does so, the authority of the former attorney ceases.

Id. It is even held that an attorney
may bind his client by an agreement
that jud ment may be taken against
him, alt ough the attorney knew
that his client had a. good defense to
the action: Thompson v. Pershing,
supra. This rule, thus maintained by
a majority of cases, seems to be
opposed to the well-settled American
doctrine, post, that an attorney has no
authority to compromise the cause of
his client.

Indeed, the confession of

judgments and compromise of causes
appear to stand upon the same footing.
Of course, a confession of judgment by

payment to an attorney by the defend
ant, after notice by the client not to

not, by force of such employment,

fund in litigation, and receive its
rents, issues, and proﬁts, and apply
or dispose of them at the direction of

when it appears that such executor or administrator has
published a notice of his intention to apply therefore in
some newspaper in general circulation in the county, for
the period of four weeks prior to such application, and

that he is not in default in any matter connected with
the duties of his trust.

Every

legally exhibited against the estate of the testator or

county court a statement of all such claims as have been

presented, and whether the same have been allowed or

refuse to allow any claim or demand against the deceased,
after the same may have been exhibited to him in ac

may present his claim to the county court for allowance,
