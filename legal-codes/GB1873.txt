tention to confer such right shall expressly appear
by the instrument creating such estate. 
Me1�ger. 
( 4.) There shall not, after the commencement of this Act,
be any merger by operation of law only of any estate,

from whom the assignor would have been entitled to
receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall
be, and be deemed to have been, eft'ectual in law

fit, whether the person against whom such injunction
is sought is or is not in possession under any claim
of title or otherwise, or (if out of possession) does or
does not claim a right to do the act sought to be.
restrained under any colour of title; and whether the
estates claimed by both or by either of the parties
are legal or equitable.
