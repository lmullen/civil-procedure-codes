notice and including day of motion, ch. 114, J 12, these statutes.
§ S. Remedy by motion on certain bonds.] § 5. In the case of any
bond taken by an officer, or given by a sheriff or constable, and returned to or filed
in the office of the clerk of the county court, the circuit court, or county court of the
county, may, on motion of any person, give judgment for so much money as he is
entitled by virtue of such bond to recover by action.
Code, ch. 121, J 6, as amended and re-enacted by acts 1872-8, ch. 104. Amendment struck out recorder

§ 6. Remedy by motion on contracts.] § 6. Any person entitled to
recover money by action on any contract, may, on motion before any court which
would have jurisdiction in an action, otherwise than under the second section of the
one hundred and twenty-third*chapter, obtain judgment for such money after sixty
days' notice, which notice shall be returned to the clerk's office of such court forty
days before the motion is heard. A motion under this section, which is docketed
under the first section of chapter one hundred and thirty-one, *shall not be discontin
ued by reason of no order of continuance being entered in it from one day to
another, or from term to term.
Code, ch. 121 , { 6. 8ame ns \ 6, ch. 167, 0. Va.*Chs. 151, 157, of this work. As reported by revisors
this section rend : "Any person entitled to recover money by action on any contract, may, on motion before
any court which would have jurisdiction in an action, obtain judgment for such money after notice." Not
to take away the right to bring an action but to allow, when the claim to money is on a contract, the remedy
by motion instead of an action, Rep. Rev. C. Va. 832; 1 Call, 843. Notice must be returned forty days
before the commencement of the term and put upon the docket,13 Gratt. 658; 16 Gratt. 136; and judg
ment should conform to the notice, 15 Gratt. 172, although it was in 7 Leigh, 221, determined otherwise
that the motion should be made on the day designated in the notice or the record show a continuance, 1 H.
& M. 4, except under this section, 13 Gratt. 658. No pleading or issue necessary, 8 Rand. 654. and if no
appearance judgment is by default, 16 Gratt. 134. Bill of particulars can be required, ch. 85, \ 46, these
statutes.
§ 7. Judgment on motion.] § 7. A person entitled to obtain judgment
for money on motion, may, as to any, or the personal representatives of any person
liable for such money, move severally against each, or jointly against all, or jointly
against any intermediate number ; and when notice of his motion is not served on alt
those to whom it is directed, judgment may nevertheless be given against so many of
those liable as shall appear to have been served with the notice. Such motions may
be made from time to time until there is judgment against every person liable, or his
personal representative.*Defense to such motions may be made in the same manner
and to the same extent as in actions at law.
Code, ch. 121, \ 1. Same as J 7, ch. 167, 0. Va., except below the star. On a joint notice to nil the
obligors the plaintifff may take judgment against any one, 2 Call, 868. The judgment on motion is proper,
if no return to the execution, although it had been levied, 6 Call, 435. See 3 Call, 868, 521 ; 4 Id. 130 j 6
Id. 435; 21 Gratt. 263.
§ 8. Jury trial.] § 8. On a motion when an issue of fact is joined, and either
party desires it, or when in the opinion of the court it is proper, a jury shall be im
paneled, unless the case be one in which the recovery is limited to an amount not
greater than twenty dollars, exclusive of interest.
Code, ch. 121, J 8. Same ns J 8, ch. 167, C. Va. No formal issue necessary; the pleading may be ore
tenue, 8 Rand. 654. The court can determine the case without a jury, 18 Gratt. 846. See 1 Wash. 72 ; 1
Raud. 1 ; 8 Id. 654. The revisors framed this chapter for the avowed purpose of allowing the proceedings
by motion to be had in every case in which a party claimed money "on a contract ; " their object being to
introduce motions in the place of actions on all such claims. The legislature in their enactment excepted a
large class of cases which the revisors' report embraced, and required the excepted classes to be asserted as
theretofore by action, see $ 6, this ch. In harmony with this spirit the statute requires the noiiee to be
filed forty days before hearing the motion, which has been construed to mean forty days before the term, 1 3
Gratt. 658 ; 16 Giatt. 136 ; ch. 157, J 1, post. At the time this chapter was framed the doctrine that any
general notice which will apprise the defendant of the object of the motion, prevailed, 1 Call, 44, 355; 6
Call, 523 ; 4 Munf. 398 ; but it is suggested that the notice Upon which to base a motion whilst it should
not be as particular as a declaration, it should be more particular than the old general notices, 27 Gratt.

Before this statute actions were commenced by writ of capias ad respondendum, issuable only to the
sheriff of the county in which the action was brought, so that defendant could give bail. This being
abolished in 1849 (nothing left but the provisions in the attachment law, see ch. 6 vol. 1), and summons
substituted; the revisors reported this section without the exception contained in it, considering that the
principle which confined the process under a capias to the county where the defendant could get bail did
not apply to a summons, and thereforee could go from one county to another, Rep. Rev. C. V. 835. The
legislature inserted the exception, hence if cause of action arose in county of A, and defendant resides ia
county of B, and suit is brought in county of C, the defendant can only be served in county of C, and
then perhaps liable to plea in abatement, see 26 Gratt. 637. Service should conform to ch. 178, post, and

returned executed, an alias, or other proper process, may be issued, without waiting
(where the first process is returnable to a term) for the subsequent process to be
awarded at rules. And where, for want of a return of the first process against a
defendant, any subsequent process is issued, if the former was executed, the officer
shall not execute the latter ; but shall return the former, if it is in his possession, and
if he has it not, shall return the latter with an endorsement of the execution of the
former, and the proceedings thereupon shall be as if the first had been duly returned.

It was decided in Roote's Ex'r, v. Tompkins, 8 Gratt. 98, that J 4, ch. 123 of 1 R C. 1819, operated on
the estate or effects of the absent defendant, and the title which passed by virtue of an execution there

quence of this the revisora in reporting { 27, ch. 6 of these statutes, omitted the last clause of j 4, ch. 123,
1 R. C, as being nugatory, and substituted n provision for making the judgment conclusive. It would seem
thereforee that though the defendant in attachment cannot apply J 27, ch. 6, vol. 1, he can avail himself of
the above section which will not, however, disturb the possession of the attached effects in the hands of
third persons, yet justice may be done between the immediate parties. [Ed.]

ground of such defendant's residence in such county, the action or suit shall abate as

Of the Declaration.
§ 9. Form.] § 9. No action shall abate for want of form, where the declaration
sets forth sufficient matter of substance for the court to proceed upon the merits of
the case.
Code, ch. 125, \ 9. Same as J 11, ch. 171, C. Va. From 1 K. C. 611, \ 100. Acts immaterial alleptious, see \\ 32, 33, 34. Same as \ 100, ch. 128, 1 R. C. 1819. First statute jeofails in Va. 1789, cb. '28,
but by acts Oct. 1748, ch. 6 (5 Stat. Larg. 482), and Nov. 1753, eh. 1 (6 Stat. Larg. 339), all the English
statutes on the subject were adopted by general reference.
Under 1 Will, iv, ch. 70, \ 11, English judges in 1831, adopted forms of declarations for certain demands
for which, see 4 Bligh. Par. Cn. N. S. 585; 20 Eng. C. L. R. 324; 1 Chilly Pi. 724 ; Rob. Forms, 502;
intended to encourage conciseness in all cases, 1 Chitty Pi. 243. With the same view the revisorspropo-cd
that declarations muy be filed according to such forms when applicable, but regarding it superfluous it
was not adopted.
This section refers to declarations only ; section 29, pott, embraces all kinds of pleading except plena in
abatement, and provides that no defect or imperfection in pleading is fatal " whether it has iierelofore beea
deemed mispleading or insufficient pleading or not," and is a material extension of the statute, 16 Gran.

overruled, 6 Gratt. 131. Therefore declaration must Bhow that defendant is liable, 8 Rand. 300 ; and stats
the cause of action so that defense can be made, and plead it in bar to any other action, for the t>ame cause,

§ 10. Action of trespass.] § 10. In actions of trespass, general aver
ments that the defendant committed other wrongs, and that the acts charged were
done with force and arms against the peace, may be omitted ; and the plaintifff may
prove all that he could have done if such averments had been inserted in the declara
tion.

§ 11. Account to be filed.] § 11. In every action of assumpsit the plaintifff
shall file with his declaration an account stating distinctly the several items of his
claim, unless it be plainly described in the declaration.

for want of this account, see ch. 85, \ 46. The former law also provided that if it was not so plainly and
particularly described, as to give defendant full notice, no evidence admissible to prove. Before 1819 this
was not required. For its necessity, see 1 Call, 239 ; 2 Munf. 275 ; construction thereof, see Tidds. Pr. 684 ;
Phill. Ev. 145, 147. The law is the same as under act 1819, full notice of every claim and character
thereof is required, 1 Rob. Pr. 156 ; 4 Rand. 488 ; 9 Pet. 611, and if not given claim cannot be proved, 8
Gratt. 1. The account mentioned, is a bill of particulars to acquaint the defendant of plaintifff's demand,
and if plain enough to guard against surprise it is sufficient, Phill. on Ev. 147. Instance thereof, 4 Rand.

§ 13. Amended declaration or bill.] § 12. The plaintifff may of right
amend his declaration or bill at any time before the appearance of the defendant,*
or after such appearance if substantial justice will be promoted thereby. But if such
amendment be made after the appearance of the defendant, the court may impose
such terms upon the plaintifff as to a continuance of the cause, and the payment of
the costs of such continuance, as it may deem just.*
Supplemental Bill, and Bill of Revivor.] The plaintifff may also, at any time
after the appearance of the defendant, in the vacation of the court wherein the suit
is pending, file in the clerk's office, with the other papers in the cause, an amended

§ 13. Guardian ad litem.] § 13. The proceedings in a suit, wherein an
infant or insane person is a party, shall not be stayed because of such infancy or
insanity, but the court in which the suit is pending, or the clerk thereof at rules, may
appoint a guardian ad litem to any infant or insane defendant, whether such defend
ant shall have been served with process or not. The court may compel the person so
appointed to act, or appoint another in his stead ; but the person so appointed shall
not be liable for costs, and shall be allowed his reasonable charges, which the party
on whose motion he was appointed shall pay.

Matter of Abatement.
§ 14. Misnomer.] § 14. No plea in abatement for a misnomer shall be
allowed in any action ; but in a case wherein, but for this section, a misnomer would
have been pleadable in abatement, the declaration and summons may, on the motion
of either party, and on affidavit of the right name, be amended by inserting the same
therein.

§ 13. Defects in writ, etc.] § 15. In other cases, a defendant, on whom
the process summoning him to answer appears to have been served, shall not take
advantage of any defect in the writ or return, or any variance in the writ from the
declaration, unless the same be pleaded in abatement.* And in every such case, the
court may permit the plaintifff to amend the writ or declaration so as to correct the
variance, upon such terms as to it shall seem just.
Code, ch. 125, J 16. Same as | 18, ch. 171, C. Va., except below the star. From 1 B. C. 511, gg 101,
108. Plea in abatement, J 89, post. 1 Call, 55, 160. Formerly, on demurrer joined, court disregarded
defects in the writ return declaration or pleadings, and no judgment after verdict shall be stayed or reversed
for variance in the writ from the declaration, 1 It. C. ch. 128, J8 101, 108. Now these are causes for plea in
abatement only. Vuriance exists if writ is in assumpsit and declaration in covenant, 8 Leigh, 270; or
writ against four nnd decim ation against three defendant*, 4 Munf. 94 ; 10 Pet. 300; but not when one
uses initials the other the full names, or difference in claim for damages, 2 Gratt. 854; 15 Id. 62; 8 Id. 53S>.
To take advantage of variauce, crave oyer and plead in abatement, 2 Wash. 203 ; 1 Rob. Pr. 168 ; 1 Chin v

The variance is waived by appearance pleading or agreement, 8 H. & M. 309; 8 Rami. 840; 2 Munf. 297 ;

§ 16. Exceptions to jurisdiction.] § 16. Where the declaration or bill
shows on its face proper matter for the jurisdiction of the court, no exception for
■want of such jurisdiction shall be allowed, unless it be taken by plea in abatement;
and the plea shall not be received after the defendant has*pleaded in bar, or answered
to the declaration or bill, nor after a rule to plead, or a conditional judgment or
decree nisi.
Code, ch. 125, \ 16. Same as \ 19, ch. 171, C. Va., except that nt*it has the word " demurred." From
1 R. C. 214, J 86 ; p. 25fi, \ 52. This is according to Pollard v. Patterson's Adm'r., 3 17. & M. 67 ; 2 Rob.
Pr. 97; that if bill showed thnt matter was not proner for the court it could not take jurisdiction although
no plea in abatement filed, also 2 Leigh, 6. This refers to matter of abatement such as another tribunal
suspension or abatement of particular suit, 10 Gratt. 861 ; 19 Gratt. 485, and not where jurisdiction is
prohibited as when remedy is tit law in which case can object to jurisdiction at heating, Id. If face of

§ 17. Pica for non-joinder.] § 17. No plea in abatement, for the non
joinder of any person as a co-defendant, shall be allowed in any action, unless it be
stated in the plea that such person is a resident of this State, and unless the place o£
residence of such person be stated with convenient certainty in an affidavit verifying
the plea.
Code, ch. 125, J 17. Sameas J 20, ch. 171, C Vn. From 8 & 4 Will, ir, ch. 42, | 8. See 1 Chitty PI.
468 of 10 Ed., alter which this was framed. Where suit is brought end process served in county where
defendant does not reside nnd where cause of action did not arise, court lias no jurisdiction if defendant
resides in the State, 26 Gratt. 637 ; a question raised by plea in abatement filed at return day of writ, nnd
state where defendnut does reside, 2 Gratt. 202; but, see 27 Gratt. 259, 266, contra. Non-joinder is fatal
if done by plaiuliff's instructions, 6 Munf. 650; or if any of obligees omitted, 9 Gratt. 474.
§ 18. Issue against defendant.] § 18. If a defendant plead in abate
ment that any other persons ought to be jointly sued, and at the trial of an issue
joined on such plea, it appear that the action could not, by reason of chapter*ninetyeight, or chapter*one hundred and four, be maintained against such other persons, or
any of them, such issue shall be found against the defendant so pleading.
Code, ch. 125, 1 18. S-tme as J 21, ch. 171, C. Va. From 9 Geo. iv, ch. 14, J 2;*chs. 95 aud 119, these
Statutes. As to this, see 1 Chitty PI. 469, lOih edition. When it appears the action could not be main
tained against the person not joined on account of (lie Etatuteof frauds or statute of limitations, is^ue shall
be found in favor of the plaintifff, see 6 Munf. 660; 9 Gratt. 474. Infant partners should be joined in
action against the firm, 2 Rand. 478, and all the obligees, or sufficient excuse given, 9 Gratt. 474. Even
Statute of limitations not pleadable sometimes, 6 Call, 462.
§ 19. Amendment ; costs.]] § 19. After such plea in abatement, the
plaintifff, without proceeding to trial upon an issue thereon, may amend his declara
tion, and make the persons named in such plea as joint contractors, defendants in the
case with the original defendants, and cause process to be served upon the new defend
ants ; and, if it appear by the subsequent pleadings in the action, or at the trial
thereof, that all the original defendants are liable, but that one or more of the other
persons named in such plea are not liable, the plaintifff shall be entitled to judgment,
or to verdict and judgment, as the case may be, against the defendants who appear
liable ; and such as are not liable, shall have judgment, and recover costs as against the
plaintifff, who shall be allowed the same as costs against the defendants who so pleaded.

General Roles as to Pleas and Subsequent Pleadings.
§ 20. Number of pleas.] § 20. The defendant in any action or suit may
plead as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he shall think necessary,*
except that if he plead the plea of non est factum he shall not, without leave of
the court, be permitted to plead any other plea inconsistent therewith. To any special
plea, pleaded by a defendant, the plaintifff may plead as many replications as he may
deem necessary.
Code, ch. 125, { 20. Above'is { 23, ch. 171, C. Va. From 1 R. C. 610, J 88. " The plaintifff in re
plevin and the defendant in other actions may plead as many several matters, whether of law or of fact ai
he shall think necessary," 1 R. C. ch. 128, {88; 4 & 6 Ann. ch. 16 ; 22 Eng. C. L. 426. Construed to per
mit inconsistent pleas, 2 Munf. 101; 4 II. & M. 277 ; 4 Munf. 466 ; 6 Id. 1 ; plea and demurrer at same time
to same matter, 2 Munf. 618; 6 Munf. 7; 6 Call, 71 ; 2 Brock. 14; 7 Leigh, 402 ; auswer and demur, 7
Leigh, 402 ; 8 Leigh, 632 ; 3 Rand. 56, 448 ; but demurrer decided first, 2 Munf. 618 ; S Id. 7, which con
struction is still in force, so that plea in abatement nnd plea in bar, and demurrer is admissible, 16 Gnrtt.
488. This abrogates the English rule that defendant could not demur and plead or demur aud answer to the
same matter, 7 Leigh, 402. This Bectiou unlike nil former laws extends the double pleading to the plaiuuS,
and prohibits inconsistent pleas when non at/actum is pleaded, rendering 3 Rand. 448, and Lang v. Lewis,
1 Rand, obsolete. See 18 Gratt. 729.
§ 21. In abatement and in bar.] § 21. The defendant may plead in
abatement and in bar at the same time, but the issue on the plea in abatement shall be
first tried. And if such issue be found against the defendant, he may, nevertheless,
make any other defense he may have to the action.
Code. ch. 126, \ 21. Not in C. Vn. This grew out of previous section.
§ 22. Unnecessary allegations.] § 22. In a plea, replication, or subse
quent pleading, intended to be pleaded, in bar, or in maintenance of the action, it

shall not be necessary to use any allegation of actionem non, or precludi non, or
to the like effect, or any prayer of judgment. [Code, ch. 125, § 22-]
Same as \ 24, ch. 171, C. Va. From Rules Eng. Judges, 18S4; 25 Eng. C. L. R. 200 ; 17 Gratt. 230.

testation in any pleading.
Code, cb. 125, J 23. Same as } 25, ch. 171, C. Va. From same rules. 19 Gratt. 610.
§ 24. Concluding to the country.] § 24. All special traverses, or tra
verses with an inducement of affirmative matter, shall conclude to the country. But
this regulation shall not preclude the opposite party from pleading over to the induce
ment when the traverse is immaterial.
Code, ch. 125, \ 24. Same as J 26, ch. 171, C. Va. From lame rules. Plea filed plaintifff should demur,
take issue, or traverse the time wilh an inducement of affirmative matter. Au issue is simple denial of
the plea. Traverse alleges new matter or distinction inconsistent with plea and denies the statement of the
plea; the new matter is the inducement, the denial, the traverse, Gould. PI. ch. 7.
§ 25. As in case of similiter, etc.] § 25. When the plaintifff takes issue
on the defendant's pleading, or traverses the same, or demurs, so that the defendant
is not let in to allege any new matter, the plaintifff may*proceed as if there were a
similiter or joinder in demurrer.
Code, ch. 125, \ 25. *At this point C. Va. ch. 171, \ 27, has "without giving a rule to rejoin." From
same rules. This section intended to settle question in Nadenbousch v. McRae, Giim. 22S. Which decided
that a general replication does not constitute an issue unless so considered and intended by the parties.
Now when pleading has reached a point where defendant cannot allege new matter an issue is made, and
plaintifff can proceed, 20 Gratt. 344. The principle is if plea concludes to tiie county replication must also
do it, 20 Gratt. 344, this is the similiter or issue. Id. ; but if replication contains new mutter it must con
clude with verification and no issue is made until rejoinder filed, Id. ; but see 5 Leigh, 268 ; Giim. 338. The
omission of similiter, or joinder was under etat. jeofails cured after verdict, 1 Wash. 363 ; 4 Rand. 488;

Particularly as to Pleas and Demurrers.
§ 26. Commencement of plea.] § 26. No formal defense shall be
required in a plea ; it may commence as follows: " The defendant says that."
0ode,ch. 125, \ 26. Same as J 28, ch. 171, C. Va. From rules of Eng. Judges, 1834. See 20 Eng. C.

447. Certainty in plea, 2 Gratt. 863 ; 6 Id. 393. Replication to plea amendable, 7 Gratt. 885.
§ 27. Subsequent plea.] § 27. It shall not be necessary to state in a
second or other plea, that it is pleaded by leave of the court, or according to the
form of the statute, or to that effect.
Code, ch. 125, \ 27. Same as { 29, ch. 171,0. Va. From same rules.
§ 28. Demurrer and joinder.] § 28. The form of a demurrer or joinder
in demurrer shall be: " The defendant (or plaintifff) says that the declaration (or
plea, etc.) is not (or is) sufficient in law."
Code, ch. 125, j 28. Same as { 30, ch. 171, C. Va. From same rules. This is the form of a general
demurrer for want of substance, given in the books. Steph. PI. 45, 140; 1 Ch'uty PI. 667. The effect of
this and the next section is to abolish special demurrers. The demurrer now as under 27 Eliz. clt. 5, and 4
& 6 Ann. ch. 16, raises the question whether there is substance sufficient to sustain the action, 6 Gratt. 130,
354 ; 9 Gratt. 89 ; 1 Rob. Pr. 280; Gihn. 838, and to give judgment according to law and the right of the
cause, does not comprehend demurrers to pleas in abatement, 2 H. & M. 314 ; 2 Man. & Belw. 485 ; 6 Leigh,

§ 29. Defects to be disregarded.] § 29. On a demurrer (unless it be to
a plea in abatement) the court shall not regard any defect or imperfection in the
declaration or pleadings, whether it has heretofore been deemed mispleading or insuffi
cient pleading, or not, unless there be omitted something so essential to the action or
defense, that judgment, according to law and the very right of the cause cannot be

entered in the office in a case wherein there is no order for an inquiry of damages,
and every non-suit or dismission entered therein, shall, if not previously set aside,
become a final judgment, of the last day of the next term of the court, or the
fifteenth day thereof (whichever shall happen first), and the same shall be entered up
in court either during such term or after its adjournment, by the clerk, and in either
case shall have the same effect, by way of lien or otherwise, as other judgments
entered in the court during such term.*But no such judgment shall be so entered up
(except non-suits and dismissions) until the plaintifff, his agent or attorney, shall file
in the cause his affidavit, stating that he verily believes there is due from the defend
ant to the plaintifff, upon the demand in controversy in the suit, including principal
and interest, a sum certain, to be stated in the affidavit, after deducting all just
credits, payments, and set-off to which the defendant is entitled. Such judgment
shall be for the plaintifff for the amount so stated, with interest from the date of the
judgment, and such other judgment or order may be rendered and made therein as
may be proper. If such affidavit be not made, or the action be one in which an
order for an inquiry of damages has been entered, the plaintifff can only recover judg
ment upon proving his case. If the defendant has not appeared, and a jury be im
paneled in any such action, their oath shall be that they will well and truly find the
amount, if any, which the plaintifff is entitled to recover in the action, and a true
verdict render according to the evidence.

tempt, put in an answer which is adjudged insufficient, the plaintifff may go on with
the subsequent process of contempt, as if no answer had been filed ;*or, at the option
of the plaintifff, if the bill be verified, the court may thereupon render such decree in
the case as may be just.

§ SO. Hearing cause in equity.] § 50. A plaintifff in equity may, at or
after the rule day at which the bill is taken for confessed as to any defendant, or at
which his answer is filed, have the cause set for hearing as to such defendant ; and it
may be so set for hearing on the answer, or upon a general replication thereto, as the
plaintifff may prefer. If two months elapse after the answer of a defendant is filed,
without the case being so set, and without exceptions being filed to his answer, he may
have the case set for hearing as to himself.

fendants in the suit, that it would be improper to decide upon their interests separately.
And though there be such connection, a defendant as to whom the case has been set
for hearing, may have an order upon the plaintifff to use due diligence to mature the
cause for hearing as to the other defendants, and, unless it be so matured within such
time as the court may deem reasonable, shall be entitled to a hearing or dismission of
it as tO him. Code, ch. 125, J 61. Same as { 50, ch. 171, C. Va. From acts 1825,'6, ch. 15, { 13.

which is not sufficient in law to constitute a defense therein, the plaintifff may object
to the filing thereof on that ground, and the same shall be rejected. But if the court
overrule the objection and allow the plea to be filed, the plaintifff may take issue there
on without losing the benefit of the objection, and may, on an appeal from a judg
ment rendered in the case in favor of the defendant, avail himself of the error committed

count on a policy of insurance, whether the policy be under seal or not, may be in
effect as follows :
A. B. complains of C. D., who has been summoned to answer this : for that the
defendant, by virtue of the policy of insurance herewith filed (or a copy of which
is herewith filed), owes (here state the amount claimed under the policy), to the
plaintifff for loss in respect to the property (or subject) insured by said policy, caused

if the fact be so, the plaintifff may state in the declaration or count that the time or
place where the loss or death occurred is unknown to him, giving in general terma
such information as may be in his power in respect thereto.
Sufficiency.] Nothing contained in this act shall render insufficient in law any
declaration or count which would be sufficient if this had not been passed.
Acts 1877, oh. fi6, { 1. See W. R. Mut. F. Ins. Co. v. Sheets & Co. 26 Grait 854.
§ 62. Statements required.] § 2. If good cause therefore be shown or
appear, the court or judge in vacation may order the plaintifff to file a more particular
statement, in any respect, of the nature of his claim or the facts expected to be
proved at the trial, and may stay the action until a reasonable time after such order
is complied with ; and such statement must be made under the oath of the plaintifff,
his officer, agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect that the affiant believes the same
will be supported by evidence at the trial. But no such order shall be made if it
appear that there has been unreasonable delay on the part of the defendant in apply
ing therefore. [Id. § 2.]
§ 63. Same.] § 3. In like manner, if good cause therefore appear, and there
be no unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintifff in applying for such order, the
court or judge in vacation may order the defendant to file a more particular state
ment, in any respect, of the nature of his defense or the facts expected to be proved
at the trial, which statement shall be made under the oath of the defendant, his
officer, agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect that the affiant believes the same will be
supported by evidence at the trial. [Id. § 3.]
§ 64. What defendant may plead.] § 4. To any declaration or count
on a policy of insurance whether the same be in the form prescribed by this act or
not, and whether the action be covenant, debt or assumpsit, the defendant may plead
that he is not liable to the plaintifff as in said declaration is alleged. But if in any
action on a policy of insurance, the defense be that the action cannot be maintained
because of the failure to perform or comply with, or violation of any clause, condi
tion or warranty in, upon or annexed to the policy, or contained in or upon any paper
which is made by reference a part of the policy, the defendant must file a statement
in writing specifying, by reference thereto, or otherwise, the particular clause, condi
tion or warranty in respect to which such failure or violation is claimed to have
occurred, and such statement must be verified by the oath of the defendant, bis
officer, agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect that the affiant believes the matter of
defense therein stated will be supported by evidence at the trial. [Id. § 4.]
§ 65. Plaintiff* file statement in writing.] § 5. Upon the plea men
tioned in the preceding section, the plaintifff may join issue without other pleading.
But if the plaintifff intends to rely upon any matter in waiver, estoppel, or in confes
sion and avoidance of any matter which may have been stated by the defendant as
aforesaid, the plaintifff must file a statement in writing, specifying in general terms
the matter on which he intends so to rely ; and such statement must be verified by
the oath of the plaintifff, his agent or attorney-at-law, to the effect the affiant believes
the matter of reply therein stated will be supported by evidence at the trial. [Id. §5.]
§ 66. If either party fail to file statement.] § 6. If either party to
the action fail to file any statement required of him by this act or by the other party
pursuant to this act, or if the statement be adjudged insufficient in whole or in part,
the court, as justice may require, may grant further time for filing the same, or per
mit the statement filed to be amended, or may, at the trial, exclude the evidence
offered by the party in default as to any matter which he has so failed to state or has
insufficiently stated. But no statement which, in the particulars required by or under
this act to be stated or referred to therein, is sufficient to notify the adverse party in
effect of the nature of the claim or defense intended to be set up against him, shall
be adjudged insufficient. [Id. § 6.]
§ 67. Pending suits.] § 7. This act shall not affect any pending suit. [Id. §7.]

real property or of the title or the soundness of personal property, for the price or
value whereof he entered into the contract, as would entitle him, either to recover
damages at law from the plaintifff, or the person under whom the plaintifff claims, or
to relief in equity, in whole or in part, against the obligation of the contract; or if
the contract be by deed, alleging any such matter existing before its execution, or any
such mistake therein, or in the execution thereof, as would entitle him to such relief
in equity ; and in either case alleging the amount to which he is entitled by reason of
the matters contained in the plea. Every such plea shall be verified by affidavit.

This Section relates to equitable set-off, and must be presented by special plea under onth. The rule ex
cluding unliquidated damages does not apply if the damages arose out of the contract sued on, 26 Gratt.
283, but if suit is for unliquidated damages,a liquidated demand cannot be a set-off against it. Id. This
section does not extend to a case where the claim is for a specific execution of the contract and damages
for a breach of it, but to expenses incurred iu perfecting an unsound title. 13 Gratt. 744. The pleimust
show that the off-set is within the statute, and be verified by affidavit, 13 Gratt. 743. Must allege breach

warranty, 15 Gratt. 672. This doctrine illustrated in Benj. on Sales, 8"3. When consideration fails either
with or without fraud, it is good defense under the statute, 15 Gratt. 572. See 21 Gratt. 678.

§ 6. Relief in equity.] § 6. If a defendant, entitled to such plea as is
mentioned in the preceding section, shall not tender it, or though he tender it, if it
be rejected for not being offered in due time, he shall not be precluded from such
relief in equity as he would have been entitled to if the preceding section had not
been enacted. *If an issue in fact is joined on such plea and the same be found
against the defendant, he shall be barred of relief in equity upon the matters alleged
in the plea, unless upon such ground as would entitle a party to relief against a judg
ment in other cases. Every such issue in fact shall be upon a general replication
that the plea is not true ; and the plaintifff may give in evidence, on such issue, any
matter which could be given in evidence under a special replication, if such replication
were allowed.
Code, ch. 126, J 6. At star C.Vn. ch. 172, J 8, hns: " If any such plea be rejected by the courts as bad,
or adjudged insufficient on demurrer; or," from acta 18SO, '31, ch. 11, { 63. If defendant is prevented
from setting up off-sets, not growing out of the demand sued on, and has a remedy at law for their recov
ery, he cannot go into equity for relief, but muat resort to his action at law, 9 Gratt. 379 ; 4 Gratt. 267;
see 2 Stow Eq. Jur. J 1437.
§ 7. Bonds.] § 7. Nothing in this chapter shall impair or affect the obligation
of any bond or other deed deemed voluntary in law upon any party thereto, or his rep
resentatives.

§ 8. Plea to rest of demand.] § 8. If the defendant file a plea or account
of set-off which covers or applies to part of the plaintifff's demand, judgment may be
forthwith rendered for the part not controverted and the costs accrued until the filing
of the plea or account, and the case shall be proceeded with for the residue, as if the
part for which judgment was rendered had not been included therein. And if, in
addition to such plea or account, the defendant plead some other plea, going to the
whole or residue of the demand, the case shall not be continued as to the part not
controverted by plea or account of set-offs, unless the additional plea be also verified
by affidavit, or good cause be shown for such continuance.
Code, ch. 126, J 8. Same as { 8, ch. 172, C. Va. Originated with the revisors. This gives judgment
for uncontested residue when defense is to part of chum. If plea of set-off and a plea to whole action
filed, plaintifff requires defendant to state if to whole action, if not, judgment follows for uncontested part.
See Ren. Rev. C. Va.
§ 9. Defendant deemed a plaintifff.] § 9. A defendant who files a plea
or account under this chapter, shall be deemed to have brought an action against the
plaintifff (at the time of filing the same), for the matters mentioned in such plea or
account ; and the plaintifff shall not, after the plea or account is fil ed, dismiss his
case without the defendant's consent,fbut shall be entitled to every ground of defense
against the defendant's demand, of which he might have availed himself by special plea
or otherwise in any action brought against him upon the same demand.fOn the trial of
the issue in such case, the jury shall ascertain the amount to which the defendant is
entitled, and apply it as a set-off against the plaintifff's demand, and, if the said
amount be more than the plaintifff is entitled to, shall ascertain the amount of the
excess, including principal and interest. Judgment in such case shall be for the
defendant against the plaintifff for said excess, with interest from the date of the judg
ment till payment.
Code, ch. 126, J 9. Same as \ 9, ch. 172, C. Va. From 9 Geo. IV, ch. 14, { 4; acts 1830, '81, ch. 11,
\ 62. Same as reported by revisory except between dappers. This section wasadonted with the view that
if the defendant gives his consent he abandons his set-off or counterclaim, and cannot commence a new
action, but by reason of $ 19, ch. 119, these stat. revisors only desired to see this interpretation, Rep. Rev.
854. See 8 Pick. 521. Filing set-off by defendant i3 equivalent to commencing an action against plaintifff,
5 Gratt. 460; 18 Pick. 521. The words, "at lime of filing the same," abrogates Trimver v. Pollard, 5
Gratt. 460, a3 to statute of limitations ; making the time of plea pleaded or account of set-offs filed as the
date from which statute of limitations will cease to run, which can be insisted upon in the evidence, 5 Gratt.
471. Defendant not compelled to plead set-off; he may bring separate action, Babington on Set-off, 6 Law

be fairly stated therein), the judge, *or president and justices, or the greater part of
those acting,*shall sign, and it shall be a part of the record of the case.flf any
judge refuse to sign such bill of exceptions, he may be compelled to do so by the
supreme court of appeals, by mandamus ;*and the circuit court may in like manner
compel a county court, to sign a bill of exceptions. *A party may avail himself ol
any error appearing on the record, by which he is prejudiced, without excepting
thereto. § 2. This act shall be in force from its passage.
Code, ch. 131, J 9, as amended and re-enacted by acta 1872,'3, ch. '206—approved December 26, 1878.
Amendment within the stars. After the word "mandamus" the Code has "in which, case the bill of

2, eh. 133, of 1 R. C. from act 1814, applied to exceptions in criminal cases contained that part of above
section staling that bill should allege the truth and be made part of the record, under which it was decided
that act of 1789 did not apply to criminal cases, 2 Va. Cu. 264. See 13 Johns. 90; 2 Sumuer, 104. Prior

As reported by the revisora this section provided that non-suit or demurrer to the evidence not allowed
after argument commenced, and suggested that it was unjust after hours or days of argument to allow a
party to escape a verdict by demurring to the evidence. These views were not adopted, Rep. Rev. C. V. 874 ;
court cannot direct nun suit, may advise It; and if verdict against this advice, court can only award new

§ 14. Interest.] § 14. The jury, in any action founded on contract, may
allow interest on the principal due, or any part thereof,*and in all cases they shall
find the aggregate of the principal and interest due at the time of the trial, and judg
ment shall be entered thereon with interest from the date of the judgment.
Code, ch. 131, { 14. O. Va. ch. 177, J 14, permitted the jury to fix the period at which interest shall
commence or to bear interest from verdict, if not so fixed. From 1 R. C. 508, J 80; 8 & 4 Will, iv.ch. 42,

Above star is in 1 B. C. ch. 128, { 80, Rep. Rev. C. Va. and 1 14, ch. 177, C. Va. The 1 R. C. J 80, is
confined to contracts. Rep. Rev. is confined to contracts and trover, whilst Va. Code follows the star
with, "And in any action * * whether from contract or from tort, the jury may allow interest." Does
the language in above section below star extend to tort? 1 R. C. ch. 128, \ 80, provides : "And in all
actions («£ contractu) the jury shall ascertain the principal sum due," fix the date for interest to com
mence, *' and judgment shall be rendered accordingly." Under winch it was decided that it did not ex
tend to tort and interest not allowed on damages, 5 Leigh, 593; 9 Leigh, 484 ; and before July 1, I860,
no interest allowed in actions for tort though same amount might hare been allowed as damages, 13
Gratt. 227. In assumpsit if verdict more than amount claimed, can release excess, 4 Munf. 871 ; 8 Coweo,
893, where interest is fully considered. The jury is judge of amount of principal due and to bear in

854, 454 ; on judgment for rent, 26 Gratt. 65 ; 16 Id. 21.
§ 15. New trial.] § 15. In any civil case, the court before which a trial by
jury is had, may grant a new trial, unless*it be otherwise specially provided. fA
new trial may be granted, as well where the damages are too small as where they
are excessive. Not more than two new trials shall be granted to the same party in
the same cause.

New trial grantable.
1. When Verdict is against the law ; meaning when fact and law is involved in the issue and verdict is
Spain hi the law of the case on the facta proved, 6 Gratt. 712. When jury finds against the instructions, 1
Wash. 220; verdict for defendant on writ of inquiry, 9 Leigh. 18,30,422; when juror misunderstood
and misapplied the testimony, 4 Call, 84. When jury disregard the instructions, 2 Wash. 275. Founded
on opinion that majority of jury should govern, 1 Wash. 79. That jury adopted unlawful principle in esti
mating damages, 4 Call, 84 ; 6 Cowen, 63. To prove last two, the affidavit of jurors admissible, Id. ; but
not to prove that jury influenced by information given by juror in jury room, 1 H. & M. 886 ; 4 Biuney,
150, 155; 7 S. & R. 4 58 ; 8 Taunt. 26; 2 Johns. Ca. 818; 1 Nott & McCord, 163.
2. When the Terdiet is contrary to the evidence.—When issue involves matter of fact only and the
facts proved required a different verdict from that found by jury, 6 Gratt. 712. When verdict is erroneous
inference from laets proved, 12 Leigh, 147. When verdict against weight of evidence, 6 Gratt. 723, and a
plain deviation from right and justice, plainly against the evidence or without evidence, 2 Gratt. 594 ; 21
Gratt. 9; 3 Call, 319; 4 Mau. & Selw. 199; not because of conflict, or credibility of witnesses, 2 Munf.
478 ; 5 Leigh, 698 ; 6 Id. 230 ; nor because evidence circumstantial, 2 Rob. 772 ; but when inference from
evidence is unwarranted, 7 Leigh, 1 1 9, 3 10. The motion for tli is cause should rest on the evidence actually
given at the trial, and when facta fresh in recollection, 2 H. & M. 318; at same term, 4 Call, 279; 6 Munf.
457; 4 Teates, 5S8 ; but not on affidavits, 1 Wash. 157. If denied, opinion of court entitled to respect in
appellate court, 5 Leigh, 698 ; when the bill docs not set out the facts, but sets up the evidence which is
conflicting, the weight depending on the credit given to witnesses it will not be revised, 6 Gratt. 287 ; 2
Gratt. 594.
3. When the verdict is without evidence to support it.—This occurs when no proof, or not sufficient
proof, of the facts in issue, plainly insufficient to warrant the verdict, 6 Gratt. 723, but nut on ground that
evidence has been admitted which ought to have been rejected if exclusive of that evidence there is enough
to warrant the verdict, 4 Ad. & Ellis, 63; 6 Bing. 561; 16 Johns. 89 ; 3 Cowen, 612, 712 ; 4Chit.Pr. 32 ; Tate

4. Because Of after-discovered evidence, which must be discovered since the former trial, be such that
reasonable diligence could not huve been secured at former trial, must be material and new, not cumulative,
corroborative or collateral, and such as might produce on another trial an opposite result, 8 Gratt. 637 ;
27 Id. 313; 22 Gratt. 346; 6 Rand. 142; on affidavit of the persons or of others, of what the witnesses
will state, 8 Gratt. 267 ; 20 Id. 296 ; but not if evidence could have been secured by due diligence, 4 H. &
M. 869; 6 John. Ch. 479; 2 T. R. 113, nor for failure to summon witness, 2 Leigh, 474; 4 Call, 450;
Otherwise if summoned, 4 Call, 279 ; nor to enable party to impeach witness, 2 Salk. 653 ; 5 Johns. 248 ;
5 Leigh, 598 ; 8 Gratt. 637. Motion overruled, bill of exceptions should state affidavits, the facts proved,

AS. 366.
5. When the court has misdirected the jury.—Gilm. 41; Steph. PI. 95; 2 Salk. 649; 2 Tuck. Com.
805 ; 1 Rob. Pr. 375. Different opinion once existed, 1 Wash. 6. Misdirection is cause for new trial,
even if not excepted to, 27 Gratt. 78 ; but misdirection is no cause ifjustice has been done, 4 Leigh, 635 ;
2 T. R. 4 ; 2 Tuck. Coin. 802 ; 9 Eng. C. L. 490. Motion overruled, exception is to original misdirection,
•4 Call, 367 ; 1 Wash. 5, but if whole matter is in record, it is sufficient. 4 Call, 867.
6. Misconduct Of the jury,—As when jury left room and dispersed, 1 Leigh, 455, except by leave of
court, Id., but not if in company with sheriff, 8 Gratt. 637. By tossing up for verdict, 1 Leigh, 455.
Kendered under mistake, 1 Wash. 79 ; 6 Gratt. 219. Carry paper to their room, which was not in evi

£4, not to prove verdict influenced by information of one of jurors, 1 H. & M. 386 ; nor that agreed to be
majority verdict, 1 Rand. 39 ; nor that it is not what they intended, 1 Price Exch. 1 ; nor on juror's ndmiseion, 18 E. C. L. 331. Allowed to support, but not to impeach verdict, 4 Johns. 487; 14 Mass. 245; 6
Conn. 348, nor that verdict made under misapprehension, 6 Gratt. 287.
7. Misconduct of the judge.—Where judge corresponded with jury after they had retired from the bar,
Graham on New Trials, vol. 1, § 75, where he has commented on weight of testimony, 11 Gratt. 877, but
not for prejudicial remark if corrected, 12 Leigh, 466.
8. For fraud or surprise. —Thiscause was oneeexelusively applied to courts of chancery, and now applied
to conns of law, 1 Graham New Trials, J 161, and it occurs when fraud or surprise could not have been fore
seen or guarded against, 1 Call, 646; 4 Id. 279; 2H.&M.1S9, 408; 2 Munf. 253, 290: 4 H. & M. 491 ;
« Rand. 1 ; 2 Leigh, 334 ; 4 Call, 628 ; 6 Id. 279 ; 6 Munf. 418 ; 6 Id. 491 ; 2 Leigh, 157. When after
utmost diligence the party is taken bv surprise, suffers by mistake, or misled by suggestion of court, 1
Graham New Trials, J 161. When defendant taken sick on way to trial, 6 Call, 279. When judge leaves
beuch before motion could be made, 2 Gratt. 212; 4 Call, 279, but not from want of skill or mistake of
counsel or the parties, 2 Gratt. 866 ; nor when plaintifff failed to take non-snit, 1 Wash. 185 ; 4 Rand. 44;
nor for absence of witness, 4 Call, 274. Party must not be guilty of laches, 6 Rand. 134 ; 4 Gratt. 147.
Mistake by jury, 6 Gratt. 50. Pnctiee, 2 Gratt. 212. Testimony of one witness, 4 Munf. 479.
9. Because damages are too great or too small.—Before l K. C. ch. 128, J 96, no new trial in trespass
when damages loo su mil, 2 Va. Ca. 49. The principle from the authorities is, that in cases in which it is
material to lay damages, if verdict exceed that staled in declaration or writ, new trial will be granted unless
excess released, 17 Gratt. 427; 5 Munf. 494; 4 Id. 214; 6 Id. 271 ; 8Rand.62- 6 Call, 85 • 1 Rob. Pr.

§ 16. Judgment for money.] § 16. When there is a recovery on a bond,
conditioned for the payment of money, as well as in all cases where a judgment or
decree is rendered or made for the payment of money, it shall be for the aggregate of
principal and interest due at the date of the judgment or decree, with interest thereon
from that date, except in cases where it is otherwise provided.
Code.ch. 131, J 16. C. Va. ch. 1 77, 2 16, pave judgment for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged
by payment of principal and interest. From 1 E. C. 609, { 83 (and that from acts 1748 and 1792. and 4
ft 5 Anne, ch. 16), whicli is only a change in phraseology. The above suction ignores the penalty, and
requires judgment for the principal and interest. 4 W. Va. 693 ; 12W.Va. 144; 16 Grait. S3.
Prior to Stat. 4 & 5 Anne, and the Va. acts, lnw courts could only give judgment for the penalty, and to
obtain release, on payment of principal and interest, resort was had to equity. These statutes gave to law
courts this equitable jur isdiction, to discharge judgment for penalty on payment of principal and interest.
Bonafous v. Rybot, 3 Burr, 1370; 2 Barn. & Ores. 82; 8 Car. ft Payne, 12; 1 Fnnb. Eq. S98. The Va.
acts and C. Va. ch. 177, J 16, is similar to 4 & 5 Anne, ch. 16, and so construed, 6 Munf. 71, 77 ; 5 Id. 494;
1 Id. 175. But as the above section requires judgment for principal and interest due at the date of the
judgment, the Va. doctrines as to what is penally, when damages may be given in lieu of interest, etc., 1
Gratt. 310 ; 6 Rand. 188; 2 Leigh, 177 ; 4 Id. 201 ; 10 Id. 285 ; 2 T. R. 388 ; 6 Id. 303, seems to be in
applicable.
§ 17. Annuity bond.] § 17. In an action on an annuity bond, or a bond
for money payable by installments, where there are further payments of the annuity,
or further installments to become due after the commencement of the action, or in
any other action for a penalty for the non-performance of any condition, covenant,
or agreement, the plaintifff may assign as many breaches as he thinks fit. If there be
judgment for the plaintifff on a demurrer, or by confession, or by default or nil dicit,
he may so assign after such judgment. The jury empaneled in any such action, shall
ascertain the damages sustained, or the sum due, by reason of the breaches assigned,
including interest thereon to the date of the verdict ; and judgment shall be entered for
what is so ascertained, provided, that if the action be on such annuity bond, or a bond
for money, payable by installments, such judgment shall also be for such further sums as
may be afterwards assessed, or be found due upon a scire facias, assigning a further
breach. Such scire facias may be sued out from time to time, by any person in
jured, against the defendant, or his personal representative, and for what may be
assessed or found due upon the new breach or breaches assigned, execution may be
awarded.

held that plaintifff must assign, 5 T. R. 636. Breach of the condition, 4 Munf. 494, and damages sought to be
recovered, 8 Munf. 230; 4 Rand. 317. It will be error if judgment rendered without assignment of breaches,

necessary to constitute a breach, 4 Rand. 158. Assigning breaches of condition in constable's bond, 9 Gratt.

Bond for payment Of a Sum by installments is within this statute, and after judgment for one install
ment scire facial must issue to recover any subsequent installment, 3 Munf. 257 ; 6 East. 550; 2 Burr,
820, but bond with penalty, for payment of money on certain day and interest half yearly, with a stipula
tion that on default of paving interest the whole sum would be due, is not within the statute, SO C. L. R.
283 ; 6 Barn, ft Adolph. 40 ; 5 Meeson, 495; 2 B. & A. 39.

except where it is otherwise provided by law, shall bear interest from the date thereof,
whether it be so stated in the judgment or decree, or not.

principal paid. Fi ona 1 R. C. 508. { 80, p 208, \ 58.
The stat. 1 R.O. eh, 128, { 80, and \ 18, ch. 177, C. Va., is limited to actions founded on contract and
provided for interest on the principal sum recovered until such principal paid which was framed to ac
cord with. Smith r. Bond, 10 Bing. 125 ; 25 E. C. L. 56, whilst above section extends to every judgment or
decree which shall bear interest from date thereof, hence, 5 Leigh, 69S ; 9 Leigh, 484, seem inapplicable.

any person as the personal representative of a decedent, or committee of a convict or
an insane person, for a debt due from such decedent, convict, or insane person, may,
without taking an account of the transactions of such representative or committee, be

son, in, or which shall come to, the hands of the representative or committee to be ad
ministered. When the court enters of record that if he had prudently discharged his
duty, the suit or motion would not have been brought or made, the judgment or de
cree, so far as it is for costs, shall be entered, to be paid out of his own estate.

alone or in conjunction with any surviving trustee, as the caso may require ;Jand in
any case, when a trustee, or where there is more than one, all the trustees in any deed
of trust, shall have died or removed beyond the limits of the State, or shall decline to
accept the trust, or refuse to act, any person interested in the execution of the deed
may apply by motion to the circuit court of any county in which such deed is recorded,
which may appoint a trustee or trustees in the place of the trustee or trustees named
therein ; and the trustee or trustees so appointed and accepting the same shall be sub

said deed ; provided the grantorfin said deed, his heirs or personal representatives,
the creditor, or surety, or other persons interested to be secured thereby, or their per

The court will appoint a trustee and require bond when the trustee under the will has died, 2 H. 4 M.

the land when trustee died pending an injunction by the debtor.
§ 6. Personal representative or trustee.] § 6. The personal repre
sentative of a cole or surviving trustee, shall execute the trust, or so much thereof as
remained unexecuted at the death of such trustee (whether the trust subject be real or

§ 7. Rights of infants.] § 7. It shall not be necessary to insert in any de
cree or order a provision allowing an infant to show cause against it within a cer
tain time after he attains the age of twenty-one years. But in any case in which,
but for this section, such provision would have been proper, the infant may, within
six months after attaining the age of twenty-one years, show such cause in like man
ner as if the decree or order contained such provision. This right of an infant shall
not be affected by the fourth section.

Code, ch. 132, J 7. Same as J 7, ch. 178, C. Va. From 1 R. C. 204, g 41.
The right of an infant to show cause against a decree after he arrives at age is limited to cau^e existing
at the rendition of the decree, and not such as arose afterwards. The question is, can any cause be shown
■why the decree at the time it was rendered was not a legal and binding one? Walker v. Puge, 21 Gratt.
636. Nor will the decree be set aside for irregularity if the evidence shows that the sale was necessary,
fairly made, and for a full price, 12 Gratt. 479; and see 1 1 Grait. 99; 14 Id. 102; nor where the decree is

§ 8. Right of purchaser not affected by reversal.] § 8. If a sale
of property be made under a decree or order of a court,*and such sale be confirmed,
though such decree or order be afterwards reversed or set aside, the title of the pur
chaser at such sale shall not be affected thereby ; but there may be restitution of the
proceeds of sale to those entitled. [Code, ch. 132, § 8.]

This section designed to avoid Cocke v. Gilpin, 1 Rob. 20, where it was held that every decree for pale

and of which he knows nothing. Rep. Rev. C. Vi. 877. This section do>s not refer to the order of con

the purchaser must ascertain whether the title is perfect, and if title defective he should present bis o jections before sale confirmed. 2 Gratt. 198 ; 6 Id. 60 ; 9 Id. 358 ; 4 Gill. & J. 479 ; 3 Har. & McH. 440; 9

This section substitutes a motion for the writ of error coram nobis, and whatever errors were corrected by
that writ are now corrected by motion. That writ was used to reverse a judgment for some error of fact;
that the facts stated are false, or that there is a fact neither affirmed nor denied on the record that makes
the judgment erroneous, 2 Tiiid Pr. 1186; such as infant defendant by attorney instead of by guardian,
suit against person under disability, or judgment against person after his death, 2 Tidd Pr. 1191 ; 2 Rand.
174; Steph. PI. 118; 6 B. & A. 418; or defect in the process, or some misprision of the clerk; in short,

to be corrected on motion applies to a proceeding by motion as well as by action, 6 Baud. 646. If there ia

§ 3. Errors insufficient to reverse.] § 3. No judgment or decree
shall be stayed or reversed for the appearance of either party, being under the age of
twenty-one years, by attorney, if the verdict (where there is one), or the judgment
or decree, be for him and not to his prejudice ; or for want of warrant of attorney ;
or for the want of a similiter, or any misjoining of issue ; or for any informality in
the entry of the judgment or decree by the clerk ; or for the omission of the name of
any juror ; or because it may not appear that the verdict was rendered by the num
ber of jurors required by law ; or for any defect, imperfection, or omission in the
pleadings, which could not be regarded on demurrer ; or for any other defect, imper
fection, or omission, which might have been taken advantage of on a demurrer or
answer, but was not so taken advantage of.

See ch. 158, { 29, ante.
The first statute of jeofails was passed in 1789, ch. 28, though prior to this time all the English statutes
on this subject were adopted by general reference by acta 1748, ch. 6, and 1753, ch. 1. The English stat
utes are, 82 Hen. viii, ch. 80; 18 Eliz. ch. 14; 21 Jac. i, ch. 13; 16 & 17 Car. 2, ch. 8 j 4 & 5 Aune, ch.
16; 5 Geo. i, ch. 13. Act 1789 was revised in 1819, and[as to curing defects after verdict formed, { 103,
eh. 128, 1 R. C, which in brief provided that no judgment after verdict shall be stayed or reversed for
any defect or variance in the writ; any mispleading, insufficient pleading, discontinuance, misjoining of

issue, lack of warrant of attorney, appearance of infant (when for bis benefit); failure to allege deed or
letters testamentary, vi et armis ; for misnomer ; for mistake in sum, quantity, day, month, or year ; verifi
cation of pleading, iirerment, recital, jurisdiction of court, ownership in property, in form of action or
for any defect whatsoever in the declaration or pleading whether of form or substance ; or informality in
entering judgment; nor shall judgment by nil dicit or non sum informahct be reversed for such omission
or fault. The revisal of 1819 inserted, "No judgment after verdict shall be stayed or reversed • * •
for any defect in the declaration or pleading, whether of form or substance, which might have been taken
advantage of by demurrer, but was not so taken advantage of." This was deemed sufficiently comprehen
sive to embrace any conceivable case and destroy at once all questions on the forms of action after verdict,
2 Tuck. Com. 816.
The revision of 1819 was enlarged by amendment in 1838 and 1839. Parts of J 103, ch. 128, 1 R. C.
1819, applicable to pleadings were carried into ch. 125 of the code (ch. 1S3, ante ). It can, thereforee, be
seen that the above section covers, by general terms, the particular instances cited in the former law, Rep.
Bev. 883, hence, adjudications under the former law apply to the present, except Jenkins v. Hunt, 2 Rand.
446, abrogated by ch. 153, $ 52, ante, see 9 Leigh, 30.
Tie principle at common law and under the statute is that the statement of a defective, or omission to
state any, title or cause of action, is not cured, Doug. 658; 1 Saund. 228; 4 Rand. 846. If defective he
ought not, and if no cause, he cannot recover, but if good title or cause of action is stated defectively, the
verdict rectifies the error, % Tuck. Com. 316 ; Doug. 683. Where the gist of the action is not stated at all
the defect is not cured, but when the gist is stated, but stated imperfectly, it is cured, 2 Wash. 187; 1
Call, 83, 250 ; 2 Wash. 210; 8 Munf. 270; 2 Tuck. Com. 813. When deciaration sets forth no cause of
action, or plea no defense, the statute does not apply, but does apply where portion of the matter is appro
priate, 11 Gratt. 202.
Misjoinder Of issue fairly tried cannot be excepted to, 2 Wash. 1 ; nor when jury sworn to try the issue
when there are two issues joined, 7 Leigh, 68; 3 Call, 19; 4 Munf. 60; 6 Rand. 629; nor when no re
joinder to the replication, 4 Rand. 488; 1 Wash. 155; 3 Munf. 430; 8 Munf. 314; 4 Munf. 444 ; nor when
defendant fails to plead de novo after declaration amended, 7 Leigh, 147 ; 2 Call, 22 ; 8 Rand. 448 ; nor when
record shows issue joined, 4 (Rand. 161, 488. But the verdict does not cure the want of an issue, there
must bean issue, 20 Gratt. 344; 1 Wash. 155; Gilm. 228; 2 H. & M. 268; 8 Munf. 814; 4 Id. 430; 1
Baud. 161. The statute cures misjoinder of issue; informal joining of issue, but not when there is no
issue made up, Id., nor if no issue bad been joined, 10 Gratt. 251; 9 Leigh, 422; 4 Rand. 161, nor an issue
on immaterial fact, 1 Chitty, 631; 2 Tuck. Com. 314.
The similiter is adding, "and the plaintifff doth likewise," in making up the issue to plea of general
issue, being matter of form is cured after verdict, I Wash. 863; 4 Rand. 488, and in like manner non
joinder in demurrer is cured after judgmentjGihn. 838; 2 Wash. 363.
Statute of jeofails applies when verdict given without exception, not when given tinder misdirection, 6
Band. 560. Applies to set-off, 6 Gratt. 804, and non-joinder in special replication, 20 Gratt. 844. To aver
ment "wrongfully and without good cause," instead of maliciously and without probable cause, 15 Gratt. 881;
failure to state ownership, 4 Rand. 846. It permits error in declarations to be amended by the writ, 8 U.
4 M. 268, 602, but not when defendant appeared and pleaded without taking oyer of the writ, 4 H. & M.
310. Writ can rectify the declaration as to sums, dates, names, etc., 4 H. & M. 310. Misnomer is cured
after verdict, 10 Gratt. 352, not when action died with plaintifff, 11 Gratt. 202. Statute does not apply
when right to sue is in another, 12 Leigh, 204, nor to judgments by default, 4 Leigh, 412, nor when process
not served, 21 Gratt. 285, but does when defendant appears, 2 Rand. 446; 19 Gratt. 1 ; 21 Gratt. 285.

answer, where the defendant has taken depositions as if there had been a replication ;
nor shall decree be reversed at the instance of a party who has taken depositions, for

record, or in the vacation, by a writing signed by him, attested by the clerk, and filed
among the papers of the cause, release a part of the amount of his judgment or
decree ; and such release shall have the effect of an amendment, and make the judg
ment or decree operate only for what is not released. Every motion under this
chapter shall be after reasonable notice to the opposite party, his agent, or attorney,

allows judgments by default, on motion or on an action, to be reversed for errors of law as well as for
errors of fact, 16 Gratt. 135; 5 Rand. 546; 21 Gnat. 109. The latter allows judgment, where there has
been an appearance, to be corrected as to mistake.", etc., when there ia something in the record br which
the correction may safely be made, Id. To the former the statute of jeofails does not apply, 8 Leiph, 270;
4 Rand. 413; and decree by default set aside at subsequent term when bill of review or bill to impeach

The latter clause of the section is enlargement of 1 R. C. ch. 128, \ 108(from 4 Geo. iv, ch. 15), which
provided for the correction of mistakes, miscalculations, or misrecitals of any sum or name in tiie judg
ment, by the verdict, or any writing in the record; and the courts held that it only applied to clerical
errors, such as mistakes, miscalculations', or misrecitals which maybe safelv amended by other parts of

for which a judgment or decree is liable to be reversed or amended, on motion as
aforesaid, by the court which rendered it, or the judge thereof, until such motion be
made and overruled in whole or in part. And when an appellate court hears a case
wherein an appeal, writ of error, or supersedeas has been allowed, if it appear that,
either before or since the same was allowed, the judgment or decree has been so
amended, the appellate court shall affirm the judgment or decree, unless there be
other error ; and if it appear that the amendment ought to be and has not been made,
the appellate court may make such amendment, and affirm in like manner the judg
ment or decree, unless there be other error.
Code, ch. 134, { 6. Same as J 6, ch. 181, C. Va. To correct the errors mentioned in this chapter, no
appeal will lie until a motion has been made to reverse or correct the judgment in the court which ren

mere clerical error which might have been corrected in court below, or by judge iu vacation, but will
amend and affirm the judgment if no other error, 9 Gratt. 64 ; as the omission of court below to decree pay

controversy is the rule when bill dismissed, 6 Munf. 641 ; also when title to personalty is in question, 8
Band. 448; 9 Wheat. 627; 7 Leigh, 331. Damages in affirmauce not to be included, 2 Munf. 642. The
rule would seem to be jurisdiction depends on amount in dispute as it stands on writ of error when defend
ant is appellant, but when plaintifff is appellant the amount claimed by plaintifff governs, 16 Pet. 234 ; 6 Id.

that sum.

Va. ch. 186, J 9, followed star with provision that if rents and profits ofthe real estate subject to the lien will
not satisfy the judgment in five years the court may decree the estate to be sold and proceeds applied to
discharge of judgment. It has always been the practice for equity to give relief to judgment creditor
when debtor has subsequent to judgment conveyed his land away, 2 Gratt. 44; 4 Leigh, 429; 10 Leigh,
894 ; 4 Pet. 124, or charge the equitable estate of his debtor inlands which were mortgaged or incum
bered previous to the judgment, 2 Leigh, 281. Whether decree had been revived or not, or execution ever

count for value thereof, 6 Gratt. 84.

Judgment Liens.
§ 9. Lien as between alienees of different parts.] § 9. Where the
real estate liable to the lien of a judgment is more than sufficient to satisfy the same,
and it, or any part of it, has been aliened, as between the alienees for value, that
■which was aliened last shall, in equity, be first liable, and so on with other successive
alienations until the whole judgment is satisfied. And as between alienees who are
volunteers under such judgment debtor, the same rule as to the order of liability
shall prevail. But any part of such real estate retained by the debtor himself shall
be first liable to the satisfaction of the judgment.
G>de,ch. 1S9, \ 9. Same as \ 10, ch. 186, C. Va. This section was drawn to settle the law in favor of
McClung v. Beirne, 10 Leigh, 394, that where there were successive alienations of land, that which was
aliened last shall inequity be first liable; following Conrad v. Harrison, 3 Leigh, 632, although that applied
to a mortgage, and expressly overruling Beverly T. Brooke, 2 Leigh, 425, which decided that all the alienees
should contribute pro rata. See Rep. Rev. C. V. 918. Under this section in all cases the land last Bold by
the debtoris to be first applied to the satisfaction of the judgment, 4 Gratt. 81, and if judgment creditor
■wnived or lost his right to subject the land first liable he can only resort to land next liable for any balance
after crediting the value of land first liable, 8 Gratt. 180. Should bill pray for ratable contribuiion court
cm subject last land sold, 10 Gratt. 612 ; but that which debtor retains is always first liable, 6 Gratt 84;
JO Gratt. 164.
§ 10. Creditors share ratably.] § 10. Where two or more judgments are
rendered against the same person, and the lien thereof on his real estate commences
on the same day, the creditors having such judgments shall be entitled to satisfaction
out of said real estate ratably.
Code, ch. 139, \ 10. Same as § 11, ch. 186, C. Va.
§ 11. Limitation of proceedings to enforce judgments.] § 11.
On a judgment, execution may be issued within two years after the date thereof, or
if none be so issued, the court in which the judgment was rendered may thereafter,
and within ten years from the date of the judgment, upon ten days' notice to the
party against whom the same is, order an execution to be issued thereon, for such
sum as remains unpaid. Where execution issues within two years as aforesaid, other
executions may be issued on such judgment without notice, within ten years from the
return day of the last execution issued thereon on which there is ho return by an
officer, or which has been returned unsatisfied. And an action or scirefacias may
be brought upon a judgment on which no execution issued within the said two years,
or where there has been a change of parties by death or otherwise, at any time within
ten years next after the date of the judgment. But if such action or scire facias
be against a personal representative of a decedent, it must be brought within five
years from the qualification of such representative. Provided, that an action or
■scirefacias may be brought upon a judgment heretofore rendered against a city, or
town, or against the trustees or council of any city or town, by the plaintifff, or by
any person interested in such judgment, whether by assignment or otherwise, at any
time within twenty years from the date of such judgment, whether execution has been
issued thereon or not.
Code, ch. 139, J 11. C. Va. ch. 186, J 12, provided execution to issue within one year and scire facias
•or action brought within ten years after judgment. If execution issues within one year, others may issue,
©r Mci. fa. or action within ten years from return day when no return and 20 years when return made, except
aei.fa. or action against personal representative within five years. From 1 K. C. 489, 3 6 ; p. 492, j 17.
Under 1 E.C. ch. 128, {$ 6, 17, which C. Va. ch. 186, J 12, is a substantial transcript, it was held there
was no limitation on action of debt or scire facias upon a judgment except where no execution taken out
and except in cases of executors and administrators on a judgment against their testator or intestate. In
all other cases these remedies were left as at common law where after 20 years the presumption of payment
arose, 3 Rand. 490; Tidd Pr. 1004; 2 Wile. 82; 2Serg.it Raw. 142. If execution issued and duly returned
sei.fa. might issue at any time, 6 Munf. 32. The section was prospective, 8 H. & M. 237; 4 Munf. 104,
189; nor does it bar motion on forthcoming bonds, 4 Leigh, 303, and the set. fa. must be sued out and
prosecuted with effect, as to representatives, 1 Rand. 486. The issue of execution after two years is not
Toid but voidable, 10 Gratt. 278. Ten years from return day on which there is no return, 4 Leigh, 338 ; 1
Bob. 691.
Scire facias to revive judgment declaration or rule to plead not necessary. If writ returnable to rules
and defendant makes default, execution should be awarded, 7 Gratt. 202.
Personal representatives.—Judgment against testator must be revived against personal representative
■withiu five years after qualification, 1 Rind. 436, on scirefacias prosecuted to effect, Id. Cannot reply to
plea of statute, that defendant promised to pay, 4 Munf. 104. Statute begins to run from qualification of
rightful administrator, 10 Leigh, 93, and decree final, 10 Leigh, 687. After five years the statute is bar
to debt or scire facias, 11 Leigh, 2. Statute does not apply to judgment quanta acciderint, 1 Gratt. 426 j

Prohibition.

CHAPTER 164.—(Ch. 110 op Code)—Prohibition.
Of the Writ of Prohibition.
Section.—1. Application for writ ; pleading; damages and costs.
1. It shall not be necessary to file a suggestion on any application for a writ of
-prohibition, but the same may be applied for on affidavits only ; and in case the party
applying be directed to declare in prohibition, before writ issued, the declaration shall
be expressed to be on behalf of such party only, and not on the behalf of the party and
cf the State, and shall contain and set forth, in a concise manner, so much only of
the proceeding as may be necessary to show the ground of the application, without
alleging the delivery of a writ or any contempt, and shall conclude by praying that a
writ of prohibition may issue ; to which declaration the defendant may demur, or
plead such matters, by way of traverse, or otherwise, as may be proper to show that
the writ ought not to issue, and conclude by praying that 6uch writ may not issue ;
and judgment shall be given that the writ of prohibition do or do not issue, as justice
may require ; and the party in whose favor such judgment is given, whether on ver
dict or otherwise, shall recover his costs ; and in case a verdict shall be given for the
plaintifff, the jury may assess damages, for which judgment shall also be given, but
such assessment shall not be necessary to entitle the plaintifff to costs.
Code, ch. 110. Same aa ch. 155, C. Vn. From 1 Will. iv. oh. 21, J 1. Supreme court of appeals has
original and appellate jurisdiction in prohibition, const, art. 8, 2 3, and ch. 87, vol. 1, these statutes. Circuit

Prohibition >s » writ issued by superior court, directed to judge and parties of a suit in an inferior court,
commanding them to cease from prosecution of the same, upon suggestion that the cause originally, or
fome Collateral matter arising therein, does not belong to that jurisdiction, 8 Bl. Com. 112; Vin. ab. h. t.
B;>c. ab. h. t. The writ may also issue, when, having jurisdiction, the court has attempted to proceed by
rules different from those which ought to be observed, Bull, N. P. 219, or when, by the exercise of itsjur
isdiction, the toferior court would defeat a legal right, 2 Chit. Pr. 856. The writ was framed as early as
8 E iw. 1. Its purpose was to preserve the rights of the Kings Crown and the courts, and ease and quiet of
subjects and keep courts in their regular channel, 6 Rand. 637. It issues to inferior courts of common law
or to justices of the peace if tliey hold plea of a.iy matter beyond their jurisdiction, 1 Va. Ca. 158; 2 Va. Ca.
42, 1 Rub. Pr. 650. To restrain a judge from exceeding his jurisdiction, not to correct an erroneous judg.
roent in a case in which he hasjurisdiction, 20 Gratt. 10,496; to prevent failure of justice, 27 Gratt. 888;
and for superior courts to superintend inferior courts, 12 Gratt. 23; distinct from and independent of,
though collateral to, the proceedings sought to be prohibited, 12 Gratt. 17, 25, and the fact that error and
supersedeas would lie, did not show that prohibition would not also lie.for the remedies may be concurrent,
20* Gratt. 496, 484. To prevent proceedings for costs when illegal, 16 Gratt. 270. For the nature of the
writ and method of proceeding under it, see 8 Bl. Com. 1 12; 8 Bnc. Ab. 206; 1 Corny. Dig. 135; 2 H. Bl.
433; 6 East. 845; 1 Sattnd. 136; 4 Pike, 637; 6 Dana, 18; 1 Hob. Form. 847. The ground of the appli
cation issetforth in affidavit; if ground insufficient, court will atonce deny it. If grounds sufficient, a ruler
is made on adverse party to show cause why the writ should not bo issued. The execution of the rule on
thej-idge and party wililiave the effect of a prohibition gitousgne, or until the discharge of the rule.
Upon return of the rule, the court or judge will make it absolute or discharge it, and in the former case may
direct the applicant to declare in prouibition before writ issues, and ought to do so if the defendant require
it, which declaration concludes with prayer for the writ. To this the defendant may demur or plead such
matter as may be proper to show that the writ ought not to issue and conclude by praying that such writ
may not issue. Judgment shall be given that the writ do or do not issue, as justice may require and party
prevailing recovers costs. The issue being made up as in other cases, it is referred to a jury, and if they
find for the plaintifff they may assess damages for which judgment shall also be given, 12 Gratt. 17, 26; 22
