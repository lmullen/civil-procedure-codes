AN ACT to amend an act entitled an act organizing Circuit Courts, and denning
their powers and duties.
[APPROVED FEBRUARY 15, 1838.]
'Whereas, it often happens that reasons exist to make it a mat
ter of delicacy for a president judge of a circuit to preside
on the triaL of a particular cause, although he may not be le
gally disqualified; and whereas, it is desirable that a presi
dent judge of a circuit should not be subjected to the odi• um arising from a resistance of temporary popular excite
ment, which may sometimes become his duty; and whereas,
it is desirable to avoid the transfer of chancery cases to a
neighboring circuit, or to the supreme court, for the cause of
the interest or prejudice of a circuit judge; and w'hereas,
• the president judge is frequently of council for parties in
causes which afterwards come up for trial before him; and
whereas, >it is proper that a general system of practice should
prevail in the circuit courts throughout the state, which may
be effected by the means pointed out herein; thereforee,
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
Indiana, That any president judge of a circuit in this state
s]lan \>e competent to preside in and hold anv circuit court
r ' r » J
within any county ol this state, the president judge of the cir
cuit to which such county may belong being absent; and said
president judge so holding such court may continue the session
thereof, during any entire term, or during the progress of any
one trial or for any less time-.

tion of said judgment; and it shall not be lawful for the supreme court, or any judge thereof, to award a second writ of

in case af appeals; or that bond be given in like manner, in the
office of the clerk of the court below, subject to such regula
tions and conditions, as the supreme court or any judge thereof
may prescribe and direct. Writs of error shall be issued as a
matter of right, on demand of any person applying for the
same, and the clerk of the supreme court, at the time of issu-s
ing a writ of error, shall issue a summons, directed to the she
riff of the county in which such defendant in error shall reside,
requiring him to summon said defendant, to appear on the first.
day of the next term of the said court, to answer such error or
errors. And if the summons shall appear, by the return of
the sheriff or other officer, to have been served ten days before

defendant or defendants, is or are not an inhabitant or inha
tants of this state, the said court may order, that notice of the
pendency of such writ of error, be published in some one of
*
public newspapers; for three weeks successively; after whicb
same shall be jproceeded upon, in all respects, as if process
had been returned executed.

,ecoru m lne su[t or aclion named, and sealed with the ju
seal of said court, it shall be lawful for such plaintifff, to
assign upon the said transcript, all the errors upon which he
intends to rely, in order to reverse the said judgment or decree,
and file the same with the clerk of the supreme court, who
shall receive the same and endorse upon it when filed; and in
such case it shall not be necessary for said clerk to issue a writ
of error to the court below, but he shall issue a summons to
the defendant or defendants in error, in the same manner, as if
a writ of error had issued, and the supreme court shall proceed
in all respects to determine the same accordingly. ' Sec. 21. The plaintifff,-except in cases of wills, shall assign
erroiS upon matters of law only, arising upon the face of
^ proceedings. In cases of wills, the plaintifff in error may
assign errors upon matters of fact, as well as upon matters of
law, to be determined by the court. If the judgment or decree
ke an<;rmej jn tne whole, the appellant shall pay to the appel
lee, a sum not exceeding ten per centum, at the discretion of the
eeurt on the sum due thereby, besides the costs on the original
suit and appeal. If the judgment or decree be reversed in the
whole, the appellee shall pay to the appellant such costs as the
court in their discretion shall award. If the judgment or de
cree Joe reversed in part, and affirmed in part, the costs of the
original suit and appeal, may be apportioned between the appellant and appellee, in the discretion of the court. In case of
partial reversal, the supreme court shall give such judgment
or decree, as the inferior court ought to have given. On appeals
and writs of error, it shall .be lawful for the supreme court
l0 issue execution, or remand the cause to their inferior court,
■ j .i . - i 'l .u . .l
in order that an execution may be there issued or that other
proceedings may be had thereon. When any judgment or decree shall be reversed on account of any error, which shall or
may nave laken place in the progress of the cause, in the court
below, the supreme court shall not reverse the proceedings any
further than to include the first error which shall have been
committed; and the cause shall be remanded to the court from
whence it came, together with the opinion of the supreme
. , ... •..•*. .i_ •" <• • .
court, and with instructions to the inferior court, to commence
from the last regular-proceedings had thereon, and proceed to
trial and judgment, in the same manner as if no proceedings
had been had in the supreme court, taking the opinion of thesupreme
court as their guide: and in such cases, the party ha
ving committed the first error, shall pay to the opposite party,
such costs as the court shall order. When any Writ of error
shall have been made a supersedeas, and the judgment or de
cree so superseded, shall be affirmed in part or in whole, the
defendant in- error shall be entitled to the same damages, which
are allowed by this act, in case of appeals. If a decree in equi- c
ty be reversed, the supreme court may either render such a de
cree as the inferior court ought to have given, or may remand
the cause to the inferior court for further proceedings consistent
with the opinion of the supreme court.
Sec. 22. No writ of error shall^be brought after the expi- L
ration of five years, from the rendition of the judgment or decree
complained of; unless the plaintifff in error, shall have been, at
the time when such judgment or decree was made, an infant,
feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned, or out of the
limits of the United States on public business, in which case,'
the five years shall be computed from the time when such dis
ability ceased. • . -. , v .

shall he stayed or reversed, where it shall appear to the court,
that the merits of the case have been fairly and fully decided

brought for the same cause. But nothing herein contained
shall be construed to extend to, or cure any errors in the judg
ment of the court, in questions of law, which may have been
brought up before the court, by the pleadings, or otherwise, if
they appear upon the record. Whenever, on hearing an ap.peal
or writ-of error, the supreme court shall be equally divided in opinion, the suit shall be continued until the next term,
and if then the. court are still divided, the judgment or decree
of the inferior court shall be affirmed.
Sec. 24, The clerk of the supreme court, shall carefully
preserve the transcripts of records certified to his court, with
the bonds for prosecution, .and all papers relative.tb them, and
other cases pending in said court, docketing truem, in the order
in which he may receive them, that they may be heard in the
same order, unless the Court for good catose- to tfiem s}ie wn, may
direct any tote heard out -of his turn.' The proceedings of
every day during a term, shall be drawn up.at full lenth, by the
clerk against the next sitting of the court, and such corrections
as may be necessary, being first made therein, shall be signed
by the presiding judge. When any cause shall be finally de
termined, the clerk shall- make a complete record thereof, not
