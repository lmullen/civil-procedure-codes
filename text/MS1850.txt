strued,
with a view to substantial
justice between
the
parties; irrelevant or redundant matter, inserted in
in any pleading, may be stricken out on motion of
any party aggrieved thereby; and when the allega-
tions

apparent, the court may require the pleading to be
made definite
by amendment;

his part;

such allegation
be controverted,

the
party

pleading shall
be bound to establish,
on the
trial, the
facts showing

the
same
was

or spoken,
concerning
the
plain-
tiff, and

controverted, the plaintiff

shall be bound to establish, on trial, that it was

classes,

affect all
parties to
the action,
and not
require
different places of trial,
and must be separately
stated.

enacted, That
every ma-
terial
allegation of
the complaint,

allegation of new matter
in the

by the reply,
as

merits; whenever

leged
that
a party
has
been
so misled,
that
fact shalt
be proved
to
the satisfaction
of the
court,
and
in
what respect
he has
been misled,
and thereupon
the
court may order
the pleadings to be
amended upon
such
terms as may be just;
but when the variance
is not material,
the court
may
direct the
fact to be
found,
according
to the
evidence,
or
may order
an
immediate
amendment
without
costs;

how-
ever,
the
allegation
of
the cause
of action
or
defence
to
which the
proof is directed,
is
unproved,
not in
some
particular
or particulars
only, but
in its entire

it shall not be
deemed a case of
variance,
either
material
or immaterial,
but a failure
of proof.
