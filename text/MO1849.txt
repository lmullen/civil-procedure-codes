that he verily believes there are persons interested in the subject matter
of the petition, whose names he cannot insert therein, because they are
unknown to him, and shall describe the interest of such persons, and

6, of article V, the demurrer or answer shall be filed within the first two
,days after the return day of the summons, and the cause shall be tried

not, he may give in evidence the mitigating circumstances.

§ 12. The plaintiff may unite in his petition as many causes of action
as he may have; and in like manner the defendant may unite in his an-
swer as many grounds of defence, including offsets, as he may have, al-
though the same may heretofore have required different actions at law,
or an action or actions at law, and a suit or suits in equity. The plain-
tiff shall reply to the offsets in like manner as the defendant is required
to answer the matter set forth in the petition; and every material alle-~
gation in the petition not specifically controverted in the answer as
heretofore required, and every material allegation in the ansWer in re-
gard to an offset or offsets, not specifically controverted in the reply, as
above prescribed, shall for the purposes of the action, be taken, as true.
But the allegations in the answer not' relating to an offset, and the alle-
gations in the reply. shall not in any respect conclude the opposite ar-
ty, who may on the trial avail himself of any valid objection to their
s'ufliciency, or may controvert them by proof, either in direct denial or
by way of avoidance.

§ 13. If either party shall rely upon any record, deed, or other wri—
ting, he shall file with his pleading an authenticated copy of such re-
cord, and the original deed or other writing if in his power. If he can-
not produce such deed or other writin , he shall so state in his pleading,
together with the reasons therefor; anigi, if thé reasons he suflicient, he
may file the best evidence of the contents of such deeds or other wri-
tings, in his power. Original deeds and other writings filed by either
, party as above provided, shall remain on file for the inspection of the
other party, until allowed by the court to be withdrawn; and in such
case, copies tested by the clerk shall be substituted by the party with-
drawing the originals."

§ 1. N o variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof,
shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse
party to~his prejudice in maintaining his action or defence upon the mer—
its. When it shall be alleged that a party has been so mis ed, that fact
shall be roved to the satisfaction of the court, by aHidavit shewing' in
what res ect he has been misled; and thereupon, the court may order
the plea ings to be amended, upon such terms as shall be just.

§ 2. Where the variance is not material, as provided in the last sec-
tion, the court may direct the facts to be found according to the evi-
dence, or may order an immediate amendment without costs.

§ 3. Where, however, the allegation of the cause of action or defence
to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or
particulars only, but in its entire soope and meaning, it shall not be deem-
ed a case of variance within the last two sections, but a failure of proof.
In case of such failure of proof, and a verdict of the jury or finding of
the-court against the party so failing, and the court is satisiied from the
proof given that the party has a good cause of action or defence, as the'
case may be, and such party will apply for a new trial and undertake to
proceed without unnecessary delay, the court‘shall grant such new trial,
and permit the pleadings, if necessary, to be amended, on such‘terms as
may be just and reasonable. And in every case where there has been a
mistake or surprise of a party or his agent or attorney, or a misdirection
of the jury by the court, or a mistake by the jury, or a finding contrary
to the direction of the court‘ in any matter of law, or a fraud or deceit
practiced by one party on the other, or the court is satisfied that perjury
or mistake has been committed by a witness, and is also satisfied that an
impmper verdict or finding was occasioned by any of the matters afore~
said, and that the party has a just cause of action or defence, it shall
grant a new trial, and, if necessary, permit the pleadings to be amended, I
on such terms as may be just and reasonable. -

§ 4. Any pleading may be amended by the party of course, without
costs and without prejudice to the proceeding already had, at any time
before the answer to it shall be' filed.

§ 5. The court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on
such terms as mayfbe proper,‘jamend any pleading or proceeding, by add-
ing or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in

 

the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect material to the
case, or by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved.

§ 6. The court may, in every stage of the action, disregard any error
or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which shall not affect the sub-
stantial rights of the adverse party; and nojudgment shall be reversed or
affected by reason of such error or defect.

§ 7. The plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on
motion, to make a supplemental petition, answer or reply, alleging facts
material to the case, or praying for any other or different relief or order,
or judgment;

§ 8. When either party shall amend any pleading or proceeding, and
the court shall be satisfied, by affidavits or otherwise, that the opposite
party could not be ready for trial in consequence thereof, a continuance
may be granted to some day in the same term or to another term of the
court.
